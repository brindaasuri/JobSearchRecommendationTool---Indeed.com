Company,Job Title,Rating,Review
Walmart,General Maintenance Technician 2,3,Going home is the best partExpect more than job requirements but won’t pay for itThe problem is the favoritism were one person looks great while the rest are actually doing the work 
Walmart,Cashier,5,It was cool I like working here no issues and walk around but for the most part I liked it I don’t recommend wearing shoes that will hurt your feet though 
Walmart,Front End Manager,1,"The store was poorly managed, lacked any form of support for team to execute their jobs, poor communication, and really poor job/leadership development."
Walmart,Sales Associate/Cashier,3,"The management treated me unfairly. I asked to be in a different department several times or transfer out and it never happened. I wanted to grow in that company and they were very unfair with me. I worked there three and a half years, I'm not sure if I would try it again or recommend employment here."
Walmart,Automotive Technician,1,Coworkers would help you in a heart beat.Certain managers will wrongly terminate you in a heart beat for something that isn’t your fault at all They have their picks and chooses of the associates they like and if they don’t like you they will make your job a living nightmare and find anyway to make you quit or even terminate you.
Walmart,Cashier,3,Great pay.  Customers were a little rude tho.  Managers did help more than I expected.  The holidays were super busy.  It was nice for a first time jon. 
Walmart,Front End Service Associate,2,"Honestly working here was fun and okay for a while until you realize what an awful company Walmart is, not only do you have to work holidays that isn’t thanksgiving or Christmas but they also black out the days so you can’t take them off and if you call in double points, getting ppto is horribly slow and same with pto. Amazing people to work with. It’s just the company that sucks  "
Walmart,Asset Protection Associate,5,"Fair wages and good benefits, perks, hour lunches, nice break rooms, options to try out different departments, thorough training, good management.  Customers are probably the hardest thing about it but at the end of the day who really cares about them. They don’t pay your bills."
Walmart,Wal-Mart Associate,5,"I learned to work as a team, socialize very easy and learn more"
Walmart,Customer Service Associate,4,"I was offered and promised a full time position by multiple TLs after working 40 hours a week for months, but it never went through and nobody remembered when I brought it upRules change constantly and its difficult to keep track at times because if you weren't there when the first team meeting happened, you probably won't hear about it until they see you doing something wrong - unless it's over phone use, that's when they make an effort to pull everyone aside for it.That being said, it's a fairly easy and decent paying job for what it is, many of the leads and employees will treat you as family and defend you when customers act out aggressively"
Walmart,Apparel Associate,3,A very easy place to work as long as you do your work. It can get a little overwhelming as the amount of clothes there is but just do what you can and you’ll be okay.
Walmart,Floor Manager,2,Love Walmart! Love working here. Love the customers. Love the colleagues. I only hate that I have to go home at night instead of living in Walmart. Great job.
Walmart,Wal-Mart Associate,1,Horrible place to work (Murphy especially) poor management. They do not care about family life. Management cares about themselves. The pay sucks. they will schedule you without telling you. Then write you up for being a no show. I highly recommend to look for another job. Place is drama drama drama.
Walmart,Associate,2,"Low pay, tight time requirements. Other staff were nice, but I'm not a fan of management or the corporate culture. It's more or less what you would expect from Walmart."
Walmart,Online Grocery Pickup Associate,2,"Management plays favorites. If you are one of their favorites, you will have a good time working here because you get the time off you want and you can get away with doing pretty much anything such as skipping doing the hard physical labor. Customers are rude and generally draining to deal with. If you want time off, good luck unless you have accumulated enough PTO. If you are working hard, you probably won’t get recognized for it because someone who the management likes more gets all the recognition. "
Walmart,Personal Digital Shopper,4,"Worked a lot individually and as a team to meet daily metrics such as customer satisfaction, completing online orders on time, etc. It was fun, however very fast-paced. "
Walmart,Overnight Stocker,1,"First day on the job and the manager assigned to train me had ZERO interest in actually helping me with my job. I was given only the MOST BASIC instructions and then sent on my way. I attempted bringing this up with another manager and was told the exact same thing. I guess its a good job if you dont mind standing around with NOTHING to do until someone yells at you for slacking. Not even to mention the fact that I was SO overworked, and already tired from it being an overnight shift,on my first night that I had nearly passed out from exhaustion with managers giving absolutely ZERO regard for my health."
Walmart,Asset Protection Host,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?they don't tell the truth about your employment there if you were to leave or get firedWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?store management, the changing seasons and mean customers walmart will not protect you at allWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?over all the environment is ok if you never have to deal with customersWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?stressful long and dangerous and unsupportive"

Walmart,General Maintenance Technician 2,3,Going home is the best partExpect more than job requirements but won’t pay for itThe problem is the favoritism were one person looks great while the rest are actually doing the work 
Walmart,Pharmacy Assistant,4,"The pharmacy manager is alright, but the pharmacists can be mean and would yell at times. There is no way to get pay raise. Other pharmacy assistants are nice though."
Walmart,Cart Attendant,5,"It’s a fun and easy job. At times it gets hard because of the heat, especially in Texas but as long as you stay hydrated and take small breaks when you need too you should be good. It’s kind of a your on your own job. As long as you keep it full and do your job, you should be good."
Walmart,Personal Shopper,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Paycheck for me. There are upward movement opportunities.

It is a customer friendly company which can result in difficult encounters.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very pro-customer. Fast paced in certain jobs, slower in others.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Clock in, get to work, check in with team, check in with training. Lunch, then repeat, all while assisting customers as effectively as possible."
Walmart,Sales Associate,5,"Was a fun place to work, hours are inconsistent but that is to be expected with any retail place.  People were cool to work with, not a bad place to be."
Walmart,Asociado de piso de ventas,3,"Good first job, good school, but in the long term it is not worth it unless they give you the opportunity to study and grow there.I was associated with a home and everyone treated me badly, the manager, the subsequent, my area leader, customers, but as a company Walmart is good."
Walmart,OPD Associate,2,The job sucked little hours also get pulled to help other departments.Coach and team leads never give days off also point system sucks if you are actually sick or have something in your life going on.
Walmart,Retail Sales Associate,1,What is the best part of working at the company?The best par of working at Walmart arr the breaks and the lunch !What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The Stressful part is that they’re always short of staff so you’ve to Overwork your self to get the job Done What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic the always talking about each other is a soup opera What is a typical day like for you at the company?A Day For me Was very Nice Because I always stay to my self and I work Alone
Walmart,Stocker,3,The job was okay as a part time job over the Summer. Pay wasn’t amazing but the work was easy enough. Flexible hours and really great staff who make your day.
Walmart,Asset Protection Associate,4,"I greet and smile at all customers, help them with any questions and concerns about products, talk to my boss with any concerns or problems that arise with checking customers receipts, watch customers as they check out to make sure they pay for items, but there are times customers don't pay for items so I tell them it happens when checking out and they can go back and pay for them "
Walmart,Cashier ,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Easy job you will only be on the register only when it was very busy otherwise you will be put on self check out watching customers on the phone they provide on the app making sure no one is stealing.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?They change the rules almost every other day wanting you to do more but the managers & team leads never help you out just sit in their  office watching cameras all day What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It’s okay can be stressful when you are short staffed with no help left to do self checkout alone with angry customers What is a typical day like for you at the company?Depends on if you are full staffed or half staffed. Full staffed you will have some help. But if it’s short staffed you will be stressed out & have to worry about if you will get your breaks on time if you don’t speak up about it they will not give you one so speak up.
Walmart,Loader,3,The loader position is very physically demanding on the body. Pay is decent and the overtime opportunities are even better. The shift work can be incredibly exhausting due to the early hours and late evenings.
Walmart,Apparel Associate,5,They treated me like family. Team Leads are amazing. You get to be creative in terms of merchandising. TLs give you tasks and make sure that you know what you’re doing.
Walmart,Team Member,3,I had a decent time working here especially as it was my first job. Don’t expect to get paid much since it’s a bottom line job. I would recommend to anyone who is interested

Walmart,Overnight Stocker,3,"It's ok. Not for everyone. Working overnight. Lots of work, management is ok. Pay is ok. Part time is the way to go. Full time I don't recommend. Will take about 3 months to get use to working at night. Schedule is all over the place. "

Walmart,Digital shopper,2,"Mangers are rude, curse at you and will watch over you and show favoritism.Co-workers would complain about helping each other and don’t clean up behind themselves."
Walmart,General Maintenance Technician 2,3,Going home is the best partExpect more than job requirements but won’t pay for itThe problem is the favoritism were one person looks great while the rest are actually doing the work 
Walmart,Overnight Stocker,3,Overnight is okay since you just basically work by yourself to stock but other than takes a toll on you sooner. Only do overnight if you really need to
Walmart,almacenista,4,A lot of lack of communication is favoritism and to grow you must like all management of the opposite is impossible in addition to the environment is very toxic
Walmart,Stocker,5,The location I worked for had a great attitude but the pay wasn’t the greatest. The only complaint I have was the pay and stuff like that. Overall it is a good starter job. 
Walmart,Produce Associate,3,Not bad but write ups for  days that didn’t pertain to days I was in the department.  Other than that the coworkers were good to work with and everyone made it fun 
Walmart,Loader/Unloader,3,"Not a bad job, stay on your toes and work ahead and you’ll always be fine. Attendance is very important don’t use all your time at once it’ll come and save you later "
Walmart,Customer Service Representative,3,"I mean customers, associates, and management. The point absence system is not one that is implemented for employees benefit but it's not hard to stay in line. I enjoyed the culture but I was early twentys when I was there. As an older person, I don't think the culture is great but its not the worse."
Walmart,Cashier/Customer Serviceg,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Servicing customers, with a smileWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Nothing at all,you have to have a heart to work with customers,it's not about you it's the customers What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Friendly with customers and making happy and pleased so  willing to come backWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Everyday should be a pleasant day if you have the heart to work and serve people it should be an easy day for you and the customers"
Walmart,Online Grocery Pickup Associate,4,It was a satisfying and entertaining job but management cared more about times and stats than anything else. The schedule wasn't very flexible and they often denied time off requests.
Walmart,sorter/customer service ,3,"Good job, Horrible management. i wasn’t trained properly and i didn’t know my team lead for my first 2-3 weeks. when i wanted to quit they just took me off the schedule without officially letting me know i was fired."
Walmart,Cashier,5,"It was a super fun job. Great employees, great benefits, super fun. Great pay, can’t complain. This is fake, have to submit to see other reviews. Good luck"
Walmart,Cashier,5,I hate it don’t go don’t work there because they will treat you like cra  and they never appreciate how much hard work you put in to there projects  don’t 
Walmart,Walmart Distribution Center,5,Security is excellent benefits are excellent attention to the worker is excellent
Walmart,Front End Cashier,3,"it's retail, so not the best but not the worst. paid better than a lot of similar jobs in my small town. if you just need something to put food on the table while you look for something better, go for it."
Walmart,Lift Driver,3,Feel like just a number and replaceable no matter how long you’ve been with the company.  Get scolded for just talking to a coworker about a question. Pay is good though at the end of it all. 
Walmart,Seasonal Associate,3,"Typical work day is stocking shelves, even items I would rather not. The managers at my store willingly interact with all associates and show their appreciation for their work effort. The hardest part is that corporate feigns appreciation for all we do, otherwise turnover would be lots lower than it is."
Walmart,Online Grocery Pickup Associate,2,"Managers were always nowhere to be found, employees never did their job, one person always had to do the leads job. Employees would constantly disappear from their post and go off to lunch for longer than their supposed times. Managers would be trained by employees on how to do their job."
Walmart,ASM,4,Do yourself a favor don't work here. Nobody cares about you. Management only cares about the bottom line. No room for moving up in the company. Pay is bad.
Walmart,Lawn and Garden/Seasonal Depart Manager,2,"Depends on the management.  A good manager {servant leader} = a good and productive work environment.A not so good manager = complete chaos, no leadership, constant miscommunication."
Walmart,Cashier,2,"You cannot be one minute late or you get written up.  It gives you work experience. You can only stay in the position you started in, cannot move up unless you know someone. Very busy sometimes no breaks. "
Walmart,Senior Technician,3,The retail mindset of leadership has unrealistic goals on older run down end of life equipment. No paid holidays and overtime is after 40 hours . PTO time is according to hours worked and you have to use it for holiday’s. Great place to work for younger apprentices wanting to learn supermarket rack refrigeration. 
Walmart,General Maintenance Technician 2,3,Going home is the best partExpect more than job requirements but won’t pay for itThe problem is the favoritism were one person looks great while the rest are actually doing the work 
Walmart,Sales Associate,5,"Great benefits, good hours, and good pay. I enjoyed working there and they take care of you well. I would reccomend to anyone who is going to apply. Good management "

Walmart,Cap 2 Associate,3,"the people make it worth it, but the pay doesn’t. if you work at walmart, don’t expect to get a raise because they won’t give it to you. they are pretty flexible with shifts which is a plus"
Walmart,OMNI Customer Fulfillment Associate,4,"Worked early mornings for guaranteed 40 work week hours, coworkers were great people. Personally would keep working there if wage wasn't minimum, but otherwise pretty good"

Walmart,Associate,3,"Walmart is a convenient and affordable option for a wide range of products, but it may not always provide the best customer service or product quality."
Walmart,Cap 2 Associate,1,Over the past few years things are getting worse month bye month. Horrible management and even worse culture. Nobody is ever held accountable for their lack of productivity wich leads to the good employees having to have to pick up the slack without being compensated for it. 
Walmart,Greeter,5,Full benefits including 401(k) 6% per cent match.  Managers are good at making sure employees get breaks.  There are opportunities for advancement.  Better place to work than some.
Walmart,Overnight Stocker,2,Easy Job but expected to do way to much management always on your case and push to the limits. Also they promote the wrong people in roles they shouldn't be in 
Walmart,Stocker,3,Usaul pay hours great with my schedule  good days  & bad days depending on customers. Management sucks but who cares long as I got my pay went home choose wisley 
Walmart,Cap 2 Associate,1,This job is nothing short of horrible. You will hate your life every single day you work here. Management is horrible and loaded with favoritism. The pay isn’t worth the actual work. Cap 2 is treated like it doesn’t matter as well and is seen as a starting position only. 
Walmart,Electronics Sales Associate,3,"There’s nothing really special about this job. It’s pretty easy as all you really do is sell items in your department. The biggest problems with this job is management, which is usually the issue with any retail store. Overall it’s an ok first job as long as you aren’t expecting great managers and super flexible hours"
Walmart,Stocker,3,"Small store, big trucks and hard to stock at peak time during the day, management was okay from what I remember but like all managers they kinda sucked."
Walmart,General Maintenance Technician 2,3,Going home is the best partExpect more than job requirements but won’t pay for itThe problem is the favoritism were one person looks great while the rest are actually doing the work 
Walmart,Cashier,4,"I worked at Walmart for almost 5 years and when I look back at my time here, I genuinely did enjoy it. It's a job, but the people you work with make it fun and not so unbearable!:) "
Walmart,operador logistico,4,"Excellent loose or work schedule, although there is little growth opportunity, work is not so heavy, and bosses are very good, I recommend tr"
Walmart,Hardline ta,4,Pretty cool place to work honestly. Although I do think it’s a bit unfair the cart attendants make 15 while the associates make 11. I do think they deserve 15 but so do the associates.
Walmart,Sales Associate,3,"tedious work but it’s a minimum wage job can’t expect much more, overtime is always available snd if ur on time for u shift and semi do ur job you’ll be fine"
Walmart,Cashier,4,"Great place to work. Fun environment, friendly and helpful management. I worked there for  15 years and always felt supported from my coworkers and upper staff members."
Walmart,AP Customer Host,5,All managerial people are there to help one achieve their best.  Working 36+ hours a week and getting health insurance coverage and social security benefits are huge.
Walmart,Cashier/Service Desk,1,"Working front end, I loved most of my coworkers and most of the customers. Management was extremely rude and unprofessional, both to the workers as well as to the customers. It was embarrassing and sad, and nothing like the standard Sam Walton would tolerate when he was alive. I worked for a year, repeatedly asked to be full-time. Was told multiple times by different members of management that they would look into it. They finally offered me a full-time position with a set schedule, but once I took that role, my hours were actually cut to 4 / week (not a typo). Many others experienced something similar as well. During this time, they hired many new employees that were irresponsible. It was an insult to see so many good employees basically forced to find new jobs while less qualified individuals were hired and given lots of hours, during preferable times of the day. Absolutely disgusting. The employees and the customers deserve better. "
Walmart,Packer/Sorter,1,"Very  bad environment! Mostly all the people in this warehouse are about controlling, and manipulating people. If your’e a empath they will try to take advantage of you! The clerks in cons are a hot mess! They try to control you, and treat you like they’re your boss. They all think they have power of people. I got hired on full time after 4 months of working there, and decided to quit two weeks later. This warehouse is infested with immature, rude, and bad people! "
Walmart,Stocker,3,Would have to stock shelves overnight withing a specific time frame. If you didn't complete within that time frame you would end up in the office and considered low performance. 
Walmart,Walmart OGP,5,The most enjoyable part of the job is free food in the break rooms and on minority of holidays/ seasonal our company brings together everyone celebrating each holiday. 
Walmart,Cashier,2,"Manager never paid us, messy work environment, and long shifts. But there were some really kind co workers there and some really nice perks you can get"
Walmart,"Ciudad de México, CDMX",1,"A little empathic treatment by the superiors, they pretend that it becomes too and fast for how little they pay. In theory (what they say in online training) all good but being on the floor everything was different, a farce"
Walmart,Front End Manager,1,i would rather have managed the entire country than manage a front end at any Walmart. it was one of the worst possible experiences of my entire life changed me for the worst. walmart should pay for AA counseling and therapy for all associates.
Walmart,employee person,2,"Stable Environment: The company provides a steady work environment with minimal drama. It’s a good place for those who prefer routine and predictability.Decent Pay: Compensation is fair for the industry standard, though there’s little room for negotiation or bonuses.Supportive Coworkers: The team I worked with was friendly and helpful, which made the daily grind more bearable.Cons:Lack of Growth Opportunities: There were limited chances for professional development or upward mobility. It felt like many employees were stuck in their roles without clear paths to advancement.Average Management: While my direct supervisor was approachable, management overall seemed disengaged from employee feedback and often missed opportunities for improvement.Monotonous Tasks: The day-to-day responsibilities became repetitive quickly, which made it hard to stay motivated."
Walmart,Produce Associate,3,Fast paced work environment where you are by yourself doing a two person job most days. Expect to do about two times the work you have time for and feel rushed.
Walmart,Cashier,5,Really fun and exciting times can get busy but good coworkers. I feel like part of the family and sometimes I get perks and benefits from others in the company 
Walmart,Experiencia Laboral,5,Very good workplace and good work environment a place to form experience and good management better the schedules are a bit difficult has very good incentives
Walmart,Cashier,1,Not that great. Attendance rules are extremely strict which to a extent is understandable but when it's ordered by a doctor for a 2 week extended period something should be set to where you don't have that fully counting against you
Walmart,Food/Consumables,3,they had me zoning shelfs after a couple of months i got bored of doing it so i asked for a differnet position. they had me running around doing random things like a chicken with its head chopped off and couldnt seem to find me a position.
Walmart,Stocker,3,It’s okay but favorites are chosen and get certain aisles while others get harder aisles to work on. Has new management a lot. Everybody leaves. Is quick to fire for points
Amazon.com,Warehouse Worker/Delivery Driver,4,"In my time with the company, I’ve experienced a positive work culture where collaboration and open communication are encouraged. A typical day at work involves balancing tasks efficiently with clear guidance from management, making it easier to handle challenges. The management team is approachable and fosters a growth-oriented environment, and I’ve learned invaluable skills in time management, teamwork, and problem-solving. While the workload can be demanding at times, the team spirit and supportive environment make it enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of accomplishment that comes with meeting targets and the camaraderie among colleagues.” Let me know if you need further adjustments!"
Amazon.com,Stocker,4,"It was very easy and a fun job, my boss was very nice and the atmosphere was good. However the pay was not very good and it was really really hard to get a raise"
Amazon.com,Account Manager,5,Workplace is busy. You have to keep focused. They have great benefits and great opportunities to advance. They give holiday meals. They also respect break times.
Amazon.com,Warehouse Associate,1,You get what you get at amazon sometimes its busy sometimes its not but one thing you can look forward to is the layoffs that come with working for the company
Amazon.com,Manager,5,Easy to work for good company etc. very challenging how ever good & well paid no breaks etc if you need a poo can be hard to hold it in as your on the run 
Amazon.com,Stower,1,This was the worse job ever labor was terrible you barely get a break and they don’t care because you are times so if they see you aren’t working you getwrote up
Amazon.com,Associate,5,Great company face pace work good breaks just have to stand up for long periods it okay tho seasonal especially if you have a disability get a job pay is good will pay for college 
Amazon.com,Logistics Assistant,5,"I found the HR issues VERY disorganized. I was verbally informed by the interim manager that the probationary contract would end on 5/10. I sent an email to HR to inform them that my contract would end at the end of the year, as I wanted to know if I would need to return the following week. I did not even receive an email formalizing the end of the contract. And they called on Monday to find out why I was absent. I went to work on Tuesday (and for another 3 days). Finally, last Saturday my app stopped working, which confirmed the end of the contract. I do not have access to the payslips and HR did not formalize the end of the contract. A lot to be desired and needs to be clearer. It would be great to have a manual with what is really expected of those who are entering temporary contact. The metrics only became clear when it was too late to reverse it.I really enjoyed working at Amazon, and I have great admiration for the leaders and managers. But I think the HR system left a lot to be desired and needs to be cleared."
Amazon.com,Shift Supervisor,2,Non-stop from start to finish at least my days went by fast. Management team always increasing demands and requirements. Overwhelming pressure to constantly change or increase productivity. Human being can only do so much. 
Amazon.com,Marketing Executive,4,"A good place to work and to develop your skills however, they are not reluctant at all to treat you like a number and replace you at a whim if any issues were to arise."
Amazon.com,Learning Ambassador,4,"Not bad I enjoyed working there, great People and management, just wish they kept up the Hygiene of the place, I trained new employees like every week "

Amazon.com,Picker and Packer,5,Had a team that was just fun to work with I miss those guys and girls…. Supervisors always nice and to me it was just fun I wish I never left but weather in Bakersfield was just to much for me and family wanted to move….. the best job I’ve ever had it’s was just plain fun for me. They even had a lot of variety of food and snacks and drinks in the break rooms….. not to mention a stress free environment with arcade games💪🏻 best job hands down
Amazon.com,Volunteer,4,Manager’s are very helpful and try to help you succeed. There are many opportunities to ask questions during training. The resources provided also make it easy to find an answer on your own before reaching out to a manager
Amazon.com,IT Support Technician / Physical Security Support Engineer,5,"“Amazon is a great place to work, with ample opportunities for growth and development. The fast-paced environment helped me sharpen my skills, and I appreciated the supportive team culture. Management was transparent, and the company’s focus on innovation always kept things exciting. While the workload can be demanding at times, it’s rewarding to see the impact of your contributions. Overall, it’s a fantastic place to build a career.”"

Amazon.com,Site Lead,3,"Leads used to be able to cover more locations and be more hands on for learning what managers do to help them move up. Also, we used to be able to take any two days off as long as we worked one weekend day per week but they changed that. I had the best boss that really helped me and tried his best to make it a tolerable work place but even he had to move on to another company with how much his former boss and the system screwed him.If you work at a big city or willing to move to one, I think there's plenty of room for career advancement and they're hiring more managers this and next year so it might be good to stick around if you like the job. It was 70~80% customer service and covering shifts and 20~30% sitting down and doing the admin works.There are good tuition assistance program along with other training routes especially if you want to learn about IT, coding, and engineering even.

While many find the challenges rewarding, others may feel overwhelmed by the pace and pressure. Benefits are competitive, and the company invests in training and resources, which can enhance job satisfaction.The team atmosphere varies by department; some employees thrive on collaboration, while others may find a more independent work style.

Amazon.com,Fulfilment Centre Associate,3,Managers focus solely on following orders and blaming frontline staff rather than helping to solve problems. Whether your work goes smoothly often depends on your personal relationship with management
Amazon.com,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,1,"Like the title says don't work too hard here. If you're a hard worker the only thing you'll get is more work. You'll get moved from one workstation to another, you'll be forced to cross train and sent between to different departments. Does amazon give bonuses to people who are cross trained or are working above the minimum rate? Nope, you'll just get abused. If you decide to slow down your work pace a little management will harass you. You'll get put on workstations without fans or anything else that they can come up with, they'll even insult you. Many people have transferred to DEN4 from other FC's and most have nothing but complaints, so it isn't just me.Managers lie about minimum expected rates also. You might not ever know what's actually expected of you until you're written up. Where I worked all of the focus was on speed. We were told to work safely but they don't actually care about that. Just work as fast as possible and if you get injured then it's your fault for not working safely."

Amazon.com,Amazon Air Associate,1,"Amazon lures you in with day one benefits, decent pay, and the talk of growing your career. The truth, you are worked to pure exhaustion daily, treated as a number, and are fearful of losing your job daily. The promise of growth gets you to a tier 3 position, which is a process Assistant. As a pa you become the person management uses to blame their failures on. As a tier 1 (basic associate) you are trained to do whatever you are capable of, but the better a worker you are the more you are used and treated poorly. Bad employees thrive at Amazon. Good employees get worn down and forced out. If you make it to wanting to pursue a management position, you better have a degree. Amazon is notorious for saying they “promote from within “ and then hiring a newly graduated college student with no experience in the wear house community . No experience in work in general. The managers that do get promoted from within are few and are pushed out quickly. "

I started out as a tier 1 in 2020. Amazon will develop anyone that shows the skill, intelligence, and drive to evolve and move up the company. They do external promotions for college hires, but they also promote from within. I got my tier 3 position in a year and a half, and my l4 position a year after that. They are constantly working on continuous improvement strategies and are evolving with the times by offering good benefits packages and time off options. You get time off in 3 different forms - PTO, Unpaid Time, and Vacation time. It's quite a bit of time off, and each year you stay, you get more vacation the next year due to tenure. They offer to help pay up to 5.2k a year on tuition in specific college courses via their career choice program. This benefit is unlocked after 90 days with the company. They do a 4% match for their 401k, as well. Amazon has many resources to help their employees and always strives to put our safety and health as their top priority. They are under a lot of scrutiny right now as such a big nationwide company, but they are one of the best out there as far as warehouse work/culture goes. "

If you apply for jobs they have many ways of moving up but you have to work for them and apply also ask for help with interviews. We have some of the best benefits  also offer fractional share purchase and 401k with a 4% $.50 match.  Amazon has pages of help for families in crisis , leaves of absence and generous time off options.

From managers recommending substance abuse to cope with mental health strains, to a complete lack of work/life balance (Apple expects Apple to be your work life). The internal culture is even more of a cult than it's fandom and was honestly the worst work experience of my career. Work for anyone else, anyone."
Apple,Technical Lead,4,Lots of fun and recommend for lots of college studentsGreat pay and flexible work schedule to fit your needs.You have a lot of opportunities to move up in the company both in retail and corporate.

Apple,Manager,3,"Word to the wise: if you're happy in your current role, and everything is going great, do not look for the greener grass and then transfer to another city and location. It's never the same."
Apple,Recruiter,4,I worked long hours but the benefits were great so it was hard to move on from the job when they time came. I wish there was a little more effort put into the work/life balance.
Apple,College at home advisor,4,"You have to be emotionally strong but it’s doable. Pretty flexible wit college schedules. Overall, there is not much progression. Don’t do it if you think this is your “ticket in”.”"
Apple,Mentor,4,No longer allowing real promotions or new roles unless you're near an office. Great benefits and kind people but the remote roles are no longer desirable.
Apple,Software Engineer Intern,3,"You come in and shadow engineers for the first month and then you spend the second month in a trial run. Everyone is nice and willing to teach you but not enough time learning , I would say. "
Apple,Operations Specialist,5,"Being in the back can be a lot of work, if you are willing to be someone that likes never running out of things to do, you’ll like it. Also if you had a great team like I did it’ll make the experience that much better "
Apple,Store Associate,5,"people are friendly and it feels cool to work there, i had ti leave because i had to move places, but overall, it was good atmosphere, could get busy here and there, but just get the job done"
Apple,Sales Associate,3,It’s just about what you’d would expect from a big tech chain. Everything is fairly regimented but there’s not a whole lot of stimulation or challenge. 
Apple,Soporte Técnico,5,Good brand but I think it could be improved by giving more prices accessibility since they are very expensive and very cheap to design and create but out of that good brand
Apple,Part time Specialist,5,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  

The managers were all great and they were never above doing what they asked of their employees. 

The benefits and pay were amazing for a part time job.  

Working for a company with a brand such as Apple and experience to match that brand made me want to stay forever.

Apple,Sales Assistant,2,"Over rated with very few promotion prospects nowadays.Big on diversity, very poor on family life.Nice staff, management okay, but unable to make any significant change."
Apple,Specialist,2,"One of the best jobs I've ever had. Apple do look after you with lots of benefits. When I first started I was told you would be part of the family and looked after. I was so excited but nervous at the same time. For the first maybe 7 or 8 weeks things were amazing. Then they took a turn.I started to notice that there were groups of people. Clicks as it were and if you were not in this group, you would be spoken about.Someone who started with me got on very well with a lead. This was nice but as time moved on a few people noticed that this member received special treatment. For example, rather than serving customers, they could tidy the shop to avoid customers. I was tasked to work with this colleague and a lot of the time they went out the back for a drink or a toilet break. At the end of the day, we were both praised for our hard work. I had also finished a lot more work which this colleague took credit for. I do enjoy working as part of a team but when the team decide they will come to work to chill out, it makes it harder to deal with. After a few months, I was offered a chance to go for a role. There were two positions open and the colleague in question said he did not prepare for this interview and had no experience there. I've done this kind of work before but I was shot out. This colleague managed to get a third position that opened up out of nowhere. It was a good thing because after speaking to the colleague they explained to me how they didn't like customers. Another colleague was told he wasn't allowed to go for the role as there were too many men in the bar - more..."

Apple,Supervisor,3,"enough to make a living but many goals to meet, could have better pay but i won’t complain, otherwise really nice people and it’s a great work experience."
Apple,Planner,3,It has a big name but culture can be very toxic. Pay is better than other retailers. 4 weeks of remote working a year. Good benefits and on site healthcare and gym.
Apple,Specialist,5,"You’ll get the chance to learn about all of the devices and develop great customer service skills. Find ways to connect with ever customer you meet! Most employees are chill, resourceful and want to see you succeed!"
Apple,better than you,1,"I hate Indeed because their platform has become a frustrating experience for both job seekers and employers. The job postings are often outdated, spam-filled, or irrelevant, making the search process a nightmare. What’s worse is their management, who seem disconnected from the user experience. Instead of addressing core issues like spam filters and ensuring job accuracy, they focus on pushing paid features that don’t deliver results. As a job seeker, I've seen the same job recycled over and over with no real updates, while employers complain about being flooded with unqualified applicants. It feels like management is more concerned with profit than improving the platform’s functionality. Their customer service is unhelpful, slow, and often dismisses concerns, which shows how little they value their users. The platform's once-decent reputation is being dragged down by mismanagement, and it’s clear that they’re losing touch with what really matters: delivering quality service."
Apple,Specialist,5,"working here was probably one of the besy jobs in my life. if i could i would reapply and work there forever. the benifits were great, the pay, the culture was amazing. "
Apple,Analyst ,2,"Your colleagues are encouraged to report on you even if you commented on your own weight. People don’t trust one another and the  worst part is it doesn’t matter how hard you work. If the wrong clique doesn’t like you, management wouldn’t consider you for job advancement regardless of your results. "
Apple,Red Zone Specialist,3,"The benefits offered by Apple for both FT and PT are second to none! However, for people who aren't a people person this will be a tough job. You'll be in an environment with a lot of different kind of people."
Apple,Operations Specialist,5,Work culture fantastic and get to meet so many different people. You’d love to work here if you like 0 micro managing and people who actually care about you.

Apple,Research Scientist,5,"Obviously every team within Apple (or any big company) is different, but here's a review of my team.Pros:- Very interesting projects.- Autonomy to work on problems you like.- Very competitive pay. It may be a bit lower than some other companies in the Bay Area, but it's still very good, and the interesting pay more than makes up for the difference.Cons:- There's really only one: super slow promotion cycles.

Apple,iOS Engineer,1,"While the company has a strong reputation, my personal experience was disappointing. The work environment was more stressful and less collaborative than I expected. Project management was often disorganized, leading to unrealistic deadlines and poor work-life balance.

CVS Health,Cashier/Customer Service,1,"first they wanted you to do jobs for three people, so basically when you work you have to do three positions at one, sometimes no breaks even 7 or 8 hours street, when they changed the manager every three years, that manager bring all his friends and family to that store and keep cutting hours to the people who work there for long beside that they can take your days and give to his friends  bonus and rise again only for family and friends. and no mater if you work very hard then anyone they don't care about you. and all the stores are the same."
CVS Health,Business Analyst,1,Huge corporation doesn’t care too much about individual workers. Raises are pretty standard and there’s lot of opportunities to move around in the company 
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,4,Enjoyed the atmosphere. You get to come to work and help others. Most of the time co-workers were great. Only issue was the flexibility of scheduling. 
CVS Health,Front Store Associate ,4,"So far so good, I have only worked 3 shifts but I like the opportunity to work at other stores in my area. I have already done a shift at another store. They were prompt when contacting me and asking if I would like to cover a shift.  Lots of opportunities for advancement as well it seems. "
CVS Health,Warehouse Associate,5,"Staying focus and dependable to do better n focus on ur goals the company is very good to work with the pay is good , opportunity is great and I love the ppl very smart n on point I love it all "
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Nothing at all, they play too many games with people's livelihood. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not being a sycophant and having to pick up the work load of high school minded adults What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's like going back to preschool What is a typical day like for you at the company?It all depends on who you give praise and suck up to."
CVS Health,"CVS Pharmacy, Sales Associate",5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Schedule time,TrainingCommute What is the most stressful part about working at the company?None stressful time Friendly Associates What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Respectful environment,Clean and organized community What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy, Monday through Sunday, None"
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,4,A lot of demand and not enough people on shift at the same time. CVS doesn’t provide enough hours per work for techs to make it lighter.  Wish there was more raises as the work we do with the type of people that come feels not compensated enough. 
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,3,The customers…..always enjoyed getting put on filling station because you are away from the customers. Several locations that i worked at had designated people on fill station and it wasn’t because they were good at their job it was because they were friends with the boss.
CVS Health,Cashier,4,"The product quality is consistently outstanding, exceeding my expectations every time. Easy and simple. Great places to make easy money. Managers are good."
CVS Health,Pharmacist,1,Terrible.  See dollar signs not patients.  Worst ever. Never got vacation weeks wanted even after ten years of employment.  Cut hours with no raise plus inflation = yearly pay cuts.
CVS Health,Certified Pharmacy Technician,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?CVS has great benefits and room for advancement. It is also a great starting point for people who need experience. The pay, and benefits have really been great as well. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with the public, lack of training with different tasks. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Can be toxic, but it depends on the people you work with. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Fast pace, multitasking, usually a fast fun day but like any job it has its days. Overall I enjoy working here."
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,3,"Job can be stressful at times but they are very flexible with scheduling.  Usually a mix of early and later shifts.  Definitely not boring, good variety of stuff to do in the day"
CVS Health,Benefits Specialist,1,This place has definitely hanged my mental health for the worst . The calls are back to back from the moment you clock in until you leave . They don’t want you in after all work for more then 30 second even zero seconds if you can. We handle everything the other departments do nothing and the pay is not great .
CVS Health,Nurse Practitioner ,1,Reduction in staff and increased responsibilities for providers with reduced time with patients. Poor reimbursement and zero commitment to employees. 
CVS Health,Retail Management Intern,3,The internship really depends on the store your assigned to. Some store managers will actually teach you how the store is ran and some will use you as a regular cashier the entire internship. I experienced the latter.
CVS Health,Cashier ,3,Once management switched everything went down hill… having a understanding manager and someone who cares about their employees is important in the work place.
CVS Health,Customer Service Representative,5,Not a gear company to work for I had no good co working partners who wanted to help me out I was in my own got a love now more stores by me sho who have 
CVS Health,Warehouse Worker,4,It was a good place to work while there was work. Covid amped up everything and allowed many to work who hadn’t been able to before.  Would definitely work there again.
CVS Health,Pharmacist,1,Horrible place to place at . Constantly losing techs and no help . Stressed out techs and managers . Can never meet ridiculous workload minimums for vaccines  and carepasses 
CVS Health,Store Manager,2,"Being a store manager has a lot of responsibilities with inadequate pay and support. You’re still very low on the totem pole and employees know you are powerless, even with scheduling when it comes down to it. "
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?You'll acquire skills working with others as CVS has no permanent pharmacists always rotating but worst payWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?No permanent staff always shortage and drug not delivered ontime.Customers get angry and curse What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Unpredictable due to more temporary staff What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful and busy , phones ring non stopCVS never answers calls"
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,3,"Understaffed and under appreciated. Technicians and pharmacists are constantly calling out, corporate goals are not realistic. Patients are hit or miss"
CVS Health,Supervisor Trainee,5,So far so good and my interviewer was really nice and informative about the job. I'm really looking forward to starting my upcoming career with this company. They are incredibly dedicated to amazing customer service while also caring about their employees ensuring a good work life balance. 
CVS Health,Manager,1,The store was always chaos. Truck days were harsh. The call outs and bad customer service was tiring. The store was not successfully it was just convenient.
CVS Health,Pharmacist,4,Long onboarding and minimal training before being  thrown to the wolves.   Work load extremely heavy and immunizations are scheduled far too close together and too close to opening and closing.   
CVS Health,Store Associate,4,"I haven’t started work yet, but I’m excited to. It seems like a fun environment to work in and I love to work with the public to increase their health and answer any of their health needs. "
CVS Health,Bilingual Customer Service Representative,5,Very profesional very sweet and awesome explained everything and details everything working from home answering calls and most of all taking care of customer is the primer. 
CVS Health,Shift Supervisor,2,I have been at CVS for a while now and starting issues have been huge as hours are very lacking and management is unable to gain more hours. Good part time with a good work ethic.
CVS Health,Stocker,2,"job isnt hard but when the store is busy things get hectic, you need to like your coworkers if youre going to work at CVS. Feeling accepted was an issue for me since theres a lot of communication that needs to go on while working"
CVS Health,Cashier,4,"The product quality is consistently outstanding, exceeding my expectations every time. Easy and simple. Great places to make easy money. Managers are good."
CVS Health,CVS Shift Supervisor,1,"the management at this company is awful, they do not care about you. both at a store level and at a corporate level. the customers make the job even worse, they treat you like you're not an actual person, you're constantly ridiculed, yelled at, and insulted for situations that aren't your fault. wages are competitive and are not fair for the amount of work being done. you can do way more than is expected of you and your coworkers and managers will still be disappointed with the work you've done. no matter how much you do here and how well you execute your work, they will always find some flaw to correct and you will never be appreciated."
CVS Health,Cashier,5,loved working here and putting away all the go backs. There is nothing better than working here. Great pay. Amazing people. Good beneifts and i like the c
CVS Health,Supervisor,5,Working there was very straightforward and not stressful at all. Enjoyed my coworkers and managers. If you like to go to work and enjoy your day this is the place. 
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,4,Very stressful but good team makes it easier to work. Shifts are flexible. Some morning and evenings. Every other weekend but goof money so not too bad if you look at it like that.
CVS Health,Omnichannel Manager / ScrumMaster & Project Manager,4,"Highly recommend, lots of opportunity and great colleagues. Lots of opportunity to grow and contribute. Extremely innovative and willing to think outside of the box."
CVS Health,Customer Service Representative,5,"I worked at the CVS help desk for about 6 months AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT BY ANY MEANS. It’s the only job I’ve ever walked out on and the shortest amount of time I’ve ever worked somewhere. You’re just a number and a set of metrics to them. All they care about is how fast you can churn out calls and troubleshooting tips before throwing you back into the queue. Theyre more about numbers (call time, how long it takes to log your call notes, how often you call floor support for help, etc) than actually taking care of store associates calling for assistance. If you like IT and don’t mind literally being on the phone all day flying blind from one issue to the next then go for it."
CVS Health,Sales Associate,3,It was fair but I didn't like being cashier all the time but you will see lots of shopping happening everyday.  Other than that it's ok for entry level job nothing too exited hours and pay is fair.
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,2,"Okay job to get entry experience in the pharmacy field. But CVS operates on tight deadlines and target goals that sometimes are almost impossible to achieve. Almost always short staffed, hours are inconsistent."
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,4,"Most enjoyable part of my job is to make customers smile and leave worry-free. Customers are what make the atmosphere here at the company. If they are unhappy, then the job is not performed correctly. Being able to get our customers helped within a certain time frame and allowing them to voice their concerns, gratitude, etc., really makes the job worth while. "
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,1,"worst workplace ever, my mental health deteriorates with every passing day here. expectations to do the work of multiple people instead of upper management allowing for more hours and staff"
CVS Health,Shift Supervisor,5,Very very very very good job the people are very nice good and calm work environment. Paid very well for position and great hours management is great and very good with communication 
CVS Health,Clerk/Cashier,1,typical day at work is dealing with rude customers and management expects you to be always nice.did not learn anythingmanagement not sinceredealing with customerscustomer i knowworkplace culture if  you are not in with management you will never get promoted
CVS Health,Customer Service Representative,5,"Overall, working as a customer service representative at CVS provides good experience in customer service and healthcare retail. It’s a decent starting point if you want to get a foot in the door, but be prepared for the typical challenges that come with retail, such as demanding customers and a fast-paced environment. If you’re looking for flexibility and enjoy interacting with people, CVS could be a good fit, though advancement and compensation may leave you wanting more."
CVS Health,Cashier,5,"I love this job would highly recommend it. They treat their employees fairly, and the hours are fair as well. I worked overnight shift, which was very interesting"
CVS Health,Physician Assistant,4,Loved the autonomy of decision making and safety of limited practice. Treat em and street em may not work for some. CVS huge corporation so lots of consistency which may seem robotic.
CVS Health,Certified Pharmacy Technician (CPhT),1,"I have never heard of a good nor healthy experience working for this company. They will overwork you and then expect more. You want a day off? Good luck. You have a fever? Take some Tylenol and continue as normal. You're having a personal emergency? Okay, come back as soon as it's over, and we will spam text you and call you to know when you're coming back. Want a holiday off? Nice joke. The store is literally flooded because there iss an active hurricane? Ok. We expect you to come in early to help out. You're working a graveyard shift and the next shift hasn't arrived yet? You have to wait an indefinite amount of time until they do. Managers will behave like big brother and watc h your every move from the cameras. "
CVS Health,Director,4,"Great place to work.  I enjoy my team and my supervisor.  We have common goals and we go after accomplishing them.  Like any company, you are expected to perform and meet goals."
CVS Health,CSR - Customer Service Representative,4,"CVS Health is a really great company to work for. I can truly say CVS Health was the best call center job I’ve worked, and I truly wouldn’t mind returning. BTW the pay is really good and you could definitely live decent with the income. Management made sure to make you feel like family vs an employee. The CSR role is remote. I’ve learned so much about different prescription  insurance coverage and how the pharmacy operate to make sure every member receive their prescriptions "
CVS Health,Order Selector,5,They are very undertanble very comfortable I love my job we are happy at work it's a verry big company when responsible his really welcome the staff very pleasant 
CVS Health,Store Associate,5,"I haven't started work yet, I am doing assessment I found manager is excellent behavior as well as other staffs are. I hope will be fit into teamwork in future"
CVS Health,Cashier,4,"The product quality is consistently outstanding, exceeding my expectations every time. Easy and simple. Great places to make easy money. Managers are good."
CVS Health,Shift Supervisor,1,"The manager was always disrespectful, the workers are flakey and I was always pressured into doing 14 hour days and I worked about 40 hours every week but I was only a part time employee."
CVS Health,Shift Supervisor,4,Everyone was great and I enjoyed my time there a lot. I left because I couldn’t work the overnights for them but over all a great place to work and great pay.
CVS Health,Beauty Consultant,5,"Great company, great benefits. I was pleasantly surprised at all the benefits it offered. Pay is good for my position and duties. Great work life balance and opportunity to move Around and up."
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,4,"Work flow is always heavy, but nothing unbearable. Might be a different story for 24 hour stores. In general, the work culture is pretty upbeat and they also have decent benefits."
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,5,A very unique experience I’d be happy to get an opportunity as good as this! Everyone is very professional and productive doing their own jobs. The interviewer was very nice and friendly.
CVS Health,Sales Associate,3,"The job itself is simple, and the pay is not bad. However I found that at my particular workplace there was so much drama between employees, and wasn’t a healthy environment to be around."
CVS Health,Customer Service Representative,5,I loved CVS was there 3 years awesome job left for a better opportunity out of state loved the work environment managers great definitely a good starter job
CVS Health,Store Associate,5,Enjoyable part is dealing with customers. The manager and the other teammates are awesome. I enjoy my work. Workplace culture is very good and people are friendly and helpful.
CVS Health,Customer Relations Representative,2,The job itself is not hard but they preach empathy and have little to no empathy towards their own employee they nit pick at everything on your calls. They pay less then you should be getting you should receive 20/hr for what you do
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,3,"Fast paced and stressful. Management throws things at you every day, giving you more work, they don't care when you burn out, they keep pushing you as far as you'll let them"
CVS Health,Order Selector,2,The workplace is very unfriendly and they don't pay enough. They also fire good people. Management should promote more people. I think the company has a long way to go.
CVS Health,Shift Supervisor RX,5,Hardest part about the job was unloading the truck but I loved working with the customers  the coworkers were the best at cvs.  The truck was the most difficult to do because there was usually a lot to unload.
CVS Health,Sales Associate,1,long hours. on your feet a lot. clean and restock the store and load and unload the truck before morning shift starts. everything has to be done in a timely manner.
CVS Health, Shift Supervisor,5,The most enjoyable part of the job . Collegue everyone worming as a Team. Helping each other.Ive been long years working at CVS a lot of fun. My manager is very nice to everyone.
CVS Health,Shift Supervisor,3,"it’s ok there is a lot of favoritism depending where u work at. There is a lot of chaos but u will get the hang of it once you start to work there, same thing every single day"
CVS Health,Shift Supervisor,2,"Worked for only a few months with quick 3 day training. Had to figure everything else out on my own. Made simple mistake of not ‘reading the fine print’ and when I say ‘fine print’ I mean it. Small and easily dismissed. Fired over small coupon mistake with no second chances.  Store manager was good to me. Hr part of the store had no concern for my well being. Stuck with deliveries and restock day in and day out, constantly giving customer service with no break. Put my butt to work for this store and they were very quick to replace me. Again HR HAS NO CARE FOR YOUR WELL-BEING AND NO SECOND CHANCES. Don’t make mistakes at CVS. "
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,5,I’ve been a Pharmacy technician at CVS for about 3 years now and they have shown to be able to be so flexible with my schedule while I have been in school. People are friendly and manager are understanding for the most part.
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Nothing my experience was horrible working for cvs What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Poor Management was the most stressful What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It’s horrible and I wouldn’t recommend anyoneWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?A typical day is very busy doing everything by myself and alone and very stressful
CVS Health,Store Associate,4,"Worked here for over 5 years. Store Manager is awesome and so is the other staff. Worst thing about it is the customers and their coupons. I was pretty experienced, so after a while I knew how to handle a lot of issues that came up. "
CVS Health,Staff Pharmacist,1,What is the best part of working at the company?nothing. don't work here its terribleWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?everything is bad. don't work hereWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?toxic. it makes you want to kill yourselfWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?terrible everyday every second non stop. imagine reliving the worst day of your life every minute every day
CVS Health,Cashier,4,"The product quality is consistently outstanding, exceeding my expectations every time. Easy and simple. Great places to make easy money. Managers are good."
CVS Health,Nurse Practitioner,3,"It is ok. My manager is fantastic, but the higher/highest powers at be obviously make decisions based on the bottom line vs human experience.  Expect one person to do five different jobs. Some days you feel empowered in your position, and some days you feel like another number - easily replaceable.  There are several people in leadership that actually have experience in healthcare including a fantastic quality and safety team.  "
CVS Health,Outbound Customer Service Representative,3,Processing reportsLearning how to multitaskingManagement is supportiveDealing with coworkers Working on your own time The only thing I really don't like is the occurrence policy you can only have 3 a year a they don't fall off until the next year. Say your get an occurrence in October it won't fall of until October 2025
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,3,"great coworkers, unorganized and not enough help. When hired part time no guarantee for hours. After flu season over cvs corporate will cut hours but there will still be just as much work without the extra help. "
CVS Health,Cashier/Sales Associate,4,Working there at cvs was actually not bad and it was very chill. Don’t get me wrong sometimes the customers would be rude but that didn’t really bother me but yeah cvs was a nice place 
CVS Health,Store Associate,4,"From the beginning, the manager has been really nice and informative throughout the whole process. I received a call to come in for an interview about a week after I applied and it went really smoothly. I’ve yet to start orientation, but I’m excited to start!"
CVS Health,Pharmacist,1,"CVS is the most toxic workplace ever, it will physically and mentally affect you every day and even after you leave the company. Highly recommend to look elsewhere unless desperate for a job."
CVS Health,Pharmacist,1,Stressed out of my mind. Everybody leaving for a reason. Literally no experienced people left! Tiniest pharmacy ever. Cannot safely handle the volume of weekly scripts. 
CVS Health,Store Manager in Training,1,Started as a cashier and worked my way up. It Never got better. District managers do not care about their employees . Raises are horrible even if you are a top performer.
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,5,I learned a lot this job about different medications it was very helpful for my future career in healthcare. Can be very busy at times and not busy at other times 
CVS Health,Pharmacy Technician,2,"if you werent on the good side of the more established pharm techs or even pharmacists, you would be stuck in the more front end positions constantly. couldn't do anything about it, pharmacists would just talk down to you"
CVS Health,CSR - Customer Service Representative,3,"The staff handles the covid shots with grace, friendliness, humor and efficiency. I what could have been a difficult experience was a pleasure instead. Well done CVS "
CVS Health,Customer Service Representative,5,"Love my job here!!!!!! Coworkers always understanding, supportive supervisors and management. Work life balance is easy to handle. Flexible scheduling "
CVS Health,Shift supervisor trainee,5,"The working culture, the management and the company employees promotional opportunities along with working with heterogeneous team members im very excited to be part of this company "
CVS Health,Warehouse Stocker,1,CVS Distribution doesn’t promote mental health inside the facility. It falsely advertises a sense of family when in reality you have to deal with ungodly gossip and rumors among management and otherwise. The workload is unbalanced between shifts and the pay is disproportionate to the work being done. I don’t recommend anyone working there when other options are available. 
CVS Health,Certified Pharmacy Technician,1,No training just throw you into it . Don't inform you about training other locations. Computer system is awful.. need to update computer system and training new employees 
CVS Health,Customer Service Representative,3,Store management was nice but corporate often had unreasonable expectations. For example corporate would push you to make people use self checkouts instead of letting you use this register which would really upset customers. Corporate would push things that doesn’t make sense because they weren’t the ones dealing with it. 
CVS Health,RN Case Manager,1,"Case loads are not reasonable at all.   High stress every day!  Recruiters did not present accurate picture of position.   Biggest concern is policies, some which don’t make sense….no room for suggestions for efficiency.   Was told retention rate was 29%. (By a manager)"
CVS Health,Technician,5,Loved getting to know my patients though staffing can use some work. Communication with pharmacist can make or break your day. Management is hit or miss
CVS Health,Store Manager,3,"You have to be ready to work long days when store hours are cut or if hiring is moving slow. Fun if you like to do a lot and learn the basics of managing in retail fast and efficiently. Just make sure to have a good team in your store and a good district team, or else you'll be working 70 hours on a 45hr salary. "
CVS Health,Order Selector,5,Hard work make the dream work. It is a Monday through Friday 2pm to11 with some Saturdays when asked for the overtime when the company has to make the quota.
UnitedHealth Group,Advocate4Me Representative,5,"I truly feel blessed to be able to work with such amazing and supportive people. Truly amazing caring individuals, sure there are a few not so great but literally over 90% of the workforce and the company's culture  I've interacted with has been just amazing, I've been with the company for one year and a half. Highly recommend this company for anyone who is looking for a solid career with advancement."
UnitedHealth Group,Community Health Worker,2,Management was absolutely in it  for themselves. Constant changing policies. Work overload! Unsafe policies regarding field visits and did I say extreme caseload ?  Very unsupportive Company that completely is focused on metrics and numbers.. Advancement next to none. I would work here again only if my children were starving.. Please know that I had it excellent reviews. I’m not a disgruntled employee. I’m just saying the truth.
UnitedHealth Group,Senior Customer Service Representative,4,Loved my Job and unfortunately I was let go for  not hitting goal . I was there for almosy 3 years and hit goal consistently. A mixture of me trusting my super would do their job and get it right and me not vocalizing what was going on just messed me up towards the end and that was that. I miss it so very much.
UnitedHealth Group,Nurse,5,"Wonderful place. Nice people would recommend to anyone work from home, flexible  . Great place for a nurse to start or get comfortable able and  stay. "
UnitedHealth Group,Collection Representative,4,"Permanent wfh set up as long as you a hit the daily target and your metrics are good. What I hated is the dispute for OT pays, and sometimes the Internet Allowance"
UnitedHealth Group,Customer Advocate,4,I loved the job but training was very fast paced.  My trainer was awesome but there are so many new systems and terminology to learn.  Be prepared to take notes and study after work hours.
UnitedHealth Group,Claims Processor,5,I really enjoyed my time at UHG they really care about their employees. Metrics are extremely reasonable the managers are always willing to help. Lots of opportunities for growth
UnitedHealth Group,Analyst-Workforce Management ,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Working at home.  My boss was a disgraceful.I had to sue and win. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?My boss. unfair, disappointed and discrimination What is the work environment and culture like at the company?toxic at best.   Unfriendly, disrespectful and not a teaching environment.  What is a typical day like for you at the company?Hostile,  Excretion,  Long, Long"
UnitedHealth Group,Care Navigator,5,"Working here has been great, I have been able to gain skills and learn new things. I work under a manager that does not micro-manage and a typical day is talking to members and helping them get the information they need to move forward."
UnitedHealth Group,RN Case Manager,5,Wonderful place to work. My manager was amazing. I loved being able to make a difference in my members lives through support and education . I was on a very supportive team. 
UnitedHealth Group,Customer Service Representative,4,"The pay is good. However, it is so stressful. Calls are back to back other agents and managers don’t help either. Also, it’s so hard to move up or ask for a raise. "
UnitedHealth Group,Care Navigator,3,"I was a CN for two and a half years. When I first started in the role, it was pretty simple and less overwhelming. Of course over the years there were a lot of changes and it made the job feel overwhelming. Too strict with metrics & they MICROMANAGE!! We’re literally taking calls all day with little to no breaks . The pay was trash! For all that they require from us CNs to do the pay didn’t match up! Applying for internal jobs was a nightmare as well. They say there’s room for growth but that’s complete BS. I’ve applied to over 200+ internal jobs & got rejected over and over! The only good thing about the role is that it’s 100% remote & they do have great employee benefits. Other than that, I would NOT recommend this job to anyone unless you enjoy being on calls 24/7 and micromanaged. "
UnitedHealth Group,Pharmacy Care Coordinator,5,"The company has had several changes since I have been employed with them but what company doesn’t go thru changes. Nice place to work, I have been blessed with some sups that’s been above amazing to work with."
UnitedHealth Group,Business Analyst,5,This was my first corporate job that felt like home. Their culture is amazing and the pay is good. Leadership is full of encouragement and understanding without losing sight of directorial prowess. My co workers and I are truly a work family. My forever job

UnitedHealth Group,DTC Sales Medicare Division,5,"I am new to UHC. As a DTC Sales, I absolutely love my job. Yes my job is to get sales but the time and effort my management trains me to go the extra mile to help seniors make the right choice. It's not all about getting the sale, it's about the quality interaction not only to close the sale but to keep our members as part of our UHC family. Each member is treated as if it was my mother or father or grandparents. That's why I love working here. "
UnitedHealth Group,Account Manager,4,Very good company to work for. Been with the company for 4 years. No work life balance and plan for burnout employees. Overall the benefits package is good.

UnitedHealth Group,Coding Quality Analyst,2,"Unfortunately a majority of the jobs here are or will be sent overseas.  The days are spent training of the overseas personnel and covering positions above your pay grade while we wait to be laid off.  Quality work and commitment will not get you anything with uhg, because the jobs will be overseas.  They will however use your skills to the last bit. "
UnitedHealth Group,Registered Nurse Case Manager,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Flexible schedule and good pay What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management and their expectations! It didn’t matter what you were accomplishing with mbrs just so you meet metrics. You could make several calls a day with really no quality but to give the quality they want for the mbrs you won’t meet metrics  management is friends with their manager and neve getting checked. Weeding out good employees to keep their “friends” a job! What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Worst management ever! And the pitiful fact is no one checks KVP on her behaviors!!! What is a typical day like for you at the company?Hectic and calls all day like a robot
UnitedHealth Group,Project Manager – National Quality and Network Management,4,"A typical day at work involves managing multiple healthcare projects, coordinating with teams, and ensuring compliance with federal/state requirements. I’ve learned a great deal about project prioritization, adaptability, and stakeholder communication. Management encourages autonomy but is supportive when needed. The workplace culture fosters collaboration and continuous learning. The hardest part of the job is balancing competing priorities and deadlines. The most enjoyable part is successfully delivering projects that directly improve healthcare services for veterans and their families. The sense of purpose keeps me motivated."

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Everything besides working from home. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?They are really focused on metrics more than quality.

Truly amazing caring individuals, sure there are a few not so great but literally over 90% of the workforce and the company's culture  I've interacted with has been just amazing, I've been with the company for one year and a half. Highly recommend this company for anyone who is looking for a solid career with advancement."

UnitedHealth Group,Inbound Coordinator,4,Management is OK....Only one Supervisor micromanage. Pay isn't the best but it all depends on your Supervisor!! Some supervisors give grace while others use this as their opportunity to demise an employee.
UnitedHealth Group,Advocate4Me Representative,4,Loved the team I was on but calls are back to back with little downtime in between. Lots of screens to toggle back and forth to. Lots of tech problems. Overall not a bad job if you can get past training as of 10 ppl only 3 stayed past training. 
UnitedHealth Group,Bilingual (English/Mandarin/Cantonese) Care Navigator,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Good culture, good managers.

UnitedHealth Group,Senior Director,3,"Being part of a massive org like UHG takes some getting used to. I'm totally behind it's mission and am inspired by where the company is headed. But it's a huge company with lots of deep roots to pull up to make meaningful change happen. But, it's happening, and that's promising."
UnitedHealth Group,Capability Analyst,2,Probably the least toxic environment day to day but you are expendable. Projects people have worked on for years can be scrapped and you can be laid off at anytime. You and your department can have anything random thrown onto your plate or reassigned at anytime time. It's a very sink or swim company and I was told and experienced multiple times that people are thrown into things with no training or prep and just expected to figure it out. People thrown into product owner positions with no prior relevant experience for example. 
UnitedHealth Group,Provider Data Analyst,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The best part is I work from home and they cover IVFWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The idke /lock time, quality goals, deadlines are all unrealistic and they micromanage you to the TWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Morale is super low everyone is overworked and stressed What is a typical day like for you at the company?Log on and work all day only leave desk for lunch/breaks.."
UnitedHealth Group,Case Manager,5,"Good company to work for, can be stressful at times but overall the work environment is positive. The patients have complex medical issues, but with the help of the interdisciplinary teams, helping patients is not a problem.  "
UnitedHealth Group,Billing Specialist,1,Trainer played music all day long while I was trying to learn and do test cases. It was frustrating to say the least. I resigned shortly after I started. 
UnitedHealth Group,Provider Advocate,5,"I love my job at UHC. My managers are very accepting and helpful with any questions that I may have, there is never a time that I have needed help and not recieved it"
UnitedHealth Group,Community Health Worker,1,They can say it's not a call center but that's a lie. They harp on you about productivity for calls no matter the position. There is not very much room for growth in my opinion. If you don't feel ready after training they don't care. If you make mistakes and are actively fixing them it doesn't matter. 
UnitedHealth Group,Advocate4Me Representative,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits and using my education What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Back to back calls and metricsWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work environment is call center and culture is for all people and racesWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy and fulfilling with lots of special team members answering and educating the reps
UnitedHealth Group,Manager,4,Not a bad place to work. Depends on your department. Some departments have more freedom in work life balance than others do. Overall it was not a terrible experience working there.
UnitedHealth Group,Clinical Transformation Director,4,"The company offered a high degree of flexibility, a culture and value system that fully aligned with my personal values.  I felt a sense of belonging."
UnitedHealth Group,Triage Nurse,3,"Moved to call center style, work became less autonomous and more scripted and metrics driven. Members received so many calls from multiple overlapping departments so they were often upset to get another call."
UnitedHealth Group,Provider Service Representative,3,"To be blunt, I had a nervous breakdown doing this job. Provider Services. It was not the call center environment that bothered me. It was 13 years of telling people in excruciating pain their relief injections were denied. Telling the elderly they had a $6,000 bill they had to satisfy United's $10,000 deductible before any coverage would be ""Considered"" not covered, ""Considered"". If you have an emotional shield and things like that don't bother you, you will be fine in this position. My biggest issue was they were not willing to find me a new position, such as the claims department. Per ADA requirements they were, by law, required to find me another position. United Healthcare will find you a position that you are not qualified for and make you apply for it as if you were just walking in off the street. The only good thing I can say about the company is the work from home ability. "
UnitedHealth Group,Customer Service Representative,4,Great they really care about employees and one of the best places I’ve worked.  The phone calls were high volume but they train you so you can be prepared
UnitedHealth Group,Bilingual Broker Services Specialty,1,You interview 3 to 5 times to land a stressful and underpaid job. They used to subtract bathroom break from actual breaks.  Terribleexperience working there.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Sometimes had to work long hours. It was a contract job, so not knowing if you will have a job.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It was kind of hard working from home, not being able to bounce ideas off another co worker that is close by. Can message others and hope they will answer soon.What is a typical day like for you at the company?It was a call center,  so answering calls making sure you hit all your points,  in case the call gets graded. So you end up with a good scores.  Possibly get a bonus later depending on your scores."
UnitedHealth Group,Advocate4Me Representative,5,"I truly feel blessed to be able to work with such amazing and supportive people. Truly amazing caring individuals, sure there are a few not so great but literally over 90% of the workforce and the company's culture  I've interacted with has been just amazing, I've been with the company for one year and a half. Highly recommend this company for anyone who is looking for a solid career with advancement."
UnitedHealth Group,Case Manager,4,"Great work life balance, mangers could be better at communicating. Training and onboarding are great. I wish I would have never left but had personal issues. Great company "
UnitedHealth Group,Senior Community Care,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Fair compensation for work completed.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?It often feels you are being micromanaged and dictated what to do and how to treat your patients.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Deceitful, stressful from your own team and facilities.  Constantly needing to make certain orders given are correct and carried out."
UnitedHealth Group,Medical Technician / Clerk,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?The employees you work aside. Management is sneaky. Always looking for away to hold you back and cut your raises. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Trying to find work ti do when medicine production is slow. They make is hard to check emails, then bother you about it when your behind.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Hostile for none management Employees. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Fast when there's work to be done. Restless when there no work."
UnitedHealth Group,Network Contract Manager,1,Very high turnover rate. No respect for work/life balance. Company culture is a problem. The benefits are good. While compensation is good bonuses are not. 
UnitedHealth Group,LVN,5,Great place to work. Good work life balance.  They care about being inclusive. The encourage employees to take time off. There is constant growth in the company.
UnitedHealth Group,Remote Medicare Claims Processor,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits are great, but not worth the micromanagement and stress.  They could have offered me twice as much and I still would have quit.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Micro management and ineffective managersWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Horrible.  They preach about honesty, but when you are honest, they accuse you of being aggressive and negative.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Disorganization, constant change in rules and expectations"
UnitedHealth Group,Electronic Data Manager,1,"Co-workers were great, but the company itself doesn't care about it's workers.  They are farming everything they possibility can to India and the Philippines.  No security for Americans."
UnitedHealth Group,Customer Service Advocate,2,"Working remotely at United Healthcare can be challenging due to communication barriers, limited support, and difficulties in maintaining work-life balance. The lack of in-person interaction can lead to feelings of isolation, and navigating complex systems without direct access to colleagues or management can be frustrating. Additionally, the high expectations and workload can feel overwhelming without the immediate support or camaraderie found in an office setting. Despite the flexibility of remote work, the lack of structured collaboration and feedback can hinder professional growth and job satisfaction."
UnitedHealth Group,Team Leader/Supervisor,4,Environment taught me quite a bit about working in utilization review.  Teammates and supervisors were supportive and communicated really well.  Everyone understood that we were there to help vulnerable perspns in need and did the best that they could within their respective rolws to support them.
UnitedHealth Group,RN Case Manager,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?They are an inclusive company and recognize the contributions of all its employees. There are many oppurtunities for advancement or to event change lanes  within the company with mentoring programs and advanced education oppurtunities available to all employees.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Need to work to meet the metrics set by the company based on industry and government requirements. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very inclusive company. We do have offices around the world. Many work oppurtunities are work from home or a hybrid office work  and from home depending job reqirements.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I am a virtual outreach nurse. I outreach to members to work on medication adherence, health screenings and as a resource to try to help them navigate the healthcare landscape."
UnitedHealth Group,LCSW Therapist,4,Nice place to work with a wide variety of persons in need. Administration can be a little slow to respond to requests for items like desks and printers. IT dept is awesome and responsive.
UnitedHealth Group,Medical Assistant,4,They provide all the equipment they have great benefits they have great managers and staff. You just have to get into a good area and make sure it's an area that does not lay off easily
UnitedHealth Group,Claims Processor,4,"This a great company to work for if you’re looking for stable long term employment,  and an amazing benefits package.  They also offer the option of doing remote work for certain positions. "
UnitedHealth Group,Previsit care coordinator,4,This department is fairly new so it is very micro managed they also just laid some managers off and it’s always constant changes. I wouldn’t work in this department in the future
UnitedHealth Group,Sales Representative,5,"Love the team I work on, there’s a great culture and work environment. I spend most days talking with field agents selling Medicare advantage and PDP plans."
UnitedHealth Group,CSR - Customer Service Representative,3,Nice place to work from home not much more to say. Pay could be better alot of work with little compensation. PTO and time off is great no micro managing 
UnitedHealth Group,NP-C,3,The member visits aren’t scheduled in an order that makes sense so you spend a lot of time driving.  A lot of task you have to do on your own time …so you def will work much more than your commitment. Bonuses? Metrics are very hard to meet. Employee health insurance plan is terrible. I’ve never paid as much  out of pocket as I have since being with UHG. 
UnitedHealth Group, Associate,1,"Only work here if you like micromanaging, favoritism, high school cliques, not being treated like a person but  a work horse, doing the work of 2 people, overpriced food, no vending machines, equipment always breaking, quotas, no bonus or raises with the occasional downsizing and being treated like ""family"""
UnitedHealth Group,Customer Service Representative,4,"I really enjoyed my time at UHG. I was able to gain a ton of experience. The customers can be quite difficult and things can sometimes be unclear. Overall, I would recommend this company. "
UnitedHealth Group,Senior Customer Service Representative,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?You earn a paycheck every 2 weeks. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?You can expect to get fired for things that you can’t control. If the provider is not happy because they are not paying the claims it counts against your performance.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Feels like a club and you’re not invitedWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Trying to make people and especially providers that eventough we are not paying you for your services, waiting for months for someone to call you back or denying your clams for any made up reason, they are to be happy and give a 10 on the survey."
UnitedHealth Group,Advocate4Me Representative,5,"I truly feel blessed to be able to work with such amazing and supportive people. Truly amazing caring individuals, sure there are a few not so great but literally over 90% of the workforce and the company's culture  I've interacted with has been just amazing, I've been with the company for one year and a half.

UnitedHealth Group,QA Supervisor,3,"I don’t enjoyed my job, but it for sure was a corporation. They are here to make money.  I appreciated the structure, but disliked the lack of ability to move up in the company. "
UnitedHealth Group,Customer Service Agent,5,What is the best thing to work in the company? Training and encouragement and good atmosphere What is the most stressful of working in the company? The metrics and many supervisors are too much.That calls are answered. How is the environment and culture of work in the company? Well with a lot
UnitedHealth Group,Claims Processor,2,"The company advertises a very lucrative pay rate in job postings, but is not willing to actually pay on the higher end. We are expected to meet metrics, are given a pat on the back for doing so, but not compensated for it. We are paid so little that the high deductible insurance plan is really the only option and it’s nearly impossible to meet. You will receive invites to join the CEO’s “fireside chats” which is a complete insult to UNDERPAID employees. Maybe he should take a slight pay cut so that they could afford to pay their employees decent wages. I came to this company because they sold me a dream, but realistically destroyed me financially to the point where I can’t even leave. I wake up every morning dreading logging on to the computer because I know that my time is invaluable to them. Unless you’re a college student living in your moms basement keep searching, there are far better opportunities out there than this place. They should honestly be ashamed of themselves for being such a massive corporation, but not caring about their employees financial wellness. On a brighter note, coaches and supervisors are pretty supportive so you do have someone to hold your hand while you cry about how depressed the job has made you! "
UnitedHealth Group,Care Navigator,2,"I started working here in 2022 and it’s now 2024. My role at UHC has changed dramatically. They want you to be adaptable but they push your limits. We have so much on our plates as Care Navigators, it’s unreal. Moving to a different department is almost impossible. I’ve applied to over 20 jobs trying to get out of care navigation and always get shut down. Raises depend on work performance. They are very strict on metrics. They value quantity over quality. All they really care about is how many calls you make per hour. They don’t really care about what’s being talked about on the phone with your members. They have you work out of different dialers everyday, so you unfortunately fall behind on your tasks. I don’t recommend working here at all. I could go on and on.  It feels like the sunken place and I can’t get out."
UnitedHealth Group,Intern,3,Amazing people at UHG. The work environment is great. Every one supports one another and you make connections that will last you a lifetime. I would recommend the internship to a friend!
UnitedHealth Group,Senior Data Consultant,4,Many talented employees who are collaborative and professional.  Large company with many siloed departments navigating new infastructure.  Good leadership and access to technology. 
UnitedHealth Group,Application Delivery Owner,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Technology and innovation.  Benefits are also very good.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Fear of job moving offshore.  A lot of IT jobs were being shifted to the global market.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very employee positive with deep concerns about employee wellbeing.
UnitedHealth Group,Retention Specialist,2,3 different businesses managers in less that 6 mths. Lack of communication. This job was fine at first then went downhill quickly. Wfh is the o Lu advantage 
UnitedHealth Group,Client Services Manager,1,"Lots of fluff and no real promises kept. Lots of layoffs. Not secure. Need new management practices to be in place and extensive training. Long hours, discrimination, and toxic environment. "
UnitedHealth Group,Clinical Recruiter,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Nothing good about it. Huge company with no soul What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Knowing you are dispensable and wondering if you’ll have a job tomorrowWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very politically correct and lots of people promoted into decision making positions that don’t belong there What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy, depends upon what your job is"
UnitedHealth Group,Remote,5,"I would answer hundreds of calls a day as an advocate in Medicare and retirement. Had to know everything medical dental vision otc behavioral health hearing prescription benefits etc overall benefit knowledge. Check claims, do appeals, grievances. Work with all other departments to meet members needs. All while meeting metrics in many categories and aiming for good call reviews as the quarterly bonuses are based on those. Very active teams chat. Very strict on schedule adherence. Two 15 min breaks and a 30 min lunch. Good benefits. It is so hard to change positions that was my biggest complaint. "
UnitedHealth Group,Appeals and Grievance Coordinator,3,Work life balance is great. A lot of flexibility however the pay is horrible and management is always changing. Raises are horrible. CEO get bonuses. 
UnitedHealth Group,Care Coordinator,5,Great company caring co workers . Good management . I enjoyed  my time there working it was a good experience . The hours changed but the company overall was good 
UnitedHealth Group,Senior Pharmacy Care Technician ,1,I honestly hate this job. I know that sounds harsh. Having to call to question members on why they aren’t taking their medications is stressful and half the time they don’t want to speak to you because UHC has 3-5 other departments calling the same people asking the sane questions especially so by the time you call they’re annoyed.. I don’t blame them. All management cares about is numbers and metrics. If you don’t meet that then you’re punished by coming into the office. Yes this is a WFH position mainly but honestly I rather be back working any of my old jobs than working here. Overall if you like being on the phone snd bothering elderly people then maybe this job is for you but if you don’t stay clear from here. I wish I would’ve read the reviews before I accepted this position. Honestly hoping to be fired soon. I wake up everyday filled with stress and anxiety about this job. 
UnitedHealth Group,Administrative Assistant,3,"Management lacking, unrealistic metrics, micromanaging. Pay is very low compare to  other companies. Best thing about the company is the time off, insurance could be better "

UnitedHealth Group,House Calls Nurse Practitioner,1,"Management and corporate systems do not support or respect clinical providers. If a patient cancels, it’s the provider’s metrics (and compensation) that suffers.  The scheduling system is a robot with no understanding that human beings have to find parking, walk from the car to the patient apartment, have an occasional sip of water, and use the bathroom! There are no breaks. For instance you are expected to see 4 patients in 4 hours with over a hour driving in between patients. Charting (19 pages per patient) is done on your own time. Ordering supplies also is done on your own time. Calling patients the day before your visit is (wait for it) done on your own time. Managers are incompetent and MEAN; they tell you to read the policy versus being collegial and having a conversation. And there are hundreds of policies that change constantly… Training is basically nonexistent. You teach yourself everything and of course on your own time.  IT is not based in this hemisphere, so you can expect return calls at 3am, and you are expected to take these calls. So you are on your own unless your manager gets in trouble for some breach in protocol, then you will get verbally reprimanded. And reprimands are the only actual contact you have with anyone in the company—you have no coworkers, there is no HR, and forget about administrative  staff. It’s all you. The patients are mostly OK.  But any interaction with the company will be negative and it will ruin your day. "
UnitedHealth Group,Patient Care Coordinator,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?When I quit. The only part I liked was the supervisor I worked under.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Being lied to constantly and the mandatory overtime for an entire yearWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Hostile some days, favortism, lack of advancement to opportunities as promised.What is a typical day like for you at the company?100% of my schedule was spent on the phones assisting customers. Spearheaded some projects."
UnitedHealth Group,Biological Sales Rep,3,"Senior leadership would not take action on operational short comings and to see patients being hospitalized because of the ineptitude of the reauthorization process and incredible lack of accountability was and ignored by senior leadership.  The response was ""I don't want to hear excuses or the issues with our operational short comings."""
ExxonMobil,Assistant Manager,4,"great place to work, good pay, friendly teams. but that was a long time ago I dont know what its like now."
ExxonMobil,Intern,3,"smart colleagues, never ending learning here. However depending on your luck you might be spending a big chunk of your time to work on something useless (usually required by the site you're supporting // some managers to help to survive the yearly assessment( "
ExxonMobil,Process Technician,1,Workplace culture is very toxic. I ended up on anxiety meds 7months in. Poor work/life balance. Overtime is the only way to make above average money. Overall I think it can be a good company to work at if you end up in the right unit around the right people.
ExxonMobil,Manufacturing Process Engineer,4,Great place to learn as a beginner. Salary is not competitive. Performance assessment is relative and leads to cutthroat corporate culture. Management is not the best
ExxonMobil,Operator,2,Good place to start a career. Easy place to work with supervisors telling you what to do and when to do and how to do it. No Chance of making a mistake that way!
ExxonMobil,Analyst,3,Good company great management friendly staff a good place to learn nd grown. Lots of ad hoc outside work employees engagementGenerally good place to work 
ExxonMobil,Engineer,3,"Treat you good if you know the game. Demoralizing for others. Everyone wants to quit. We all like our team but feel like upper management is lost. If you keep positive morale, it is fine."
ExxonMobil,Business Analyst,5,"Pros: Company to retire with, good work culture and flexibility. Cons:Career transition takes time. Depends on team and manager. Overall good to work with "
ExxonMobil,Chef opérateur,3,"Very open career development, comfortable salary but a direction which does not know how to communicate and which shows that it has little respect for its employees.Damage."
ExxonMobil,Planner,4,Great company to work for. Excellent pay and benefits. Management is a bit on the micromanager side at times.                                                        
ExxonMobil,Advanced Reservoir Engineer,1,No process established for controlling supervisor powers over employees careers. One bad supervisor could change your career path for next 5 years……..
ExxonMobil,Cashier,5,"Working as a cashier at Exxon gas station was a rewarding experience. I enjoyed interacting with a diverse range of customers, developing my communication and problem-solving skills. It was fast-paced and required me to stay organized and attentive, which helped me improve my multitasking abilities. I also appreciated the opportunity to learn about managing transactions and handling financial responsibilities. The role gave me a sense of accountability and helped me develop a strong work ethic, both of which are valuable skills I’ll carry forward in future positions."
ExxonMobil,Mine Equipment Reliability Engineer / Shovels,1,Management is no good. people are lost. Performance review system is not fair.laid off many employees during covidno job stability. Site employees are gangs
ExxonMobil,Engineer,2,Relationship dynamics is unbalanced. Everyone is not treated fairly and equally. Management and Ops are too empowered to determine your fate in the company.  People skills are more important than technical skill in the company.
ExxonMobil,Senior System Analyst,3,"You can find out more about your ExxonMobil Healthcare, Pension and 401K benefits if you Google ""AT&T The Retirement Group"". There are many interesting articles. "
ExxonMobil,Engineer,2,"Great entry pay for campus new hires and abundant opportunities to learn/develop skills in first few years but technical careers have a quick decline at ~5 years in.  The trend of role consolidations and off shoring for the past 5 years or so has led to excessive work hours being demanded in exchange for fewer and fewer opportunities to advance. You have more ""base"" work than ever but with the performance ranking system, you have to work more hours to out-compete your peers and stay employed/advancing. If you get sick, injured, have a death or birth in the family - expect your rank to fall. There is no grace. Your output will still be compared to peers that were there year round. And management may say increased workload is temporary but if you pull it off (which you must if you want a raise/opportunity the next year) then you're proving that it's possible for one person to do the work and they'll leave it that way until someone in the role reaches their breaking point, their rank falls, they quit/are let go, and THEN management will split it back into two roles. Again, if you're young, healthy & want to save/learn a lot - work here. If you're an experienced hire, you'll see discrimination (jobs I've had frequently ""required"" twice the number of years from external companies before hiring teams deemed someone qualified). Either way, go in with an exit strategy. Three years= vested in 401k, 5 years= vested in pension. "

Berkshire Hathaway,Accounting Assistant,4,"Great pay, bonus plan and support. (varies by industry .. Ins, Automobile, Real Estate etc..) Wonderful opportunity for advancement as long as you are committed to their culture and moving up in the food chain with no attachments such as a family!Work and home balance is difficult however rewarding. "
Berkshire Hathaway, Professional Operator,5,"Customer service is my forte.  I enjoyed every call.  We were first contact with the company and  I enjoyed my work thoroughly from start to finish.  I had helpful supervisors and peers.  We did back office work between calls.  There were exercise areas which I never used so I can't give details on them.  The interior of the area was not visible from the hall.The interior of the area were not visible from the hall.We had places to rest on our breaks and one hour lunch periods.  I usually napped at lunch time though there was a TV in our break room.The only part of my job I didn't care for was the ""statutory manditory overtime"" when we had large outages.  I really have no complaints against the company.  I was successful at one call resolutions.  The main thing I practiced that made me successful was the tempo of the call is set by the operators attitude when they first speak to the customer.  Treat them with respect and as you would want to be treated.  Resolve their issues with one call or explain what needs to happen and how they will know when their resolution is complete."
Berkshire Hathaway,IT Manager,1,"Poor management, lack of direction, unequal performance management. Mistakes and lack of achieving goals are swept under the rug for favorite teacher's pet employees.Best to steer clear."
Berkshire Hathaway,Rebel without a cause,2,"Most of the people are great! The leadership in technical services should not be in their roles and should be replaced with fresh ideas, energy , and leaders who practice modern leadership styles! I think they climbed the ladder to the top so they can say they have a fancy title but you never see them and they do nothing to improve working conditions, raise salaries, or properly develop employees. Every quarter they move people around to play with the budget. They put people in roles they don't want to be in just to adjust opex/capex to make their quarterly numbers. Everyone is unhappy!!! Old command and control styles, their processes are ridiculous and a bad version of agile. They need a complete restructuring and new leadership!"
Berkshire Hathaway,Real Estate Broker,5,"Great ways to learn about aspects in this industry. Many more people think it is nice, too. I have been a real estate broker for 25 years and hope I can continue to work in this great job."
Berkshire Hathaway,"Crothersville, IN",3,The work and hours are demanding. Pay is not competitive. It's difficult to take an unscheduled break. Should consider work/life balance for all employees.
Berkshire Hathaway,Property Manager,2,"While Berkshire Hathaway is a wonderful company, their sister company (American Hertiage Property Management) was not a place I would ever recommend to someone looking for property management. I was told that turn over rate was low, but 3 people quit before I got there. Work life balance was never established. The bonus structure was laughable, there was no training, no supervision (unless you're doing something wrong); after a month of me being there, my supervisor told me "" You have to earn your salary here because we aren't making enough money and we can't afford to keep you unless you sign on more property owners to rent from.""I was told that my position was to advertise and to manage properties. No advertising tools, plans, or instructions were given to me and when I asked for them, I was never met with a response. I was also told that I wouldn't receive more than 40 properties so that I could advertise properly at the same time. I had over 50 properties before I left. Lastly, inwas told that I wouldn't have any properties that were run down or needed a lot of work. When over 15 of those kinds of properties were assigned to me, the response was "" Well, you know I could've given you more of them"".You will work so much harder than you need to in order to keep your job and nothing that my supervisor said was true. If you have a family, don't even think about applying. "
Berkshire Hathaway,Sales Agent,5,I enjoyed my time at Berkshire Hathaway as the management is very receptive to your needs and is always willing to answer your questions and help with your career 
Berkshire Hathaway,Licensed Realtor,5,"Working at Berkshire Hathaway has truly been a fulfilling experience.everyone is super nice and helpful, the company values you as a person and provides you with a sense of belonging"
Berkshire Hathaway,Recruiter,1,"There is no training provided. NFM does not have a training department therefore, training is left to employees who have zero experience in training, are overwhelmed with high stress levels and no time resulting in extremely high turnover. The stress has negatively affected employees health resulting in major absenteeism.  There is virtually no support. Management is unavailable and lacks skills needed for successfully managing  a team. Defaults to using threats and fear tactics. Lacks any semblance of kindness or compassion.  "
Berkshire Hathaway,Front Desk Receptionist,5,"Great place to work. Good management, friendly atmosphere. It a nice environment to work in. Team is inclusive and gives off a family environment type vibe."
Berkshire Hathaway,Sales Associate,5,Amazingly supportive management and training. Fantastic tech platform. Kind and helpful teammates. Nice market and low pressure. Nice weekly tools and sales meetings to stay on track. 
Berkshire Hathaway,Workers Compensation Claims Adjuster,5,"I am a WC claims adjuster and honestly this has been one of the best companies I've work for. We are fully supported and trained so well in every aspect of claims. Management is amazing and teams are small enough so everyone gets weekly mentoring/ meetings for and questions or reviews. This was one of my favorite parts because as I was developing in the career I had a lot of questions. Coworkers were cool, no drama ever. The office would regularly give out a ton of gifts and goodies. Office lunches are a regular thing, potlucks, company outings, holiday parties and birthdays too. Oh and even though I had a full caseload, I rarely felt stressed out because of all the help I knew I had. "
Berkshire Hathaway,Marketing Assistant,2,Real estate jobs are a strange animal.   Unless you want to be a realtor. Then just get your license. There’s no working your way up. And I saw no loyalty. Everyone just out for themselves. 
Berkshire Hathaway,Sales/Marketing Consultant,5,Great company just not enough diversity for me. Depending on what city you are in the demographic may be different but i just wasn’t the best vibe for me and then you have to deal with the politics

Berkshire Hathaway,Workers Compensation Claims Adjuster,3,Toxic environment. Felt unprepared and undertrained. Asked for help and managers seemed annoyed. Frustrating and sad a lot. No support from staff in my opinion
Berkshire Hathaway,Cadillac internet sales,1,"84 hr work week. If you do not make pay plan you get $1,500 for 336hrs that's $4.46 per hour. They find ways around the minimum wage law trust me. They promise the moon and do not deliver a single thing. We ended up in cubicles we had to find parts to and bring our own laptop then go and get customer records from the office ourselves and create our own call list. We had no one even talk to our entire class for the first two weeks. We just wandered around trying to find a space we could set up in and supplies. They wanted us to make 10 appointments a day or you could not go home. You could not be out on the floor selling unless you had those 10 appointments. They would constantly call in another friend of theirs to close your deal when it was clear they did not need to and take half or all of your commission. We had to keep real good track of our pay because they would try and shot us every check."
Berkshire Hathaway,Realtor,4,"I’m not in the office much at all. I work remotely from home and out in the public.

Berkshire Hathaway,Assistant Manager,1,"Owner was very respectful. But if you're not Chinese, don't bother working for them. They will always leave you out. During the end of my work, the owner's wife decided she wanted to come to work and watch the girl employees, she clearly has a lack of self confidence and she wanted to make sure she was on top of everything, and I mean everything! Totally annoying lady. They're also very stingy, they make hundreds of thousands and are unwilling to pay a decent salary."
Berkshire Hathaway,Realtor,4,"Berkshire Hathaway is a great company with an excellent workplace culture and management.  Real estate, however, is not easy to get started when you are accustomed to salary and benefits commensurate with talent and effort."
Berkshire Hathaway,Realtor,5,Great company with focus on training and resources to help in training and being successful in the real estate role and industry. Will return to work here when the time is right

Berkshire Hathaway,HIGHER EDUCATION ACCOUNT REPRESENTATIVE,3,I mostly enjoyed the training that has helped me grow in my sales career. They invest in training you but could do better in allowing you to use the tools they give you.  My last year so many changes happened and management team was very poor willing to throw you under the bus instead of taking ownership of there mistakes. I hope they fixed these issues .. I use to love working there.
Berkshire Hathaway,GIS Technician,2,"Company provides little chance for advancement and no incentive for going above and beyond your remit, preferring to keep employees on the poverty line basic pay-scale for anyone not involved in Field Operations."
Berkshire Hathaway,ACCOUNTANT,3,"There's a wonderful work place culture, but its a hard place to work. There is a lot of work to accomplish each day. the company is an industry leader.

I was also impressed with the founders' backgrounds and the current financial statements."
Berkshire Hathaway,Marketing Manager,4,I started off as intern and worked up to marketing manger. Definitely an environment where everyone wants you to grow and do better. The pay wasn't the best for the desired amount of work and dedication a job like that takes.

Berkshire Hathaway,AP/Purchasing Clerk,5,"Benefits were very good! I love purchasing, receiving, working with vendors. I enjoy Completing IR, GR and PO creation. Enjoyed price comparison between vendors, finding the best quality for the best price. Also, leading new inventions."
Berkshire Hathaway,IT Technician,1,"They were deceptive from start. Offered me salary much less than what was advertised. Healthcare premiums very expensive, $1500/month.

Turned out managers weren't really there based upon qualifications or experience, but rather just seniority and having been in company for while. So when existing manager left, someone else was found and promoted into that role, regardless if they actually had experience as manager.

Performance reviews were extremely subjective and evaluation criteria were never disclosed upon hiring. A lot of these were made up on spot when reviews were done. If your manager was sick or in bad mood that day, your reviews would be negative."
Berkshire Hathaway,REALTOR,5,"I love my Berkshire Family!

First, to be a sales, to know about what customer need is very important in every business field. We need to provide them excellent customer service, and formal legal issue for customers, and help them to find a suitable house.  
My company offer me a lot of marketing resources to improve my real estate experience. like training class, how to apply new concept into the real world.

Berkshire Hathaway,Product Specialist,3,"It is a great place to make some good money. But the 60+ hours a week work will make you exhausted if you have prior engagements. Work takes up most of your time, but it is great for people who are single/ or have been the business and have adjusted to the schedule. The incentives are great if you hit your bonuses but it is only regularly achieved by a handful of people who the manager favors. Do not get me wrong, you can work hard and achieve that too, but doing that day in day out for 12 hours a day can get tiresome. The company has been good to me but it is just not what I was looking for. You can see it as a personal choice and not the company for anyone willing to put in the work and effort."

We worked on commission and Berkshire Hathaway offered us a very competitive split.  We also had support from  the marketing, legal and compliance departments.

I liked the personal relationships which were developed with clients and staff."
Berkshire Hathaway,Operator,1,"No Benefits as these were stripped during mergers, Pay is appalling and is never addressed, talked to and treated like 5 year olds. Only good thing is the production employees stick together as a team, anyone above the ones at the bottom try to break the bit of team spirit that we do have.

Handling millions of dollars of metal every day and can't afford to get it wrong, and the cleaning staff get more than, the production employees."

McKesson,Pharmacy sales consultant ,5,"Great work culture, management team is proactive on employee survey result, great opportunity to advance your career. Big fortune 7 company. There is always something new in this industry which is fun! "
McKesson,Patient Service Representative,3,It is a great introductory call center job. Training was alright and you get alot of help from supervisors curing calls. Can be stressful since you're talking with patients but nothing out of the ordinary 
McKesson,Material Handler,5,Great atmosphere. I enjoy what I do. Team works with you leaders support you and you’re making a difference day to day. I enjoy the bonus I get based on performance 
McKesson,Warehouse Operative,2,"Shocking work environment, no time for a drink or toilet during 8 hours, very cramped and people don’t even want to help you. No training given and you are expected to hit too many targets. Staff members rude and glaring at you. Very easy application process though "
McKesson,Warehouse Associate,4,Decent company. Probation period last 3 months where you cannot take a day off. I think this is pretty old fashion and should be updated. Stable company that you can build experience at.
McKesson,Material Handler,2,"Company needs to assess management issues. You have a supervisor telling people how to do a job that they don't even know, so there ends up being so much confusion for us, especially when we are new."
McKesson,Driver,5,Friendly management and friendly colleagues. Routes are tough but become easier with more experience. Great environment and access to great services. 
McKesson,Staff Accountant,4,The most important thing is not the amount you spend on a job that you don’t want to do it for you but the amount that you’re going to spend to make up the difference 
McKesson,Material Handler,4,"Management people amazing and helpful. I enjoy my day working in induction to see how busy we are, hardest day if staff short and not possible to finish job in time."
McKesson,Delivery Driver,3,Working with employees as a team effort. Do the best to help others. They have good benefits. Manger or leads help others. Love to work there sometimes help do community service for other companies 
McKesson,Customer Service Representative,3,Working with the company was ok not much to say about it really just a quick job make sure you are applying to something else which you are working here
McKesson,Data Analyst,4,"McKesson provides a supportive workplace with robust healthcare solutions, emphasizing innovation and integrity in its industry practices. a very good place to work."
McKesson,Material Handler/Machine Operator,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great place to work until covid hit. Was lots of incentives an family atmosphere ..What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Maintaining the new set percentage implemented 2003What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very comfortable, everyone helped in the beginning"
McKesson,Quality Assurance Coordinator,5,"McKesson is a great company to work for. They truly care about your well being and taking care of you. They are up front with expectations and job responsibilities. As long as you do your job, they will take care of. Good pay for what you do. "
McKesson,Materials Handler ,1,"Typical day working is just trying to pick orders while trying to make your numbers. You have to hit 95 or get a corrective. Some work don't give credit and managers or some leads won't take care of it and you barely have to time to use the restroom or drink water.I learned that managers and some leads don't care about you.  The managers have no accountability and walk past work like they're allergic to boxes and pallets. Trainer lead doesn't train, just polices people with micromanagement. Worst management I think I have ever seen because they get paid more and don't even do 1% of the work but expect more from us while trying to cut costs.Workplace culture is exploit the handlers and get more value from them. Work them into overtime so they get tire out. Then call in pto so that more work is has to be done by those that can keep coming in. It only took a few lazy leads to make all of the leads look bad. Managers and supervisors just stand around and talk.Hardest part of the job is trying to hit your numbers because the start meetings go long and repeat the same stuff each day. And some work doesn't give you credit.Most enjoyable part is when teams comes together and backs each other up. "
McKesson,Specialists 3,1,What is the best part of working at the company?The hours i work are 4 am to 1230 pmWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The being forced out due to age and years with company - hiring of many foreigners who do not speak any english and less americansWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?It is so so  too.much favoritismWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Go in process returns and work on other odds and ends
McKesson,Customer Service Representative,1,"Personally I wouldn’t recommend this company to anybody .. they use you until they don’t need you anymore and then call you at 11pm at night to let you know you’re no longer needed & won’t even let you finish out the pay period week, they did this to over 100 employees."
McKesson,Lead Material Handler/Trainer,5,We usually have some kind of events where every culture is recognized. Every employee is given the opportunity to participate. Work life balance is important here at Mckesson.  The bigger departments have more than 1 shift which splits the work and avoids working long hours. 
McKesson,Associate Business Analyst,4,"The company is big, we had lot of “org changes” recently, which was good, the old higher management wasn’t responsive at all, new one is pretty good so far. The compensation seems fair but I have had friends with similar experience earning more so there’s that. It could be that I have been here for long so I don’t get the “new hire” rate. Good PTO and Health Plans. "
McKesson,Sales,3,Currently experiencing restructuring. Changes in works and so much uncertainty.  We need to focus on job at hand and hitting goals. Finding out daily who has left. 
McKesson,Product Manager,4,"Excellent company culture and professional development opportunities/training. A large, established corporation is great for job security and career growth, but it can often add bureaucracy and impede innovation/speed to market."
McKesson,Pharmacy sales consultant ,5,"Great work culture, management team is proactive on employee survey result, great opportunity to advance your career. Big fortune 7 company. There is always something new in this industry which is fun! "
McKesson,Material Handler Associate,5,"Working for Mckesson you have the opportunities to make a difference in someone else's life. They are a medical distribution center however in recent events the company is going down slowly due to rising costs of supplies, so currently it's struggling to keep workers. The work life balance is not good because you are required to work overtime and sometimes those shifts can be either 9-10hrs long five days aweek. You do have weekends off which is good but during the week if you have a family you will have to sacrifice time from family. Working here is also stressful because you have to meet company standards, meaning you have to be able to perform over 95% throughout the day which is really physically demanding. Lots of employee's have been cut due to falling short on company standards. Company also has a tendency to over work their employee's due to lack of workers but at the same time don't want to hire more people and if they do hire more people, the new hires don't make the cut due to not achieving over 95%."
McKesson,Material Handler,2,I wouldn’t work here hours are long. Company doesn’t take doctor excuses . Easy to point out with 8 points . 2 points if you call in 1 point if you’re late . No grace period at all . You cannot grow within the company at all . Managers are rude and horrible . More sleeping around on the job than actually working on the job . Very toxic & unclean work environment . 
McKesson,Technical Support Representative,3,"It's never fun to be downsized. Be honest with your people when it's occurring and they'll still work hard for you.  Needless to say, this didn't happen here. "
McKesson,Material Handler/Forklift Operator,3,Corporate McKesson will throw you to the side if you don't fit into their plan anymore. They do layoffs pretty frequently I've noticed but they have compensated for the inconvenience. It shows me that they're willing to sacrifice people's livelihoods in a way to betterment themselves. The warehouse I was working at was actually pretty great and inclusive but that was because the people made it that way. Great company with great benefits but you ultimately at the mercy of the corporate decisions that could affect you negatively and stress you out. And you don't need that in your life so maybe it's best just to stay away.
McKesson,Digital Asset Specialist,3,"Nice amenities in terms of the cafeteria and campus (excellent walking trails).  Overall work culture is not especially appealing in that you will ultimately be doing the work of a B2B e-commerce company that serves as a middleman for medical products, looking to juice profit wherever possible.  If that's your bag, and working in cubicle farms, go for it.  Many of my co-workers had worked there for extended tenures; McKesson did seem to be very flexible around telework and family leave."
McKesson,Program Manager,3,It is ok as all things go. My manager is great and I like my team members and colleagues                   a lot. As with all companies do your diligence before joining.
McKesson,Patient Support Specialist,1,"You are expected to do way too much work for the pay. Low Morale,Management is horrible. It use to be a great place to work until new management took over."
McKesson,Order Selector,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Knowing that you're helping save lives, or at least, prolonging one.   The pay is great, also benefits. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Long hours can be frustrating. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Nice environment,  great meeting new people of different races. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Face paced, trying to reach goals."
McKesson,Team Lead,5,"I enjoyed my time at McKesson. I left for a new opportunity, but would return to the right position. The only concern was the payscale. It was a bit lower than the average for certains roles. Just make sure to do your research before accepting an offer. They do however have great benefits and a great working environment."
McKesson,Day Shift Operations Manager,1,"Management cannot make an unbiased decision or promotion. Pay is below average and work life balance is non existent for everyone. No direction, or planning by upper management leaves the hourly employees to suffer long work days and poor morale. "
McKesson,Biomedical Equipment Technician,2,Upper management (above site manager level) don’t care much about following best procedures and consistently ramp up production quotas for their employees at the medical pump end users expense. 
McKesson,Driver,3,"Great work culture, management team is proactive on employee survey result, great opportunity to advance your career. Big fortune 7 company. There is always something new in this industry which is "
McKesson,Material Handler,3,A lot of favoritism No one CaresPlace is DirtySupervisors keep quittingThey promote people who have no clue what they are doingWouldn’t recommend employment here unless it’s just a pit stop for you..
McKesson,Warehouse Worker,5,"Management could do better, but everyone friendly nicest place I ever worked at if you're good worker and willing to learn job easy if you're lazy it's going to be hard now there are lazy people there but that's everywhere I guess but overall it's a good working environment and good place good experience for me! "
McKesson,Project Manager,3,"No real training, no real processes/SOPs, weak leadership. You are thrown in and expected to thrive. There are some good leaders but they are far and few in between."
McKesson,Strategic Account Representative,3,Currently laying people off so job stability is questionable. I do love my job but am scared for the future. Organization is forever changing and roles and responsibilities are unclear. 
McKesson,Associate,5,This is a great place to work. They appreciate the effort of the employees. The warehouse is kept very clean. Most employees have to start on night shift but their are opportunities to go on day shift.
McKesson,Material Handler,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The environment the job is not hard one of the best I ever had good benefits and pay as well What is the most stressful part about working at the company?For the most part it’s not really stressful once you adjust to the freezer temperature everything else is fine What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Awesome everyone is like family What is a typical day like for you at the company?Great no complaints I just love my job
McKesson,Customer Service Representative,2,"Mandatory overtime all the time, no place for advancement, stressful work environment . They don’t make you feel appreciated and burn you out. I do not recommend."
McKesson,Sr. Financial Analyst 3,1,Stopped learning or growing as an employee as job duties were constantly diminished.   Micromanaging was a constant issue despite having taught  or mentored the entire team she managed.
McKesson,Pharmacy sales consultant ,5,"Great work culture, management team is proactive on employee survey result, great opportunity to advance your career. Big fortune 7 company. There is always something new in this industry which is fun! "
McKesson,Driver,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Being out on the road making the deliveries. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The handheld device can be a real hindrance to doing your job.  What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Your working day is split between working at the depot, scanning and sorting your load before you can fill your van. You get the chance to say a few things to fellow workers. Once you’ve filled your van you’ll leave the depot to complete your delivery route. Once away from the depot you’ll drive your route either by following order the handheld device suggests, or the order that you feel is best. The vans are tracked so the depot knows where you are at all times. You may be questioned to justify the route you choose to take. So it helps to be confident that the decisions you make will be acceptable to your manager. You will be trusted to a certain extent, the nature of the deliveries being drugs and medical supplies means the company needs to know what you are doing during your time making your deliveries. What is a typical day like for you at the company?You start early morning, once you get to the depot you’re expected to check the van for any issues (including damage, fuel and water levels, tyres). You sort your load and scan the boxes into the order of your delivery route. Then you load up your van before leaving the depot to start your delivery route. When you’ve delivered all the boxes to pharmacy outlets or GP surgeries you return to the depot and unload the empty boxes you collected - more..."
McKesson,Strategic customer account Analyst,4,Pros: excellent benefits; great work life balance and great flexibility. Cons: constant organizational changes; promotional opportunities can be slow; and fear of layoffs. 
McKesson,Sr. Strategic customer account analyst ,4,Pros: excellent benefits;  great work life balance and flexibility. Cons: constant organizational changes and changing responsibilities. Also fear of layoffs. 
McKesson,Shipping and Receiving,1,They make me do everything and sometimes do not consider me
McKesson,Administrator,5,Wonderful place to work at that values their employees. New tech was exciting. There was a lot of room for advancement with hard work and determination
McKesson,Inbound Material Handler,3,Start up meeting to get a rundown of what the day/night will look like. “Stretches” receive in product from boxes on pallets using RF scanners. Induct the received product and breakdown the boxes into totes to be put on conveyor. Putaway inducted products into assigned areas. Cycle count any specified areas to verify the quantity. 
McKesson,Customer Service Representative,5,I loved working here it was work from home and I loved my schedule it definitely taught you a lot and I did enjoy everything that I have learned from this place
McKesson,Material Handler/Forklift Operator,1,It is stressful and there a favorable people and race inside. They don’t allow you to move forward. It’s a dead end job. The people are unfriendly and seem to not want you there. 
McKesson,Delivery Driver,2,"Management only care about what the cameras in the vans tell them, you'll get infraction for taking a sip out of your water bottle. They could care less how you make your deliveries. My manager has a fit everyday going over my infractions of what the cameras tell him. Even if you look at your navigation as you drive, it's a strike, it's ridiculous. It's low pay for what you have to do.. You sweat for 2hrs loading your van, then you run your route, some of these medical places send you on a wild goose chase to find where they want it delivered. And these boxes are heavy, not good on your back by the end of your day No wonder they can't keep drivers, management hounds you for everything from the cameras. They could care less that you come back with an empty van everyday."
McKesson,Platinum Customer Care Professional,4,"Great place to work and learn the values of customer service, McKesson medical surgical is a great job too have and learn the customer service rules.."
McKesson,Analyst,5,"I was at McKesson for four years and really enjoyed my time there. People were nice and helpful, many internal opportunities to grow. Nice environment "
McKesson,Customer Service Representative,4,What is the best part of working at the company?I loved everything about it honestly. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The position I was hired for was seasonal so they laid us off with no warnings once blizzard was over. The call over to the pharmacy had very long wait periods and left patients upset.  everything else was cool
McKesson,SVP,5,"Great people, culture and purpose driven company. Competent Sr leadership that practices and models company values. Total benefits package competitive"
McKesson,Patient Service Specialist,5,I love working at McKesson. Since it is healthcare it can be busy however managers are very understanding. Good benefits! Taking time off is not a problem

McKesson,Case Picker/Shipper Receiver,5,"Nice place, nice people. Good bonuses each year, and 2 employee sales each year with really cheap goods. Room to move up if you want, or stay at whatever position you're hired at, pay is good."
McKesson,O.T.C Packer. Trident Refurbishment ,2,When I first started in 2000 it was a great place to work but in the last 4 or 5 years it as gone down. I stuck it out because the hours and days suited me and  I am getting older. I have now left because I was made redundant after 24 years if I was younger I would have left years a
McKesson,Sales Lead,5,Okay place nice interesting learned a lot would work again good time off and paid sick leave they care about employees and give us tons of chocolate yes 
McKesson,Material Handler,4,The pay is great for an entree level position. Mandatory overnights and mandatory overtime hurt the worklife balance. This is the perfect job for someone wanting to work a lot of hours and save money. Paychecks with OT was $1200-$1500. Expect to work 2-3 extra hours/day if a lot of people call off. 
McKesson,Safety & Security Supervisor,5,"In the SSO role, it can be very challenging as you have a lot to balance outside of your main job function as well. As long as you're willing to learn, the job can be done. You will have to be open to critique and have empathy for the employees you're working with. The work can be stressful, but if you work as a team, you'll be fine."

McKesson,Superviseur,2,"A typical working day: emergencies for lack of planning, meeting after meeting, constant changes of priorities, projects ready to deliver which are aborted without reason. Culture of the workplace: teamwork means a person who does the job for anyThe team. Directorate: blurred and nebulous communications, absence of clear priorities, roles and responsibilities change in 2 weeks and the credit of your work is allocated to a colleague or a superior."

McKesson,Warehouse Worker,1,When I first started was great but after being involved with the people and management and supervisors everything went downhill. There were just two people who were great to work with and always worked as a team. I had worked 3 positions in the warehouse and the only one that was okay was replenishments but was very unsupported by supervisors managers and leads. It was very hard because the manager was very selfish to a lot of employees who weren't in his inner circle or who he favored and it was very obvious too. He would promote those people who didn't deserve it or were bad at their jobs. Overall the warehouse management was very unprofessional. People acted the way they did because of how the warehouse was run by the manager. They had someone from the company always check in because of HR complaints but nothing changed. 
McKesson,Material Handler,1,If you want a job where you have no idea what time you're going home  then apply. If you want a job where management doesn't support you then apply. If you want to work with adults who act like they are in junior high by all means apply. 
McKesson,Parcel Delivery Driver,5,"Overall a great place to work for, management is great, paid time off is good and so are the benefits. Only left because of career change but I would recommend."
McKesson,CSR - Customer Service Representative,5,Greatest job to be at. Training was a challenge but once completed the job is a breeze. They have great policies and potential to grow within the company at a fast pace. I took the job for granted 
McKesson,Collections Specialist,1,Management has no clear directions and only make promises. They seem to only value their senior level employees and do not set up lower tier employees for success. 
McKesson,Quality Assurance Analyst,5,"Great job, pay could be better. The people you work with determine how it will go. Lots of room for advancement. If you like supply chain you’ll like it here "
McKesson,Delivery Route Driver,3,The job was pretty easy but the co workers aren’t the most helpful when you’re just starting and the bosses are little to no help at all. Once you learn yourself how to do things then it’s fine but everything else before hand is stressful 
McKesson,Customer Service Advisor,1,Had the worst time at mkesson - Lloyds pharmacy in walsgrave triangle at coventry. No room for progression at all and the main manager did a lot of favouritism! So glad I got out of that toxic fake environment 
McKesson,Material Handler,4,A day at work is easy. It’s the messy older people and those managers who show favoritism that makes the job harder. The hardest part is knowing you love your job but they don’t give a care in the world about you or what’s going on with you. It’s come to work or don’t have a job. I enjoy everyday cause everyone has a family to support. But when your body shuts down next person got your spot. But you got hurt there. SMH.

McKesson,"Warehouse Operative,  Team Leader",1,"All areas of the warehouse have incomplete teams, company refuses to hire staff in sufficient numbers, causing work in the warehouse to become generally much more heavy and stressful. Supervisors force some staff to work over pressured and overloaded dont treat some staff equally, and the pay ridiculously low."

McKesson,Warehouse Material Handler- Fulfillment Specialist,3,"Honestly, I am very grateful and thankful to McKesson for embracing me as part of a family team, and am blessed with memories of my team(s) ""thank you"".My efforts were countless, holding on as long as I possibly could, but due to unexpected hardships, self-negligence, loss of loved ones, and unseen abuse.The only 1 thing I know to do now is to be honest, tell the truth about everything in love thanks to some support of a mckesson team(s)"
McKesson,Pharmacy Technician,1,"for starters, everyone starts as a temp. you most likely WONT get hired no matter how hard you work or how much overtime (which is mandatory btw) you put in.  communication and training is TERRIBLE. you get eye rolls from employees that are scheduled to train you because they don't want to since it affects their numbers. you wont find out you made a mistake until they pretty much write you up or terminate you with no warning. then they lie to your recruiter that you’re not improving or some bs excuse.  at the end of the night you have supervisors yelling “15 minutes” to pressure employees to work faster instead of helping. over all, just not a great place to work as a pharmacy tech or clerk. not a stable job. as much as I hated retail pharmacy, I hated this more. you will live in constant paranoia wondering if you will be getting fired or not everyday because again, they will fire you for ANYTHING. stay away from this place"
McKesson,Case Manager,4,"Honest good work. Con- if you must use FMLA and situating pay if you happen to experience a terminally I’ll family member. Great work setting (I.e. desk, bathrooms, etc.)"
McKesson,Material Handler,3,"Fast paced if that’s your style, can make incentive. Hours can be long and strenuous, advice be in decent shape when applying to his job it will benefit you."

Some depts have access to bid on PTO,while others don't)What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Due to several temp workers, there is a high turnover rate."
McKesson,Customer Service Representative,2,This is a good company to work for. I love being able to work from home & the calls are slow and steady. Leadership team throws you to the wolves after training. 
McKesson,Lab Customer Service Associate,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Versatile.  Flexible Good benefits.  Lots of opportunities. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?With 90 percent of us working out of our own homes, it's beautiful, Not a lot of stress. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?They except all! They push for all to be themselves."
McKesson,Pharmacy Technician,2,Work day vary to make sure work is completed for the day.Employees are great to work with. Management team are not fair to the employees especially if you are a female. So if you are a male you definitely have it made.There is no hard part about the job very easy.They have a HR department but not fair to the employees. Will only take the word of the management team and do nothing to help the employees
McKesson,Case Manager,2,"Another company fueled by dictatorship. No clear direction or guidance, no rapport and the leadership could care less about investing in your success as an employee. The work was rewarding knowing that I was helping children obtain their medication, but the workplace culture was full of virtual drama which was the hardest part about working here. I learned that all organizations have the same leadership style, it's like it's almost a universal style of leading. "
McKesson,Network Engineer,1,"It used to be a good company when it was managed by the Canadians. Not the case anymore. They will do whatever it takes to max profits... job cuts, outsourcing from cheaper countries"
McKesson,Driver,3,"Good place to work, work load can get busy on certain days or around bank holidays Management are ok Don’t like when you are not able to delivery everything which is understandable but sometimes it’s out of your control "
McKesson,Operations Coordinator,3,"Great place to learn about supply chain, but can be difficult to move up within the distribution center. A lot of busy work is give. Not much responsibility is given."
Cencora,Customer Implementation Specialist,4,"Good company with good pay, but workload can be high. Business is complicated as well, but overall a good work life balance and a good company. Benefits are good."
Cencora,Remote,3,"They switch managers to somebody that was not caring of other people, Not trustworthy management, but the teams are goodOther than that, it’s pretty good job"
Cencora,Manager,1,Top talent that been with the start up are not leaving the facility due to the micromanging of a Sr. Manager. More people will be leaving out the door and they will have a fresh new start with new people.
Cencora,Pharmacy Assistant,5,Nice pace to work.Good work life balance Good Team Overload sometimes but benefits are lessNeed more payMore work needs to be done on managing work Place is clean
Cencora,Warehouse Manager,3,So my role consist of checking emails any issues going on with orders and check in with Supervisir once I’m done to see what they have to catch up on. Look at numbers talk about what team members are not meeting. You do work a lot with HR and no HR in the building which causes you more time and the pay is not the best based on the duties. 
Cencora,Technical Business Analyst,4,"Cencora is a great company to work for in most respects, as they provide fair pay and good benefits. However it is difficult to progress or have a strong career progression, to the point that many personnel leave the company shortly, only to be rehired within a year at higher pay scale. "
Cencora,Warehouse Associate,4,It's a loving place that is welcoming loving. Treats you like a family member.  The works hours can be tiring given that the employee doesn t give flexible time and can work overnight
Cencora,Reimbursement Specialist,4,Great employer to work for and good benefits. There is room for advancement.  Monday through Friday with flexible schedules. Management was always there when needed.
Cencora,Driver,2,"Sub contract workload.to a third party Having to work a 6 day week(un negotiable) Expected to work for what works out at £12 ph, on a 48 hour working week.Try DHL/DPD for a lot more pay. Joke"
Cencora,Data Intake Specialist,2,"Before Cencora stepped in our company was AmerisourceBergen/The Lash Group which was a very employee friendly company. Since Cencora has taking over, all OT has been stopped, we no longer receive quarterly bonuses they are now annual & no matter how good of a job you do your bonus will be the same as everyone else in the company which was $700 last year. Most positions with the company rather on the phones or not were very flexible with breaks & lunches but now they are all scheduled which puts a halt on the work like balance we were use to. It's really not the same. When getting a ""promotion"" you probably won't be able to negotiate you salary, they'll give you an extra $1 & you just have to accept it. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
Cencora,Cleaner (part-time),2,"After a few months working in here. Everyone is very friendly, chatting and helping out when I'm stuck. Other bad thing will be on leadership, they have put me off. Not their section, but she will come to me and ask me did you do it. That question make me very uncomfortable as I'm not only cleaner there. Why asked. Not her section of work too. If I said no, she will email to my boss. Asking me lot from leadership is enough from them. I know who is off just don't go in. Avoid! He will complain me to my boss all the time. If you are girl don't go there. They will pick on you. Not very fair. If have other job offer I may go from. Not helpful leadership team. Won't make me happy. Can get cover but he doesn't do it that day. Then I'm learning dont do too much. I won't able to do 3 person jobs in 4 hours. So stay away if you can. But nice staff is true something I will miss it. Not leadership in warehouse. Rubbish! Need better training from leadership! "
Cencora,Business Analyst,3,very low promotion or salary increase. Only pros are benefits and PTO days. you'll never get above 3 percent year over year. Upper Management is awful 
Cencora,Program Coordinator/Supervisor,2,"The work is remote and as a Program Coordinator/Supervisor you do not have a set schedule. One week it’s 8am-430pm, 2nd week it’s 9am to 530pm, 3rd week it’s 9:30am to 6pm and 4th week it’s 11:30am to 8pm. It is extremely hard to move up but if your productivity and customer service skills are great, it’s not hard. You must be a yes man no matter what, make no waves and do not have a voice or opinion and they will love you. Management is hit or miss, they definitely do not want anyone that takes FMLA, it is highly frowned upon and if you have more than one medical issue, you might as well see yourself out the door soon. No compassion or humanity from up above unless you are from the LGBT community which is a pro because they are a diverse company. Hardest part of the job is being a supervisor because we are over the pharmacy care coordinators so do and will run to our managers if they do not like something you have to say,, even if it was meant to positive or helpful. We are remote so things constantly gets taken out of context. Hardest part of the job is being short staffed, we were supposed to have 4 Program Coordinator’s and we constantly are always sitting with only 2 and we supervise 80 Pharmacy Care Coordinator’s and don’t ask management to help because they will ignore you and on purpose too. The most enjoyable thing about the job is the amount of PTO you get and the benefits. "
Cencora,Business Analyst,4,"Large company, decent pay, solid benefits. I had a good manager and team. I feel like if you have good people around you, then you will succeed. Opportunities for growth are there amongst other operational teams, but a little more difficult for a Business Analyst."
Cencora,Service Representative,5,Love it. Overall good place to work . Excited to grow within the company and look forward to meeting new people even though it's a remote position. New beginnings 
Cencora,Responsable de Operaciones,1,"What is the best thing to work in the company?- In that company there is nothing good, neither the location, nor the direction, nor the HR, nor the environment- between toxic and very toxic- and much less the salaries., defamation and bad ways are spoiled and normalized.10% of the template is low due to harassment or depression.It is best to run away as possible.The worst of that company is not that the valid staff leaves, is that what remains there are ""labor spoils"" that cannot survive;much less find work in other companies.The level of plugged employees is blatantly high. What is the most stressful of working in the company? Having fewer employees needed to be able to work without stress.The workplace harassment allowed in all its variants.The little salary and the null possibility of moving forward. How are the environment and work culture in the company? Malo and work culture does not exite.For not existing there is no company committee or the agreement is applied, which surprisingly, is that of offices and offices in a hospital logistics company.Constant abuses to the rights of workers without shame.Work tirelessly, literal.Guards that are not paid."
Cencora,Warehouse Associate,5,Good place to work. The hours can be long but the pay and benefits are good. Employees are valued and are cared for by the company. Opportunity to move up in the company
Cencora,Business Analyst,4,I enjoy my work -great work life balance. I enjoy solving problems daily and contributing to health care. The company is what you make of it. Easy to move around.
Cencora,Patient Access Specialist,1,I was offer a position and then put on backup list. I almost quit my job or went part time. I was also told that this will be Temporary” maybe possible HIRE IN after 1/25.
Cencora,Nurse Navigator,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?The pay was good, many of my coworkers were genuinely nice and supportive What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Aux codes and zero trust or autonomy What is the work environment and culture like at the company?High stress, secretive and dishonest leadership What is a typical day like for you at the company?Nonstop calls and being badgered on teams if not on next call quick enough"
Cencora,Warehouse Associate,1,Felt unappreciated for all the work that was done and  the pay was not enough to stay. Was overworked and there was no advancement in the company and the work environment is very toxic. 
Cencora,Customer Implementation Specialist,4,"Good company with good pay, but workload can be high. Business is complicated as well, but overall a good work life balance and a good company. Benefits are good."
Cencora,Sr.Warehouse Returns Clerk,2,"The management plays favorites with the employees and judges a book by the cover. They want to know how you feel but nothing changes. They also do some shady things. All they care about is making money, not about employees or their family. No set schedule, never know when you're going home but if you leave early, they give you a point, even if you have PTO."
Cencora,Aps,4,Hours can get long but that doesn't bother me as much as others. Decent amount of pay and is stable. The turn over rate is high but it probably is the overtime and long Sundays
Cencora,Senior Warehouse Associate,2,"This place has toxic management, poor communication amongst leadership and with the associates. Benefits are good, your actual coworkers are good, the work environment just isn’t worker friendly. No work life balance. A lot of mandatory overtime, last minute holiday schedule changes. "
Cencora,Case Manager,3,"Independent work. No micro managing. Very tedious work. Changes happen very frequently and very fast. Expected to remember a lot of knowledge. Poor management for the most part, a couple members of mgmt are superior. "
Cencora,IT Service Desk Analyst,1,"I had a frustrating experience with this company regarding the IT Support Analyst role. After being hired and receiving an offer letter, I signed the contract, only to have the offer withdrawn without any explanation. Despite several attempts to reach out to HR, I received no response.This lack of communication and poor management is highly unprofessional. I would advise anyone considering an IT role here to be cautious. The management’s handling of the hiring process reflects a serious lack of reliability and respect for candidates."
Cencora,Customer Service Representative,4,Great team hardworking team that love to help and are very supportive you can learn a lot is. Is a great job for beginners help you to improve and be a better you
Cencora,Case Manager,1,You get hired to get changed positions and tasks constantly and then expect to know the material and then have no help but from a teams chat to guide your every day work while your being rated constantly. 
Cencora,Warehouse Associate,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Not a good place to work. You never know when you’re going to get off of work. Management is cutthroat & so are your coworkers! What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Having to deal with the rest of the employees What is the work environment and culture like at the company?They bird dog you all of the time! It’s a stressful environment. They should pay more for the amount of physical work that you’re expected to do. You have to get everything you need before you can even start working. It’s too much! What is a typical day like for you at the company?A lot of physical work for not enough pay. They don’t value their employees at all
Cencora,PAS,2,"It is really hard to move up in your role.  There is no room for growth. Benefits are pretty good and pay is ok, but could be more due to the amount of work. "
Cencora,Supervisor,4,Love everything except work/ life balance. People are great and there is a feeling of purpose getting medications to patient's. Good pay and benefits. 
Cencora,Patient Service Representative,1,"This job is so unorganized and very demanding. You will be overworked and overwhelmed by management and forced to complete multiple tasks, and rarely given a pay increase. The only time there is overtime, is usually between January through April. Be prepared to spend majority of your shifts answering inbound phone calls, and not having much time to complete your other assigned tasks. "
Cencora,Patient Access Specialist,5,"No micromanaging,  fair caseload, pretty good pay with annual raises. Some teams offer bonuses as well. Room for advancement. Managers are pretty decent but that also depends on who you get."
Cencora,Warehouse Associate/ Shift lead,4,What is the best part of working at the company?The people. Night shift day shift doesn’t matter the people are the best part.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The difficulty to keep the place staffed the higher higher ups not understanding stuff
Cencora,Oc,3,"Management doesn't listen, ot is mandatory. I see my coworkers more then my family. The only reason it's getting 3 stars is because my coworkers make it bearable."

Cencora,A,1,"When clicking on the company page, time does not open page information"
Cencora,Telehealth Nurse Educator/Case Manger,5,Good Training initially and ongoing.  Remote worm with excellent support. Great benefits including PTO and holidays. Professionals on management team.  
Cencora,Warehouse Worker,3,It a union company and always put lowest seniority to work late even tho you don’t know what to do. Management isn’t union so it make thing awkward when you run into trouble so you have to get a rep for something like write up for calling in sick. I was a fast learner so I get float a lot. 
Cencora,Sr. Warehouse Associate,1,Worst Management ever. No communication at all. Don’t meet your numbers you get wrote up for it. Wouldn’t recommend this place at all. The Manager the worst there can be. Lost 5 employees within a week.
Cencora,Benefits Specialist,4,Very nice manager productive workplace.  Teammates are also very nice and will help with any questions you have. Wish training was a bit longer and longer shadowing time but it’s okay.
Cencora,Customer Implementation Specialist,4,"Good company with good pay, but workload can be high. Business is complicated as well, but overall a good work life balance and a good company. Benefits are good."
Cencora,HR service representative ,4,Compensation is excellent compared to other places and the benefits also has a generous subsidy and bonus.It is a very new company in Costa Rica but it seems to be good
Cencora,Inventory Control Clerk,5,"Most everyone is friendly and helpful. My Manager is outstanding!  I really enjoy my job. I was trained to operate the Cherry Picker Lift. Learned how to operate an RF unit, perform cycle counts, receive product, etc."
Cencora,Maintenance Technician,3,Not knowing if your working weekend until friday. Not a bad place just busy. Management listens but not much they can do. Work life balance getting worse.
Cencora,Patient Service Representative,5,This company is a good company to work for they have good benefits and management is also good to you as well. Sometimes the job can be very stressful but overall good job to work for and gain experience 
Cencora,Freezer/Cooler Associate,1,"management is never on time for anything , no rewards for the deserving but praise for the bare minimum true blue points were received late and no remorse for wrong doing hard dedicated workers"
Cencora,Patient Service Representative,3,Horrible 2023-2024 CW seasonLots of resources in SharePointHardest part of job was being trained but not getting enough calls during daytime shiftI like the different types of people to work with and work as a team
Cencora,Customer Service Specialist,1,Unprofessional managementlack of experience in supervisor levelfavoritism towards certain employeespay is too low for all the work that needs to be donetraining class time was the best time. supervisors won't speak to you and getting help after training is always a struggle
Cencora,Patient Access Consultant,1,Remote work and was laid off not worth it at all. Worst managers ever not supportive. No leadership at all. Do not work here ever. Not worth your time.
Cencora,Forklift Operator,5,"Fun place to work I would love to work and do my best to elevate the company Give us your opinion about:a typical day at work,what you believe you learned,management,workplace culture,the hardest part of the job,the most enjoyable part of the job77 characters (150 minimum)"
Cencora,Account Manager,4,"A great company, but large.  Hard to maneuver up unless you play the game plus a bit of luck.  Great benefits, not particularly challenging, good kush gigs.  "
Cencora,Inventory Team Lead,5,I consider my coworkers to be family; we have fun but get the job done. There is sufficient training available. Most people have been on the job for many years.
Cencora,Distribution Supervisor,1,Plan on working 50+ hrs every week. Upper management does not value their supervisors. Upper management mis-manages their supervisors hours by not staggering start times. Underpaid especially given the amount of time spent at work. This company goes through about 2-3 supervisors every year as people realize the true hours worked. The communication is poor especially when it comes to scheduling as you have to assume your schedule has changed with no notice from upper management or HR. The Brooks team has some great supervisors that would be better suited at other companies that would value their talents. This is the culture at Cencora Brooks. As I said before they go through several supervisors year to year and as a result they are in this vicious cycle. The hourly workers are probably the only thing great about the company that and the service provided is life saving but how do you expect to keep talent if you can’t manage the hours properly. You do not need to be a DO to figure that out.
Cencora,Customer Service Associate,5,Pretty inclusive of all people. Culture is mission guided by customer service quality excellence. In terms of ontime delivery. Shipment accuracy. Client specific logistics solutions. Effective team management skills. 
Cencora,RN Nurse Educator,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Good benefits and good reputation.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Ridges, lacks flexibility and has a degree of micromanagement"
Cencora,Compliance Manager,3,Your experience will depend entirely on the department you work in. Lack of communication and coordination between business units. Lack of standardization. 
Cencora,Special Projects Liaison ,4,"I have been here since 2018. Started as temp employee was hired on after 8 months. I was promoted, then promoted again. I have been reading reviews and whole heartedly do NOT agree. If you work hard at this company you can advance. I was upset about the bonus being changed from quarterly to annually but companies do not have to give a bonus- so I am appreciative of what I get. I do think the pay should be more competitive and increase according to the cost of living. I have always had great managers but there are some on my team that do not need to be in management. They do not reply to their associates who in turn have to reach out to me for assistance. Production is a huge deal here but if you are at your desk and working, not hard to meet. We used to have phone reps and processors- they introduced new hybrid model that IMO is not panning out. A lot of reps have quit due to this. Remote work is not for everyone- you have to be incredibly disciplined. "
Cencora,Customer Service Representative,5,This job has an incredible work life balance and the pay is definitely worth it! Working from home is a huge plus however the only downside is that you are tethered to your desk all day.
Cencora,Benefits Verification Specialist,5,"Awesome place to work at, people are great and the job isn't too hard to understand. The training really helps you get it and management is awesome. I love it here."
Cencora,Quality control specialist,3,"Company going through a rebranding. During my 20 months working there, there was quite a reorganization of roles. Our group was not affected. We all worked well together but coverage could be better with an additional person. I enjoyed my time there, but after 6 months, the work was repetitive. A typical day is the review of caseworker notes for completeness, accuracy, and looking for adverse events that were not reported."
Cencora,Receiving,4,"Just as anyother place of employment, mind your own and don’t get caught up in the drama or gossip. Get in do your time, get your work done, get paid and go home.  Benefits were competitive. Vacation time was good. "
Cencora,Customer Implementation Specialist,4,"Good company with good pay, but workload can be high. Business is complicated as well, but overall a good work life balance and a good company. Benefits are good."
Cencora,Patient Access Coordinator,2,"Unfortunately everything that I loved about this company has dissipated. Some higher ups decided to remove quarterly bonuses and replace them with yearly payouts. This “Healthcare” company only offers sick days to individuals in certain states while granting these individuals the same amount of PTO as the rest of those who receive write ups for being sick. Cencora does NOT reimburse for internet. Productivity expectations are asinine but thrown at you daily as a way to threaten your job. The yearly raises… Literally PENNIES on the dollar. Job security there’s none one day you’re here the next day you’re not. Management (NOT all) tend to be disconnected, insensitive, and inconsiderate. Job advancement … Ha! A Joke, higher positions rarely come around these days and when they do they’re already filled. Employee appreciation is shown by nothing more than a company email that includes a smiling face. The rich literally get richer here and unfortunately the bottom workers get poorer. I hate to think that everything in America has increased by dollars except for my wages here. "
Cencora,Warehouse Associate,2,"Management doesn't care about their workers, the only thing they care about if the work gets done. THE ONLY OK position to be hired is REPO stay away from the receiving department. Favoritism gets blown off and the supervisor is a complete airhead.  "
Cencora,Lead,3,If you have a family don't work here now work home life balance 12 hour days 5 days a week you will be lucky to work a 9 to 10 hour day.Growth here is based on who you know or who you are related to nepotism is strong here. If you do work here don't be a free thinker because you will just get used and discarded and others will run with your ideas. No loyalty to there employees either your just a number. And if that number don't match up you are out the door.
Cencora,Patient Service Representative,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?as a contract employee, I found it difficult to keep up with production numbers and also be accurate with everything.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Receiving your production numbers and being told that you have weren’t reaching them enough and you were still busy the whole time during the dayWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?You don’t really get to speak with the supervisors at all unless you’re being corrected on some thing, everything‘s through chat. Also, it seems that you’re guilty to proven innocent if something happens.What is a typical day like for you at the company?You can’t really even step away. You can’t tell anybody in the chat that you’re stepping away for an emergency you have to be 100% productive 100% of the day."
Cencora,Benefits Specialist,5,"Management can be stuck up, but the leads are fun and encouraging to work with! KPI ‘s are hard at first to meet but once you get the swing of things, it become easier, pay should be better compared to the workload."
Cencora,Sr. Warehouse Associate,3,"Anyone can get away with anything , some supervisors are meant to be supervisors and if something is brought up or someone speaks up, it is always brushed off"
Cencora,Patient Access Representative Case Manager,1,Stressful. With very little appreciation.Monitored closely and coached No value placed on your work They talk the talk but never walk the walk  Like it or not you are working in a call center. And still have to finish tasks.  Not an enjoyable job in the least 
Cencora,Warehouse Associate,1,I would not recommend anyone to work here you get 3 call offs which is reasonable but when you have a mother with severe mental health issues and grandfather thats on his death bed you need to have management thats caring and understanding. And even if you have a good resume they will hire immigrants over you for the tax cuts and ESG score. DO NOT WORK HERE UNLESS YOUR LIFE IS PERFECT AND YOU NEVER GET SICK!!!!
Cencora,Remote Customer Service Representative,3,"Financial help for medication.Micromanagement from so many directions.Many secretive.Even the supervisor's actions reflect that they experience it.They appear nice & helpful,but are often condescending&overworked.Time limits stand even when patients need more. I heard many reps ignore,talk over & cut off innocent sick or seniors in need just so as to get mandatory verbage in,meet the call & after call times. It's quite sad.Also,if you don't question & report any hint of a possible medication side effect (this is a clinical job,not non- clinical job) then you will be terminated. May've stayed if changes,but relieved now that I didn't. It's sad that a program's set up to help sick people afford a medication to save their lives,but there's not much time allowed for real compassion."
Cencora,Patient Service Specialist,4,Very great place to work if you have a great client. But if you have a client that changes the policies and workflow constantly then it can make things difficult for people to catch on which I turn puts getting work behind. 
Cencora,APS Warehouse Associate,1,Be on time or you are written up.  Not honest with room for advancement.  Revolving door with management.  Hardest part of the job is when they provide pizza you know you will be working 3 extra hours for that shift.  We ate a lot of pizza.
Cencora,Patient Service Representative,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The ability to help those in need What is the most stressful part about working at the company?I didn't have must I didn't like about working with the company What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Pleasant and inviting place to work What is a typical day like for you at the company?You are busy the entire day and always learning something new about the job
Cencora,Patient Support Navigator,4,I loved working from home. The benefits and pay are good but the leadership was terrible. A good place to work if you keep your head down and do what’s asked. 
Cencora,Warehouse Associate,5,It is a good place to work if you don’t mind overtime and basically wanna spend your life here. Working Sunday has to be the thing that sucks but other than that it’s good and the money is amazing
Cencora,Patient Navigator,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Chaotic, unorganized, low level employees don't matter What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lack of empathy from managementWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Horrible culture; remote work awesome"
Cencora,nice,5,nice company to work with friendly environment and more number of staff are friendly in manner and pay scale improving with good rating and if you work hard you can claim the good position 
Cencora,Warehouse Associate,5,"Great payBenefits day 12,000 sign on bonusPtoWork life balanceThis a great company to work for they will train you. Very self pace. No micro managing "
Cencora,PMO 2 Lead,2,Yes you can leave for unplanned appointment and planned but you will get a point. They don't stop you from leaving. Schedule appointment then have to know in advance and if two people are off that day they will not grant you that day. So it will be unscheduled PTO. They give a lot of time off. However the are very disorganized and to move up in the company depends on how bad they need you in that position. They can and will hold you back. Very poor communication!
Cencora,Controls Technician,4,"Like every other company with industrial maintenance there is a shortage of experienced techs. Pay is decent, lower to midrange. Good benefits. Climate controled building. During production they want the equipment fixed NOW. "
Cencora,Warehouse Associate,2,"It is very hard at this job to move up and grow. The management does not care about most of its employees. While I was working there multiple people including myself, would try to expand our knowledge and skills within the workplace. Often times the management would agree to cross train but then failed to do so. They always put off what the employees ask, and any concerns they have within the company. I would not recommend this place to anyone, not even for a short term job. There is way better out there. "
Cencora,Customer Implementation Specialist,4,"Good company with good pay, but workload can be high. Business is complicated as well, but overall a good work life balance and a good company. Benefits are good."
Cencora,Operations Specialist,3,"Cencora is a well paying job, however if you work in the operation department everyone hates each other. Maybe even in the other departments too. They walk around and don’t make eye contact with each other; especially if you are a disliked person. The facility in Long Island is mentally draining and everyone acts like they are in high school. Talking from whispers and giggles. It feels like a cycle to be there everyday. Besides that, the work is tedious. If you apply yourself and take notes you will be able to do your job but everyday something new pops up because it is the movement of goods and things constantly are changing at the airports and airlines. "
Cencora,Cencora,5,"Cencora formally AmerisourceBergen or Lash Group, is overall an excellent company to work for. Being completely transparent the senior leadership and team managers I have experience over the years have be great, you couldn't ask for better management easy to talk too. PTO is great and fair. Remote work so the work life balance is also great. As a company they follow quitelines and provide excellent yearly training to put the needs of the client and patient first and that's rewarding. However the con in my opinion is the pay per the time of employment. I myself have been employed over a decade and make less than $19. High performer and exceeds productivity expectation year after yr. Same for many others. That would be ok if career pathing was clear and it was easy to advance within the company, but once you start Here it is hard to move up. In my department there are people who have been here well over a decade and a half due to how excellent the managers are. Honestly what's keeps people at the company for a long time is great management and work life balance.  But unless you are in management or operations, do not expect to move up within the company easily, or fair raise increases usually .50 or less exceeding expectation.  I can only speak on my experience and leave a transparent review to help others.  Would I refer the company overall YES."
Cencora,Package Technician,3,"The pros are that the pay, PTO and health insurance are good. Also, the work is pretty easy. The cons of the job is that management is not that great. They have their favorites . And it’s political feeling. "
Cencora,Recieving Associate,3,"Working environment is all right came in to a hostile environment, working 9 to 11 hours. Although not too bad of a job, definitely makes you good money "
Cencora,Personal Care Specialist,2,"This company has been great to work for in the past however policy changes, employee turnover, lack of appropriate support, and unmanageable workload has created a toxic environment to be in."
Cencora,Warehouse Associate,2,Very toxic environment to much micromanagement going on. Work the good people to death and the laggers get missing. Management is a joke they are clueless. 
Cencora,Picker/Packer,1,"Expect too much but don’t properly train, especially with the scanner. Sometime we don’t get a break even though we’re working 12+ hours. On that subject everyday we are staying 12+ hours instead of the agreed 8 hour shift"
Cencora,Commercial Operations Analyst,2,"Opportunities presented to grow and take on additional responsibilities, however  there are so many politics at the senior levels.  In order to grow you must have the right alliances."
Cencora,Benefits Specialist,1,"The most amazing thing about this job? The fact you don't get any inbound calls from anyone. You're the only person making calls and they're usually short lived if at all. You're pressured constantly to go faster and faster. But, if you're trying to verify the information is correct you kind of need to take your time and make sure all the information you're giving and receiving is 100% correct or you'll be doing it all over again. The managers are awful. There's lots of data entry which is nice as well. No benefits, no paid holidays, no room for growth, rude as EVER peers, and you are only allowed overtime if 1. You're making a certain goal and 2. You get it approved. The peers favor certain people and the job security is non existent. If this sounds like your kind of job, go ahead and apply but when you're miserable don't say I didn't warn you.... "
Cencora,Care Representative ,2,"The focus is on numbers and the customer  , I understand the focus being on the customer Then you have the customer who speak to you and dehumanize you ! While the supervisor does nothing, when you bring it to their attention it is never discussed again. Then you have the minute mangers!  Who do not allow you the time you need off the phone to work cases for follow up.You’ve been off the phone now for 5 minutes get back to work now. Then the horn sounds.you’re sitting for 8 hours getting hemorrhoids!"
Cencora,Wharehouse Associate,2,Worked there for almost 2 months and everything was OK I supposed. They really do care about numbers and your work output. I guess you can say. No matter how much work you do or how hard you work they don’t really show appreciation for that as long as you have good numbers. Then will fire you once they fill your numbers in production or not up to what they want which is weird when you really think about how much you do throughout the day there. 
Cencora,Order Puller,1,"All this company cares about is making money, it is the epitome of corporate greed and towing the corporate line. They don't care about their customers or their employees. They treat their employees like disposable fodder. Turnover is unbelievably bad. There is no work/life balance, you work anywhere from 50 to 60 (sometimes more) hours a week (which sometimes is 6 or even 7 days). You are expected to work until the daily work is done, even if that means 12 to 15 hours. Management is a joke and the turnover rate of managers, supervisors, and leads is also unbelievable.  One manager was even fired for threatening an employee.  They are currently in the process of terminating as many tenured employees as they can. This is not a good company to work for.  "
Cencora,Senior Associate,5,I love my trainers and managers. Everyone is very sweet and respectful. They make sure you’re fully trained to succeed. I learned a lot already and i’ve been working there for 2 years
Cencora,Warehouse Worker,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Some of the workers I work with.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?You get points if you call in sick and after so many points you get fired. People come in all the time sick or have covid so they don't get point.  If you have any medical issues don't work here they don't care about your medical situation they just want you to be at work everyday and work all the hours they ask you to work in a day. Some departments work 13+ hours a day. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful.  Some people love to just work their life away while others complain about all the hours and the point system they have.  People don't want to work every holiday.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Come in and get as much work as I can get done and hope it's enough so we don't have to keep working overtime all the time.
Cencora,Patient Access Specialist,4,The pay is ok if you are new to working from home. If you are hired under a contract you never know when your day is your last day. The SALs are understanding and very helpful
Cencora,Technical Support Representative,4,It is a wonderful place to work. The knowledge you need can be a bit overwhelming initially but once you are trained it helps you problem solve in all areas of your job. 
Cencora,Director,3,"At the turn of every fiscal year, leadership shakes up departments and teams and either add or reduce headcount. It’s impossible to feel secure in that a constantly churning environment. "
Cencora,Sales Representative,3,"It was okay. I really liked the team I worked with, but the company did a round of layoffs in 2023 and cut my entire team. It was hard to get motivated to work after that. "
Cencora,Warehouse Associate,2,"a typical day would be  good if the management didn't suck. they try to do more work than they can handle.  in all actuality, that's why we cant keep nobody as it is.  no one wants to work pass eight to ten hours. "
Cencora,Senior Warehouse Associate,4,Lots of overtime if you love it and have nothing else going on then this is perfect for you. Lots of the people here are nice and friendly and management is a bit iffy and unpredictable. But if your here to make money then it’s a great job
Costco Wholesale,Membership Clerk,4,"Overall I loved Costco. it was my first job and I could not be more grateful for the opportunity. you have good benefits, meet a lot of people, and have so many perks. However, it is a seniority-based company so in old warehouses it would be hard to get your PTO the times you want it etc. "
Costco Wholesale,Sales Assistant,4,it is a very boring place to work but is very consistent and stable. they pay more on Sundays and holidays. The co workers are great made a few friends.
Costco Wholesale,Account Manager,5,Costco gave me a solid foundation and connection to move forward in my career. it can be hard to be recognized due to massive employee count.great benefits and extra bonuses.
Costco Wholesale,Service Assistant,2,You have to get a good location and whatever you do don't work in the food court every single food service job included McD is better than working in that food court
Costco Wholesale,Call Centre Agent,2,"Stressful work environment with little compensation, toxic coworkers and management and high turnover rate. There’s benefits as a part time employee which would be the only good side"
Costco Wholesale,Stocker,5,"Very good people, good benefits and good pay. Lots of room for growth and advancement. Learned alot about the company and how it began.  Management is willing to offer help when needed!"
Costco Wholesale,Produce Supervisor,2,"There is a deficit in the organizational infrastructure, and the inability or unwillingness from management to provide organizational resilience in the infrastructure. The lack of managerial accountability, agency, resilience, and support was close to non-existent. This Warehouse did not facilitate the success needed in leadership roles. The GM espouses high standards but is unable to enforce those standards or foster a culture that values those cultures."
Costco Wholesale,Service Crew,3,"Good benefits and managers adjust sometimes for your need. However, when there are unprofessionalism in a certain department, they dont address it. YOure always suppose to be in your fight mode because you will be working with people that don't have good manners and right conduct. "
Costco Wholesale,Front End Associate,2,"If you’re hired on as a seasonal at San Bernardino's Store#478 and you really want to become a permanent hire after the season ends the general way to do that is make sure ur always on time, don’t call out, never stand around, keep a fast pace and you’ll probably get hired on… Well that isn’t true.  You should definitely follow those guidelines BUT in reality only ONE thing matters above all else you MUST participate in the social politics that are very noticeable at store #478 otherwise you can work till your feet bleed and it won’t matter. TIP:  Prioritize being friendly with management (especially FEMALE managers)  you should be able to figure out quickly who that manager is. Once you have done that then just casually work at the same pace as everyone else (don’t go above and beyond, that was my mistake) and you’ll probably get hired on at the end of the seasons. Best of luck 👍🏻"
Costco Wholesale,Fulfillment Supervisor,5,Costco is a Multicultural place to work. Inclusion is one of the most important values of the company.Management is always ready to listen to employees ideas creating this way a lot of room for Carrie development.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with some hard to please members.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It is a great work environment. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Start the day by getting the store ready to open. Then make sure everything  is clean and working properly.
Costco Wholesale,Production Assistant,4,"I got asked “is it true you make $25 an hour?!” a lot by non employees so I’m gonna answer: Yes but you have to work a lot of hours on record. It takes years.

Costco Wholesale,Front End Assistant,4,We were told more than 90% of seasonal help is retained after the holiday season. This is not accurate. Only 2 of 20+ people were kept on in the frontend position.
Costco Wholesale,Certified Pharmacy Clerk,1,The management is horrible. The job itself is nice. The pay is decent and the wage increases are fair. Christmas bonus is nice. When having concerns the management does not try to help from an employee’s perspective. 
Costco Wholesale,Cruise Agent,4,"Costco Travel offers good training, advancement opportunities, along with competitive wages and benefits, including 401k. My recommendation would be to, once hired, take advantage of all training opportunities. As with any company, Costco Travel likes 'go getters' and there is a risk of becoming stagnant if staying in one role too long. "

Costco Wholesale,Stocker,5,"I enjoyed working at Costco as a morning merch stocker, but left due to the hours and starting a family. Management was good and camaraderie among employees was good. Safety was always a priority and I felt I was trained well."
Costco Wholesale,Front End Associate,5,"I recently had the pleasure of working at CostCo as our front assistant, and I can't recommend them highly enough. Their professionalism and attention to detail made a significant impact on our daily operations. They consistently demonstrated excellent organizational skills and a friendly demeanor, making both members and staff feel welcome and valued."
Costco Wholesale,Merchant,1,"Costco used to be a great place to work, and for those in the old pay scale (1000 to get raises), it still might be, but corporate is trimming hours, expecting more work for the same pay, turning everything into a toxic soup of asinine goals that then get shouted at employees, and the work is so physically demanding that it’s not uncommon for several people to be out of medical leave, managers to be out long term from problems that have resulted from years of working at Costco, and for everyone to be so burnt out from the old school management style, lack of communication, lack of training, empty promises from corporate, toxic leadership style (often manipulative), high turn over, and the lack of a career ladder (promotions are nepotism based), that understanding things will only get worse is forcing them to apply elsewhere. So, if you’re thinking about making Costco your job or career, don’t, it’s not what you think it is, and it’ll only get worse. "
Costco Wholesale,Front End Associate,4,"A typical work day was a lot, depending on how busy the store was. I often felt sore at the end of the day because of all the heavy lifting. As a front end assistant, I floated around depending on the needs. Sometimes, I collected trash outside, sometimes I helped with carts, sometimes I put back returns, etc. My back was just really sore after work. "

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Nothing stressful about the job. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Awful, employees and management cannot stand each other. No camaraderie among employees of different departments. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Typically, you can expect to come into work and see the warehouse is low staff, with nothing being done to fix the issue. Expect to work your section alone without a team, or to be shipped away from your designated position/section to cover for low staffs in other sections. You're most likely doing the workload equivalent of 3-4 employees by the end of your shift."
Costco Wholesale,Forklift Operator,5,Ive worked here for about 9 years. Great oay once youre topped out....they treat part timers like poo but if you brown nosw enough you can make it far.

Costco Wholesale,Cashier Assistant,3,being front end and especially at a costco is not a good first job position to be in. unless you love boxing countless of items in a specific manner and worrying about instacarts that ask for specific things to be done in a certain way. and its especially a poorly matched position for anyone who suffers from any work related anxiety and stress + depression. not good for the mental 
Costco Wholesale,Member Service Representative,4,really nice place to work nice people. of course it is customer service so you get a lot of situations but overall good and decent pay with good benefits and decent pay.
Costco Wholesale,Front End Associate,3,Free membership is the best thing the job itself demands alot of customer service and sometimes can get frustrating. All depends on management that's supportive 
Costco Wholesale,Cashier,5,Very good place to work they start at 19.00 top scale being 33.40. They also give bonuses 2 times a year no matter how you or the company does it’s guaranteed to all top scale employees 80 percent benefits free mental health counseling for both you and your loved ones
Costco Wholesale,Cashier,5,Super easy job that pays pretty well. A lot of options to move up in the company. Depending on your coworkers it's a fun job that pays the bills. Also has GREAT benefits.
Costco Wholesale,Machine Operator,5,"Absolutely love employees and supervisors, but be ready to be physically drained every day. Pay is great along with building hours, but schedule can become finicky and superiority is very important there. "
Costco Wholesale,Sales Associate,5,I was okay working there and can always return if given a chance at a higher level.It is a good company good health care insurance and also the management know what they were doing 
Costco Wholesale,Commis d'entrepôt,4,Very well nothing to complain about.Training offered.Good team spirit.Schedule known in advance.Good wages and advantages.I recommend it to everyone.

Costco Wholesale,AM Stocker,5,Great benefits and pay for what we do. It’s fast paced. A downside is there’s no accountability for those that slack off so others are expected to step up
Costco Wholesale,Cart Pushing,3,Management doesn’t listen to your opinion. They only listen to the higher ups and never question them so whatever they say goes. Always being supervised. But the pay is good. Great people there able to help you with anything you need.
Costco Wholesale,Caissière,2,pas de respect des horaires!!! favoritisme et  très exigent physiquement aussi très gros roulement d employé !!!!décevant !!!!!!!!!!ne recommande pas cet emploi
Costco Wholesale,Cashier,3,What is the best part of working at the company?Decent pay raises …that’s all really. There is nothing else super great about working here.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The fact that being a lead makes you a glorified supervisor with no extra incentives like better pay or more opportunities to grow. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful and not equally distributed. You are expected to do more working certain shifts while other shifts aren’t expected nearly as much out of them.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful and frustrating. There is always so much that needs to be done but only certain people are held accountable for it therefor placing the burden on others to get it done in it’s entirety.
Costco Wholesale,Supervisor,5,"""A fantastic place to work with an incredible team! The people here are not only talented but also genuinely supportive, creating an environment that is both collaborative and inspiring. If you're looking for a workplace that values innovation and teamwork, this is the place to be!"""
Costco Wholesale,Tire Installer,4,"Pay is good, benefits are great.  Huge disconnect between management and employees now as a company. Not specifically at this warehouse ... but the company has experienced a cultural shift in the last ten years. "
Costco Wholesale,Cashier Assistant,3,"cannot complain about the pay, plus there are regular raises after a certain period of time. As part of the student program, we were kind of bottom of the barrel. no consistent schedule, shift changes at the last minute, and hours often get cut. you almost never have your break on time and we were almost always short-staffed. they have KPI's for you to meet but inadvertently sabotage your work because of their lack of employees. you will end up doing everything, not just the job you signed up for. most of my co-workers and the pay were what kept me at this job for as long as I was."
Costco Wholesale,Accounting Management,5,"The code of ethics is in the bones of the company, pay is fair and regularly assessed, and leadership is open to ideas and opinions. Definitely runs effectively, and it is necessary to have a strong work ethic."
Costco Wholesale,Brand Ambassador ,5,A typical day at work is setting up my demos table stand for unsuspecting customers I learned each rask is to be handle with care and it was so diverse and culturally glorified until it was an Amazing experience the hardest part of my job was standing for 8 hours you couldn't lean bend or sit down the enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people 
Costco Wholesale,Member Service Representative,4,Has a lot of people I’m sure you’ll fit in somewhere just not a very organized place and has a couple of management problems but overall a pretty good job with good pay and benefits and guaranteed hours
Costco Wholesale,Front End Cashier,4,Good company to work for but you will be overworked in when sales are low and they are not giving hours. But if you put in the hours your pay will get better and management is pretty good for the most part 
Costco Wholesale,Membership Clerk,4,"Overall I loved Costco. it was my first job and I could not be more grateful for the opportunity. you have good benefits, meet a lot of people, and have so many perks. However, it is a seniority-based company so in old warehouses it would be hard to get your PTO the times you want it etc. "
Costco Wholesale,Intern,4,"Everyone is very welcoming and helpful. Many people have been working there for decades and have a lot of knowledge, but also due to their loyalty, there are many employees stuck in middle management who are not equipped to lead."
Costco Wholesale,Cashier,5,"Good, over not too bad. I like the products and the people. Work isn't too bar but it is what it appears to be. Not much more to say. All good over there"
Costco Wholesale,placeur costco,3,"5pm to midnight, i leaned time management, management over there is a joke atleast at the costco i worked, the only thing employees spoke about was costco, hardest part was the labor, non-stop. the friends and almost family like people i met working there."
Costco Wholesale,Sales Associate,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?The benefits are good. They offer good health insurance coverage, including eye care. The vacation time is very fair and the PTO is an added perk.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The company promotes young, inexperienced workers to supervisory roles. These people have very little work experience; no supervisory experience; and very poor communication skills. That takes seemingly simple tasks and creates stressful situations. The young, newly promoted supervisors usually develop attitude problems with their newfound power and authority.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Communication is poor because the people in positions requiring quality communication never have had experience in that area. Good communication skills are not innate; they are learned. This lack of ability creates difficulties, which fall to the workers on the floor. A good amount of disrespectful treatment of underlings by the newly anointed supervisors further adds to the stressful and depressing atmosphere.What is a typical day like for you at the company?My job is on the display floor so every day is different. Early morning shifts require setting up product displays on the floor. Other shifts throughout the day require dealing with members, cleaning display areas, and additional miscellaneous tasks as needed during the normal course of business. Late evening shifts include shutting down a department and getting it ready for the morning shift to set up the following day's displays."
Costco Wholesale,Food Service Worker,4,Great company to work for. Benefits were great. Co workers are friendly and hours were good. Start off as part time to get full time position. Benefits for both part time and full time.
Costco Wholesale,Auxiliar de fuente de sodas,5,"The salary is very good and paid overtime.The work environment was not very good with the management of that time, because there was a lot of favoritism. The complete shifts are 12 hours and in general the work was heavy"
Costco Wholesale,Cashier,2,Managers don’t care about you have to work a a minimum amount of hours a week and most of the time they reject your time off requests for no reason. Would not recommend working here 
Costco Wholesale,Costco brand ambassador ,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Nothing , they fired me for not being able to come in because of my face being swollen and I couldn’t eat drink or talk all I asked for was one sick day after having some teeth removed , really don’t recommend working here, the women who hired me was nothing but rude and fakeWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Easy job but rude staff.         ,What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Loud and unorganised           What is a typical day like for you at the company?Get ur station set it up and wait all day basically"
Costco Wholesale,Freezer stocker ,3,"If you have a family, Costco may not be the best option for you. Costco does not seem to care about its employees' family obligations. If you call out, even for a family emergency, you will be written up. They call it a ""CN counseling notice."" They say you must choose Costco first. They don't even accept doctors' notes when you provide one. There is alot of favoritism, and to move forward, you have to be friends with a manager or know someone. The pay and benefits are good; that is all I like about working with Costco."
Costco Wholesale,Stocker/Cashier,4,Sharp employees and great managers and workers I see this a high and professional work environment to grow and produce numbers  o was walking one day and. The people were happy to be there 
Costco Wholesale,Warehouse Worker,3,"To me pay was alright, hard to get full time, never appreciated to where its just the same work life daily. Management was fine but like the job is decent. "
Costco Wholesale,Front End Associate,3,"Keeps you busy, workers are friendly. I was part time seasonal for the holidays so their was definitely alot of hours given out. Co workers are friendly. Worst part of my job was pushing carts"
Costco Wholesale,Fleet Driver,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The best part of working at Costco for me is the strong sense of teamwork and the supportive work environment. The company really values its employees, offering good benefits and opportunities for growth. Plus, there's a certain satisfaction in knowing that you’re part of a large team that contributes to providing quality products and excellent service to customers. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?One of the most stressful parts of working at Costco, especially as a truck driver, can be dealing with tight schedules and heavy workloads. The pressure to meet deadlines while ensuring safe and efficient delivery can be intense. Additionally, navigating busy periods like holidays or sales events can add to the stress. Managing these demands while maintaining quality service requires a lot of focus and resilience. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Costco’s work environment and culture are generally positive and supportive. The company is known for its emphasis on treating employees well, which contributes to a collaborative and respectful atmosphere. Management tends to be approachable, and there’s a strong focus on teamwork and mutual support. The company promotes a culture of inclusivity and values employee feedback, which helps in maintaining high morale. They also provide competitive wages and benefits, which underscores their commitment to employee satisfaction. In terms of the physical environment, Costco stores and facilities are typically well-maintained and designed - more..."
Costco Wholesale,Front End Supervisor,5,"There never a dull moment! There's always something to do. Fast paced, high energy environment . Sometimes, the focus items will make you roll your eyes, sometimes the management will power trip. Same as any other company. "
Costco Wholesale,Food Court Associate,1,The probation period us soo hard to pass good luck  it's just very strict during ur probation period so make sure ur drawer  cause that's robbing the members and people leave their change all the time 
Costco Wholesale,Event Specialist,2,Great part time job for university students in the area. I worked from Friday-Sunday with a flexible schedule and an understanding supervisor of what I could handle while being full time student.
Costco Wholesale,Front End Associate,3,"As a younger new worker, management can be pretty bad, especially if on carts. They won’t send people out even if we have 2 rows or 2 people during a rush. You have to have hours for a vacation unlike other places where you can just schedule those days off with no pay. It’s okay but makes it hard sometimes to work around unless management is cool about it. Some coworkers can be rude sometimes but overall most are amazing. "
Costco Wholesale,Night merch,5,"Everything about this place is amazing. Management, coworkers, and overall life while working here. Best job I’ve ever had and I left on good terms and respected everyone in the warehouse. 11/10"
Costco Wholesale,Cashier,5,Costco is a great place to work. Management is better than a lot of other places I’ve worked and the work is decent as well as the people. Highly recommend.
Costco Wholesale,Sales Associate - Electronics Department,5,"Costco is an outstanding company to work for, provided you are prepared for the physical demands of the role. However, some locations would benefit from improved management and enhanced supervisory oversight"
Costco Wholesale,Membership Clerk,4,"Overall I loved Costco. it was my first job and I could not be more grateful for the opportunity. you have good benefits, meet a lot of people, and have so many perks. However, it is a seniority-based company so in old warehouses it would be hard to get your PTO the times you want it etc. "
Costco Wholesale,Major Sales,4,"Working in major sales at Costco is a generally positive experience, but it does come with its challenges. The company offers competitive pay and excellent benefits, including health insurance and retirement plans, which is a huge plus. The work environment is fast-paced, especially during busy seasons, and you're often on your feet, helping customers and meeting sales goals. There’s a strong sense of teamwork, and most colleagues are friendly and helpful.One downside is the repetitive nature of the job, which can become monotonous over time. Additionally, dealing with demanding customers and handling large volumes of stock can be stressful. Management is supportive but can sometimes be more focused on pushing sales numbers than employee well-being.Overall, if you're looking for a stable job with good benefits and don't mind the hustle of retail, Costco's major sales department is a solid, if not perfect, place to work."
Costco Wholesale,"Cajero, Servicio al Cliente",4,"Very good place to work, very good benefits and great salary for the hours you work if you are a student I recommend work since the half shift is 24 hours a week and two days of rest"
Costco Wholesale,Forklift Operator,4,"Stay busy and you will be good. Really enjoy what I do, being cross trained is a plus make you more valuable and if your part time it’s a good way to pick up hours. Never stop learning "
Costco Wholesale,Front end assistant ,3,Overall a good place to work. Be prepared for a chaotic shift  as there is little to no downtime with customers in and out of the store all day long. Overall a pretty good place to work. 
Costco Wholesale,Assistant Store Manager,3,You know when you go IN but never have idea when you will leave work.. I worked 13 years at Costco and 10+ years in management including supervisor/manager in a lot of departments and it's always been the same issue. You have 2 days off a week and they are not together so maybe a wednesday with a saturday and the work load is overwhelming..
Costco Wholesale,Front end assistant,1,"Don't work here, horrible experience, especially front end, you will have no one backing you up, everyone is constantly stressed from the busy numbers of customers. Management will never take any of your ideas or opinions into account. You are a low level employee and they have an American level system, you will probably never see the Manager after your first day. No room for improvements and working hard will never get you anywhere everyone gets same pay, even the lazy ones. Required to take abuse from customers and they are placed above you. Always threatened with disciplinary for minor mistakes, and definitely had a lot of favouritism and the icing on the cake it's almost impossible to take holiday days because of an awful system.Finishing shift and not being able to go home due you awful security system Only thing I enjoyed was when it was not busy so you can spend your money in the food court, they had no good health options in the vending machines in the canteen so there was no choice, especially with the strict clock in clock out lunch system "
Costco Wholesale,Food Court Associate,2,Management is awful. Constantly changing my schedule and never notifying me. If your a good worker prepare to get abused and expected to pick up everyone else's slack. Always having to work through my 15 min break. 
Costco Wholesale,Front End,5,Loved the people I worked with and as long as you stay busy and always have a smile and treat members good then you will be a great employee for Costco 
Costco Wholesale,"Lancaster, PA",3,"I got a call from them about a month after I applied on their website. The hiring manager asked me if I would consider working seasonal employment on nights and weekends for September through December. I asked what happened after that and he told me they do reviews on what needs they have and if bringing someone on full time could be a possibility. I'm sorry, but this is just not fair to a person who is looking for work. I have a family who I would never see for four months as my spouse works and children go to school. There are no guaranteed hours or benefits during this timeframe. There is no guaranteed job lined up at the end of the busy holiday season. It really sounds like they are bringing people on to suit them and not to consider the employee in the long run. Many of us have lives outside of work and I am not going to be a part of a company who does not consider that."
Costco Wholesale,Bakery Team Member,3,"I just got hired after 3 rounds of interview for a bakery wrapper position. The interviewers were nice and firm. I got curious about the probationary period as it's the first time I've heard of it. Some tips I've read and got are to never be late, never call in (sick, or etc emergencies), and to always ask questions. I'll see what I will be dealing with on the orientation this week. They also called in that I will be working straight after orientation."
Costco Wholesale,Membership,4,"Great pay and bonuses. Can be busy at times and there is never a moment where you're not doing something. Four free memberships if you work there, paid time and a quarter on weekends which is nice "
Costco Wholesale,Bakery Wrapper,3,"The job is good, it keeps you busy but they are very strict with time management, appearance, and your ability to do your job effectively. The training is very good, and there are many opportunities to change and grow."
Costco Wholesale,Management,5,I started at the lowest level in the warehouse and within a couple months was at full time. Always paid well and was able to have paid holiday time after the first year.Stayed for many years and even made it to management in different parts of the building. Had the opportunity to open 2 building and work in 3 different buildings. Overall a great experience/ 
Costco Wholesale,Deli Clerk,3,"Paid and benefits are the best. You have to work your way from part-time to full-time. Good thing is they give minimum 25hrs (5days 5hours) for PT and you can ask other departments for hours. Bad thing is you may take more than a year (on average) to get a FT position. I worked at Deli where demands were so high and unrealistic from the top. It is quite physical and you literally on the run all the time. Sometimes will leave you alone hoping you can get everything done in those hours. When you did not, they gave you a talk. When you have to lower the standard same as others more ""senior"" to get things done in time, you get a talk. They have a pass to lower standard, but you don't. So it is pretty stressful but I would say for some people it is worth it by the pay. I would suggest Costco to everyone but not Deli in Costco. Other departments just pay a bit less but way more stress free. Unfortunately, that's why they almost always only have openings in Deli because Deli people would try their best to transfer to other departments. People are very pleasant to work with so it helps. One last thing worth to mention, I heard and saw stories about workers were rushed to get things done and got hurt. The management tried to blame workers ""not being careful / not following safety rules"" when in the first place they gave direct instructions workers not to follow those safety rules. When someone is injured, they don't like them being slow."
Costco Wholesale,接客スタッフ　事務　配送,3,"Working at this company, please tell me what you think is the best, there are many annual holidays, you can take it as a transfer holiday on holidays, basically overtime is not allowed, and overtime pay is available in 1 minute.It's not white, but welfare is as soon as a white manager, and it's the best part -time worker working at this company, and what is the most stressful top -down company in a top -down company?Absolutely, the rules will change, and if you don't like your boss, please tell me about the work environment and culture of this company. The name is for first name +, there is no hourly wage system, there is no bonus.Please tell me the flow of the day of working in the company. Please do what you said in a complete shift work, and depending on the department, the work style is completely different, so some departments have a lot of work."
Costco Wholesale,Meat Cutter,4,"It’s a blast if you get in the right department. Meat department is the best. You’re behind closed windows, not a crazy amount of member interactions. "

Costco Wholesale,Temporary Seasonal Worker,2,"Worked like a dog,  trained new employees and was shown the door after season ended. When i asked why,  they couldn't give me a straight answer.

Costco Wholesale,Floor Lead,1,"The leadership is beyond toxic,  they aren’t there to bring value to the company. It’s about helping their friends and kissing the behind of anyone to get a leg up. Poor quality of management/work."

Strict metrics designed to make you fail.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic and inconsistent, enjoy getting screamed at the phones multiple times a week.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Back to back calls with hardly a breath in between, expected to monitor email and chat messages, but can’t be looking at things unrelated to the call you’re on."
The Cigna Group,Healthcare Advocate,4,What is the best part of working at the company?They supply the equipment for working remotely and they pay for the business Internet.

It’s a constant learning.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?I work from home and there’s always constant communication between the employees and the supervisors is actually pretty good. The benefits are really good also and I guess I had to say one thing about it. That was negative was they don’t pay enough for what you do.but hey It’s a job. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Turning on your computer setting up the programs that you need to have up and getting your first call
The Cigna Group,Customer Engagement Specialist,5,"Coworkers in the same team are rather helpful, but the medical approval and claims team are not helpful in making their decisions transparent and not customer-focused.

The Cigna Group,Claims Processor,2,"I thought it was gonna be a good job but I was wrong. The first three months you spend training is basically two weeks hands on and three months of working 5 claims a day to be told what you did wrong at the end of the day. Then being thrown to the wolves to achieve 75-100+ claims a day and constantly be micromanaged and forced into throwing coworkers under the bus for making human errors. You aren’t allowed to take more than 5 minutes to process a claim, if you do be prepared to have a script written and documentation explaining exactly why it took you that long. You’ll also be questioned about absolutely every move you make. And be expected to explain why you made the errors you made even though they expect you to read a book for every claim and basically memorize guidelines that change ever couple weeks. Do you have to go to the restroom? You better hold it until your break because going to the bathroom on the clock is looked down upon. If you’re working claims be prepared to read 5 pages of dos and donts on every single code you process. And don’t dare make a mistake they expect 99-100% accuracy at all times after your first 3 months of working and not training. They have no issue enforcing their unrealistic quality and quota expectations. Every meeting with your manager will make you feel terrible about yourself and kill your self esteem. Oh wait I forgot the best part, 90% of your mistakes will be addressed 3 months after their made and count against your current month of performance review. So that 90 day grace period learning curve they give you will go right out the - more..."
The Cigna Group,Customer Service Representative,5,"There is advancement on who knows who and who they like its not for everybody regardless how skilled or educated you are.

The Cigna Group,Customer Advocacy,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Nothing.  The company does not care about employees only making high metrics scores and money.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The rude customers and again trying to make high metrics  that are sometimes hard to reach.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Depends on the supervisors  and team. I've been fortunate to  have a good supervisor  and be on 2 good teams.
The Cigna Group,Intake Representative,5,Fast paced environment. Very intense at times. Learning curve was a bit rough but once you made it around the bend you were good. Effective  training.

The Cigna Group,CSR - Customer Service Representative,1,Working from home a lot of system issues through out the day can get real annoying at time they are based of a QA goal so if you don’t meet that goal they will let you go the manager will do nothing to keep your job overall not really a good company to work for the pay for everything you do is well not worth it 
The Cigna Group,Customer Service Advocate,2,I loved the pay but overall it was a horrible experience! The training was horrible and there was no one to help you! They moved on so quickly while training that you weren’t able to retain the knowledge before they let you out to start answering calls. And they literally watch every thing you and you are graded on everything. You couldn’t even have a conversation with someone on web chat/ask them for help without your supervisor knowing and you’d get a phone call from them. The micro-managing was at an all time high! You were not valued in your position bc they are constantly hiring and you could easily be replaced. To say it was a stressful work environment is an understatement. I left there with my anxiety at an all time high. 
The Cigna Group,Home Infusion Nurse,4,"Compared to other infusion jobs, there is more required charting and pay is +$20 less per hour than many other companies. The positive benefit is pay from door to door plus mileage reimbursement but this doesn't make up for the lost $20/hr. I've been doing home infusions for 6 years and have never had this amount of charting required at each visit (which is weekly, so very extensive for someone who was seen 1 week prior). POTs every 2 months, which were only once a year with my other company. No way to order supplies needed for the infusions without calling their 1-800 number. Managers are helpful and friendly but seem to be highly overworked. I've heard many say, please don't quit, it does get easier (about the charting), so it sounds like this happens frequently. It is ALOT.  The charting system is complicated. They provide an iPad but then have you us a VPN app to log onto a windows desktop to access EHR. It's not user-friendly at all and if you let the screen timeout it logs you off and you have to go through the 8-minute log in process all over again. There are like 3-4 other apps you have to learn (mostly on your own) and some you can only access through the VPN app/windows desktop thing, it's annoying and incredibly slow. The company provides supplies and equipment for the job and has some benefits like 401K, etc. But because this job isn't a 1099/contract position, like most other home infusion jobs, you cannot write off as much (you end up paying more in taxes for doing the same job). "
The Cigna Group,Implementation Manager,5,"It's a very high-paced environment, and with the Implementation job, time off is very limited in the 4th quarter (Oct-Dec). Training is very thorough, and management is a cheerleader for your success. Need to have a great understanding of benefits and an ability to effectively juggle competing high priorities."
The Cigna Group,Claims Examiner,5,The income was appropriate for the job position of Claims Examiner I. I worked 8 to 5. I worked in a building with only one level. I reviewed claims and submitted them for payment. I do not remember my maximum Great place to work.
The Cigna Group,Strategy Director,4,"I learned so much working at Cigna and made some great work friends. The work is challenging if you want it to be. I moved from a Technical Writer to a Director during my tenure and then randomly and unexpectedly was let go without a real reason aside from ""your role is being eliminated, this is not performance-based"". That said, I enjoyed my time at Cigna but with a company that size, you're just a number."

The Cigna Group,Certified Pharmacy Technician,1,"If you can help it! PLEASE DO NOT WORK HERE. The way the supervisors talk to employees and how they manage them is completely vile and unfair! If you care about being treated fairly and with respect, I highly recommend you try elsewhere!"
The Cigna Group,CSC,1,"Well, as an outsourced third party employee, I can assure you, as a client, they’re awful. Micromanagement is an understatement. More insecurity than a teenage relationship. You are monitored EVERYWHERE. I can understand HIPAA compliance, fully. But here? You’re nothing more than a number, an easily replaceable cog in a machine for insurance. They don’t care about you at all. "
The Cigna Group,Prior Authorization Specialist,5,"Cigna is a great company, benefits are top tier. But the back to back phone calls are horrible—and waiting a year to transfer to another department is ridiculous. You barely have time to breathe in between calls and will get penalized for taking unscheduled breaks, which hurts your quarterly bonus. Unless you really enjoy talking on the phone, do not apply for any intake positions. It is a high call volume. However, All the workers I’ve encountered have been nice. My manager is amazing! I am a people person, but I am in the wrong position. I’m currently trying to wait for a year, but also am seeking other companies as well.  The most enjoyable part is that I work from home, other than that …I am over it! "
The Cigna Group,Utilization Review RN,1,"I have 25 years in. It was a nice place.. In the last 2 years management has taken any dignity away.  There is no work life balance. Professionals are treated like assembly line workers. There is constant pressure to do more.Workers  have to report to the office for no reason. Every second of your day is monitored. If there is a computer outage you forfeit PTO.  If your out of time you maybe terminated. If you are not performing of  ""producing"" you may be terminated.  There is pressure to issue denials."
The Cigna Group,Pharmacy Technician,3,Barely talked to any manager when I worked here. I worked from home but it would’ve been better with more help. Nobody really knew how to reach out to other employees for better understanding of your job for the day.

The Cigna Group,CSA - Customer Service Associate,1,Job is very micromanaging. You will work for the pay. The benefits are wonderful but I was let go out of the blue without any warning. Expect to be questioned about everything you do. I only went to work because it paid my bills but the pay is not worth it. 
The Cigna Group,Medicare Advocate,1,The most stressful part is having a supervisor that has little or no experience with politics and doesn’t abide with them. The department can make their own rule and can leave when they feel they haven’t something important to do. There is no diversity and help is rare. The training instructors do not want the employees helping each other or nor do they assist you. The overwhelming calls with little to no help. Promoting is a joke when the department can keep you from moving to another role. 
The Cigna Group,Pharmacy Clerk,2,This is very good company to work for it has good benefits 401k and you work 4 days 10 hour shifts and 3 days off. Has overtime and there is room to grow.

The Cigna Group,Call Center Agent,1,"Company has been implementing cost cutting measures for a long time.This includes understaffing, making employees work longer hours or less pay or removing benefits as well as cutting benefits that DO exist.  Currently management is putting everyone who is on work from home on PIPs.  This includes stellar workers who ARE or WERE vital to operations.  For your own safety and sanity, it is best to avoid this underpaid, overworked and abusive company.  "
The Cigna Group,Billing and Eligiblity Administrator,4,"I originally worked full time from home during the pandemic, however as the rules lifted, this was still an option and it was great for saving money on travel and for family life. Eventually the job become hybrid 2 days a week and still great.Lots of support, busy days but your day passes quickly, people are great and the managers have great communication with staff, great performance bonus every year, although the pay is not great, the company is still very supportive with £8 allowance in the office canteen that can be used for breakfast and lunch.Environment is generally positive, I enjoyed coming to work with Cigna, don't get me wrong there were days I could have cried but they were very far a few between."
The Cigna Group,Customer Service Advocate⁹,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Zero stars for all working conditions.

The Cigna Group,Pharmacy prior authorization customer service representative ,5,"Excellent training, manager of my department let me go and I cried for months and wish I would be able to have a second chance. I  am a very honest person that was misunderstood and honestly let go unfairly. It’s important for me to have my career back at Cigna. I believe there is something inside us all that is better than any obstacle. Every day is a challenge there, but I knew that from the start I would like to start over and get my job back. Learning more and getting a degree in this field of work would actually help more and I am actually working in the process of doing that now. I’ve dedicated the last year to staying at home getting a little frustrated, but I really really need to have my job. It is very important for me to be a successful mother, healthy mother "
The Cigna Group,CSR - Customer Service Representative,1,"The most stressful job I have ever worked in my life- the pay just doesn’t equate to the amount of mental stress you have to endure on a daily- I’m literally looking into receiving mental counseling after working here- when I get off I have to take a nap because I’m mentally exhausted just dealing with this company their whiney annoying self entitled customers, not to mention nothing is streamlined here- u have to go through various systems just to find the most simple information- I’ve never hated a job more than I hate Cigna in my life, now I will admit I have a very good supervisor but every thing else sucks "
The Cigna Group,Senior Advisor,2,"Culture has changed traumatically over the last year.  Employees are constantly nervous about layoffs and autonomy has been removed from them.  There are really good people to work with, but many are just held back by archaic leadership decisions."
The Cigna Group,Agile Product Management Senior Analyst,4,Management expects you to be regularly working over 40 hours a week.  No work/life balance support. Express Scripts is under Evernorth/Cigna which claims they encourage their employees to be healthy but I see people regularly working 12+hour days AND weekends and I've been expected to put in the same commitment even when I complete my work within the regular 9-5 schedule. 
The Cigna Group,Eligibility Specialist,2,"Training from the start was a trainwreck!! Login issues since day 1 and no real structure in training. The “trainers” are employees that they pull to help and not actual trainers with training. Those same “trainers” still have their own work to do on top of training the new hire class. So with that being said, they are juggling both their own work (and metrics) plus the new hire material. They read straight off the screen and expect us to know what all abbreviations/work jargon mean. The training is not long enough for the amount of material that new hires are expected to learn. Management after training barely helped because they were so swamped with their own work. It felt like we were the thrown to the wolves. After 6 months still had no idea how to do the job efficiently. Benefits were decent and hours were typical M-F. At the end, I just clocked in and did nothing for weeks (gotta get paid) until my new job started. "
The Cigna Group,Management,2,"Fact of the matter is people are scared of executive leadership and HR.  If it's not the layoffs it's the constant reorgs and change of company policies to shift towards a more toxic working environment.  They are forcing everyone back into an office that is over crowded, distracting, and toxic because people don't know if they are going to be laid off or fired anymore.   Executive leadership doesn't care about anyone below director level.  "
The Cigna Group,Electrical Maintenance Technician,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Nothing supervisors are rude and disrespectful show up hours late and then write you up for being 1 min late also lots of unnecessary drama over non work related things What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The drama and pettiness of management.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Drama filled unprofessional people and behavior What is a typical day like for you at the company?Exhausting trying to work through all the drama problems and gossip

The Cigna Group,Claims Representative,1,The pay is horrible people come in making more money than those already there. Very under paid and undervalued. Advancements is a long way away.

The Cigna Group,ACCREDO RN specialty infusion,3,"IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO GET THE HOURS YOU WERE HIRED FOR.No one mentioned anything during the interview. You can be hired for a 40 hour work week and only work 20. This will likely happen frequently and other employees on my team had the same experience.

The Cigna Group,Registered Nurse,2,"The company leadership likes to talk about how much they care about work/life balance, burnout, having a healthy culture, etc. but they are ALL talk. The policies do not align with this at all. Everything and everyone is extremely micromanaged. Well-educated professionals are monitored every minute of the day. They are not happy unless staff are incredibly overworked, but will talk about how much they care about your health and well-being. As a supervisor, I'm not able to be a good leader because I'm forced to align with policies I do not agree with. "
The Cigna Group,Customer Service Advocate,1,"Management does not care about you. They only care about their “numbers.” Management and supervisors have ZERO communication. Even when questions are taking to their bosses boss, you get no answer. They do not care if you are sick, hospitalized or have a family emergency. There are job openings with YOUR TITLE for $5 more an hour. You are constantly micromanaged. Only pro would be wfh and the benefits"
The Cigna Group,Quality Coach,3,I had been an employee for 8 years. Was laid off and returned in a lesser position (that worked for me). In the years there I saw us go from customer focused to numbers focused and realized this was no longer the company I wanted to retire from. 
The Cigna Group,Medical Assistant/Phlebotomist,1,"I worked in the Lab Department at the Chandler location as a MA/Phlebotomist, the lab department itself was a really good fit for me but the toxicity and unprofessional environment from the registration desk really mad me leave.

The Cigna Group,"QUALITY REVIEW LEAD ANALYST, LEVEL 1 AUDITOR",5,"The work is interesting, compensation is good, PTO is good, management is very helpful. Overall a great place to work. The only drawback is there are no part time positions, and you are not allowed to work outside the US. "
The Cigna Group,CSR - Customer Service Representative,5,I had a great experience at Cigna . The training is enough to get you going but you do learn mostly everything once you’re out doing your job.

The Cigna Group,Broker Manager,5,Great place to work and a lot of room for growth! Great team and supportive management. My role allowed me to work from home a few days out of the week.
The Cigna Group,Lead Financial Analyst,1,Management is totally absent and incompetent. There is no commitment to building and promoting employees. Responsibilities are distributed at random and there is no thought around equal division of work.
The Cigna Group,Certified Pharmacy Technician,1,This company had poor management bc your boss will hardly communicate with you and fire you instantly for talking to any peers.. I agree with all the reviews listed for this job.

The Cigna Group,CSR - Customer Service Representative,1,Cigna  constantly listen to inbound and outbound calls. The supervisor rarely helps you succeed at the company.  You are required to work all holidays. Cigna does not care about you or your family. Horrible company to work for!!!!
The Cigna Group,Bilingual Customer Service Representative,5,"I couldn’t pass the training classes, or I learn to slow for this job, or is too much information to learn in short period of time. Besides that, the main trainer is very patient. You learn, very fast, is a great place to work because you have that support. In my side, I couldn’t take the pressure."
The Cigna Group,Customer Service Representative,1,Lots of stress. Low pay. Expected to do the work of multiple people. No help from upper management. The departments don't communicate with each other. No job security. People are vanishing. The perfect word to describe working here is insanity.

The Cigna Group,Customer Service Advocate,5,"Training was easy, managers there to help you and fully knowledgeable, job was easy if you paid attention to the training.

The Cigna Group,Trainee,2,"I was hired into the company. However, received no training. Most companies give you a mentor to assist, but the mentor did not want to be bothered. Therefore, I had no one to help me.  I would not recommend this company to anyone unless Cigna  put in writing they will train you and hold MANAGEMENT accountable. If you go work for Cigna and within a month or two if you see they will not train you so that you can be successful and soar in the company, please leave!"
The Cigna Group,Customer Service,1,Customer service- This job is the most mentally draining job I've ever worked at. I've cried probably a thousand times working here and I have tough skin. I constantly feel like they focus on what you do wrong more than praising you for the good. They have unrealistic expectations. Don't get me started on the nit picking they do. Not only do you have the abuse from the customers but you also get the constant quality and grilling from your uppers. This is the worst job I've ever worked at in my 20 years of working! I've never in my life had a job make me feel like I can't do anything right. 😭😭 If you want to keep your sanity I suggest you don't do it! Also the benefits are not that great the deductible is insanely high!!
The Cigna Group,Telephonic Complex Nurse Case Manager,1,"The caseload is unmanageable. The customers hate Cigna and take it out in case managers who are more like glorified telemarketers. Cigna has some shady business practices, just look it up. There is no consistency from one manager to the next. Pay is good but it's salaried and I put in way more hours just trying to keep up with the caseload.  "
The Cigna Group,Manager,4,"Culture could be clique-y, networking is required to advance and grow career. Good benefits and pay if you negotiate well (you should always negotiate). "
The Cigna Group,Claims Processor,5,I just recently been hired on to the company looking forward to seeing where it would lead me. I work Monday through Friday 8:00 am -4: 30 pm. I work from home so the culture is great. I don't have to interact with customers and all of my equipment was provided.
The Cigna Group,Customer Service Representative,5,I really liked working with this company. Great supportive staff with a  good call volume. I decided to leave the company due to health issues. But I’d recommend this company to anyone who’s interested in health insurance. 
The Cigna Group,Plan Implementation Senior Representative National Ancillary,3,"2 breaks and 30 minutes lunch break.  Management was unfair in moving people ahead.  Had to have a degree in something to go past a certain level, even if you had the skills.  Most managers had favorites on the team.  The hardest part of the job was overworking the lower bands and letting the higher bands not carry their workload.   I was told on a Thursday my job was eliminated with no time to look for something else.  The most enjoyable part was working from home so if the weather was bad or wasn't feeling 100% I could still work.  Also didn't have to be around a lot of people who were sick and spreading germs."

Just do what you’re suppose to do and everything will get easier. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Only stressful part is meeting your metrics every month and hitting your bonus. I feel like your only good as your last month. It gets easier as you get familiar with the job and the different systems. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Everyone is professional and willing to help. I haven’t had any problems with anyone. It’s fun sometimes and every one help each other to become successful. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Boring sometimes. Back to back calls. Problem solving. Sometimes it could get hectic on busy days. I like when it’s busy because the time flies faster.
The Cigna Group,Sales Support Specialist,2,"I got hired on from a temp company. Recruiter is inconsistent and not helpful as before. Answering agent calls to assist with clients, it was hard at first then became easy. Some questions get asked that we weren’t thoroughly trained on.  It’s winter time and they have the cold air blowing all day long, so we’re sitting at a cold desk for 8 hours no matter how wrapped up in clothes you are. Training was unorganized from day one and rushed when it came to the last day.  It was a supervisor who  micromanaged  and team leads who took things too seriously. The lunches are very short, you can’t even walk away too long w/o being notified after a certain time frame, it’s a typical corporate job. Know what you’re signing up for, This one I wouldn’t recommend to anybody."

The Cigna Group,Business Project Advisor,5,"Mostly Good and supportive team members, Some were territorial but it was  easy to spot who was friend or foe, even regardless  of everyone being faceless voices. That was the major con- Pretty much every meeting was camera off so being truly personable was difficult. The socializing effort was often ignored by most despite the managers’ effort. Overall budget constraint caused a damper on little things that can really make a team feel some spark and joy. No money for Christmas gifts, team party, team building, in-person PI meetings etc. ah well, but otherwise, great and passionate team members who knew what they where doing and wanted to get on with it and remove “busywork.” In the end all (most) saw the great  value to initially tedious project tracking techniques. "
The Cigna Group,Senior Leader and Advisor for Data Governance and Management Strategy,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?When  my day was over.  Horrible communication and a gas lighting narcissistic boss.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?A team who was clueless of it's purpose, and had very little or no experience with Governance. The person  who  led the team was a micro manager, gas lighting, critical person, who also lacked management and governance skills.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It is a ""yes"" organization.  Huge clicks and if you were an individual not in the click watch your backside.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Absolutely confusing because our entire team was clueless."
The Cigna Group,Warehouse Associate,1,People are allowed to go in and not work. Management has no guts to say anything. They keep the bad and the good leave. Stay clear as there's no leadership or direction  at this place. Don't know how the place stays operational and they fill people's medications. Pretty scary!!

Microsoft,Technical Advisor,4,Coolest company to work for. Super exciting hiring experience. Phenomenal top-tier benefits. Great experience…until it wasn’t.

Microsoft,Principal Product Manager (Growth),5,"I was only bored like...once or twice a year? Work is always changing, lots of growth, really smart people. I worked on exciting projects and had a lot of autonomy. The words and actions at the leadership level are not in alignment too often. We continue to quasi-support too many things rather than really focusing on specific things and in terms of equity, there's been a lot of progress but don't count on reporting issues to change anything. HR focuses more on likelihood of litigation not supporting those with issues."

Microsoft,Data Center Technician,2,A typical day at work looks simple. With completing tickets and going to meetings. The main thing is hitting your metrics. That can be tedious and frustrating at times. I learned a good amount from working on servers. I’ve definitely developed more on my hardware skills. The management is okay and there. I like my manager for the most part. The workplace culture is wishy washy at best. The hardest part of my job? Would be dealing with colleagues. The most enjoyable part of my job? Would be learning something new almost everyday!
Microsoft,Data Center Technician,2,"I haven’t had the greatest experience. I wouldn’t deter anyone else from going and trying Microsoft out. As a POC, there are some noticeable discriminatory practices in place, and nepotism is very real within the work culture. You will learn a lot, the growth mindset is an optimistic approach to work life. The core values aren’t as valued, as this campus in Cheyenne likes to make them out to be. "
Microsoft,Software Engineer Intern,4,Really enjoyed my team! Had some team game nights and my fellow interns were super helpful and fun to talk to. Intern project was something that they'd give to a full-time engineer so it was great to have a real project.
Microsoft,Senior Technical Account Manager,4,"Tools required to do your daily work we're awful and added to the stress.  Great people to work with and to learn from.  You could perform well, but job security was still non existent."
Microsoft,Editor,3,Could be better in terms of company culture but overall not a bad place to work. I have liked my time there but it's time to move on and find a better place to work.
Microsoft,Manager,4,"Pro: Pay and benefits above market standard. Colleagues are generally helpful and friendly. For direct hires, caliber of employees is way better than many companies. A lot of learning opportunities and get to work with very smart people.Cons: If supervisor is based in APAC, work life balance tends to be better. Else expect late evening and early morning calls when having meetings involving US. There are also contractors converted to MS employees, caliber tends to be average. As company staff strength is huge, some employees get away with murder and do not pull their weight and leverage on more diligent colleagues to deliver their share of work. Their managers that don’t feel comfortable calling out such behaviours, due to fear of retribution from these problematic staff in 360 appraisal (staff giving managers bad ratings which the skip level managers can see). Hard to weed out as appraisal system is based on positive impact, instead of criticism. "
Microsoft,Fleet MGR,5,Granugar to work.Good balance and family.Highly recommended.Due to move I had to leave the company.The only disadvantage is that it is difficult to climb.
Microsoft,CS,5,"Flexible work schedule, accountability focused and easy access to speak with higher-ups.ConsSlightly less competitive pay compared to other large companies."
Microsoft,Engineer,4,To end up working with talented staffs and lots of creative atmosphere. Salary was also good. Toughest part of life is job is very demanding. Diversity and inclusion is very high

Microsoft,Support Escalation Engineer,5,Great place to work. Good work life balance depending on which team. big company so it has everything other big companies have. you get what you want if you plan ahead. and if you know what you want you can get it.
Microsoft,Senior Systems Operations Engineer,4,"Working at Microsoft was a dream come true that turned into a nightmare. Everything about working at Microsoft was amazing, except for the review system and the problems it creates.Your review has nothing to do with your actual performance. It's how well your boss is able to fight for scores to give to their team, and that goes all the way up the ladder. If an org is on the chopping block, that org is going to get mostly bad scores to give out, which means there will be very few good scores available, which means by the time it gets to the team leads, their team is going to get screwed. Leads would literally tell their people to find other teams to join before review time so their score could come out of another bucket (though even that's dicey sometimes as someone new in an org, but generally much safer than staying put).The internal politics are ruthless. Absolutely everything else is amazing. "
Microsoft,Data Center Technician,5,Microsoft is a great company to work for. Great training. Great pay. Great benefits. Very safety oriented. Very big on training and not throwing people into trials by fire. Lots of opportunity for advancement. This has been my favorite employer and job I've had.As an fte for site services I do work 12 hour days with a normal schedule of 3 days 1 week and 4 the next. However with optional OT available I tend to do 60+ hours a week there. Time flies when your having fun.I don't feel like I'm being lied to or placate when it comes to advancements and opportunities here. Way different than past employers.Even though it's one of the biggest companies in the world I feel heard a d that my contributions are important.

Cardinal Health,Machine Operator,1,"this job is horrible. you’re better off finding something else. they’re strict about you being even a minute late which isn’t that big of a deal for me, the big deal is  they can’t keep people for a reason, everyone there hates there job no ones shows up for work you have to watch others machines and yours while they’re on break. the machines are junk and always malfunction so you’re never able to get the amount you want done. it’s super loud in there! you’ll go to sleep hearing the machines and beeping it’s awful. they’re also super rude  and not safe. they don’t have a proper trainee to insure safety.

The work is easy, productivity standards are mixed. Some days are good, some are bad.. the only people truly always hitting their numbers are those who break safety rules and make quality errors. I used to love this place, but since the new management came it.. it’s fear based leadership now. So many people are unhappy here."

Cardinal Health,VL Dock Shipper,1,The two years I have been working at this company well very toxic Supervisors are with leads and leads are with employees There's been so many counts of favoritisms And when you ask for help from a supervisory sometimes they will and sometimes they will not help you out with this situation you've been asking for a one and a half year to get out of They only pay you 23 an hour but they pay more of their new employees instead of their older employees You do get holiday payWill work overtime a lot

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?You get alot of vacation but never get to take what you want becasue your waiting on 7 people who been there 15 years to pick theres.  They all go before you and your left with days no ome wants. Can only take a week at a time. No days here and there. Supervisor is never involved in what's going on in the wearhouse. Only comes out when he's boss comes out to make it look like he's in the loop. Bravo points where we or rewarded? Dont count on that. They never give out no matter how much you help out.Raises. Lol. Count on 25 cents to 35 no more. I've heard of one person getting a 5 cent raise when I started. Hr is no not in the building and hard to get ahold of. They have email and phone number but very hard to get a hold of someone. They will hire new people making more then you even though you been there years on in and they think you will never find out. Not saying all of things to be negative. Just they need to work on some things. It's a job if you need a job for a couple years. Not for the long term.   They want you to learn new machines and other things in the wearhouse but don't want to pay what your worth. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Get up early head to work go home.

Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate,3,"I wanna clarify, that I consider myself a good worker, always on time, never late, nor callout much unless otherwise. I would end up getting fired, this was a shock for me. From my experience I kept getting called to my supervisor office on these small mistakes when riding a P.I.T machine which eventually lead me to getting written up, (which is something you are required to be trained on). These small mistakes would be lead me getting let go & possibly considered me a danger to the work place. No names will be said but one of the workers who is a lead that I've talked to, told me in quote "" I don't know what it is, there must have been a change in the company rules cause it is alot more easy getting in trouble over small minor things... "", my point been made.Here's a few things to note, the job hours are all over the place, you can only go home when everybodys else is done in the warehouse so meaning you'll have days it can be 9-12 hour shift, from what I've been told winter time can be worst, 5 day a week job, with only 2 days off, the more callouts that given that day & how many orders will reflect. its a good way get a workout in, given how much you'll be lifting & yes some items can be heavy."

Cardinal Health,Engineer,2,This is a bad place to work.  Equipment is extremely ancient and in disrepair.  Building is unhygienic. Management does not allow for innovation or change.  Key roles at the director and manager level stay open for months. Budget constantly being cut.  People are treated as numbers.
Cardinal Health,EHS,4,"Coworkers are great and productive atmosphere. The issue is that you will be held accountable for the compliance of sites that you have no administrative control over. This will also affect your bonus. They will tell you different, but be warned."

Cardinal Health,"Associate II, Assembly",4,"Ive learned a lot in my time at this place and its just like any other job, it has its pros and cons. One thing i didnt like is that when i wanted to become a tech, they kept telling me that i had to wait for another coworker to train to become a tech. Another thing i didnt like was that they had switch from 4x10s to 5x8s and i didnt really find that conveniant because i only had a short amount of time to do what i had to do during the weekdays. With the 4x10s, i would have friday available if there was no mandatory overtime. "
Cardinal Health,Advisor,4,I've had good experience with my management but upper leadership feels distant and sends mixed messaging. Overall solid work/life balance. Would recommend for remote people. 
Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate,1,This company is run on favoritism. And new manger has came in and fired everyone that makes to much money. Save your self the headache go somewhere else. You can work harder and better then everyone and still be treated like garbage. This warehouse only has a handful of people that have worked there over 5 years. That should tell you something. They only care about money. 
Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Over all a great company to work with.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Noting specific to say ,just grow with the company .What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Good environment working together as a team.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Exciting overall everyday ,going so fast as well."
Cardinal Health,"Director, R&D",4,I really  liked the company culture. Their business is geared to high-volume medical devices with lower margins - was not a great fit with the unit I was working for.
Cardinal Health,Technicien biomédical,1,"Cardinal Health turns out to be an enormous structure devoid of soul and morality, particularly towards its itinerant biomedical technicians.This position is not only difficult and devalued, but also in chronic sub-employment with only two technicians for all of France.Employees are constantly traveling, spending their weeks on the road and in hotels.Worse, the company removes this position by economic dismissal to replace it with low-cost subcontractors, demonstrating total contempt for its employees and their well-being."
Cardinal Health,Delivery Driver,5,Wages are low. But overall a great place to work. They provide a car for delivery nuclear pharmacy meds. People there are awesome and management is easy to work with.
Cardinal Health,Warehouse Worker,3,I worked there for about 7 months from the start they lie about how many hours you work. I wanted 12 hour shifts instead I got 15+  3/4 days of the week. If you like overtime and getting maybe 6/7 hours of sleep after each shift it's a good job but if you want some free time to relax after work this place definitely doesn't offer it.After your last break 7 hours into the shift you are usually working 6-7 hours straight until you finish picking. 
Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate,1,"Management is terrible, will put a target on your back and have you out of the warehouse within a week. You could be the hardest worker but if they dont like you they get you removed."

Cardinal Health,Warehouse Worker,2,"Worked there for several years. Good learning experience. Very low pay, but good work. Was able to work my way up over the years but it did take a while."
Cardinal Health,Senior Customer Service Representative,3,"Stayed for almost two years until company decided to realign the pay, in short they promoted us agents, gave us higher pay and then after some time they realign our pay with those agents from the  Lower band.

Cardinal Health,Person,3,"Aspects of this job are reasonable, with the exception of any quarrels. You do not want to be involved with, or be at the mercy of Human Resources. In addition, the relay of information from management can be convoluted. This is partly a system issue, and partly dependent on the person supervising."
Cardinal Health,Customer Service Representative II,3,The company is stable and secure. Chill work phase. The salary is just fine. The only negative thing i can say is that the HR is very hard to reach. Asking for assistance is like begging.
Cardinal Health,Pharmacy Technician,2,"Management only cares about its pharmacists. B careful. You will always be in the wrong, even after having proof. The typical day is very repetitive so its an easy job, until they drain you and don’t allow you go to doctors appointments you requested a few months prior."
Cardinal Health,Picker,3,Long hours and lots of walking. Feet always hurt but the job wasn't that bad. Most co workers were easy to get along with. The pay is pretty good and they have good perks.
Cardinal Health,Sales Specialist,3,The overall workplace environment is great and the work life balance. The company training programs need to improve and constant organizational structure changes.

Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate II (Night Shift),2,"What is the best part of working at the company?It’s a legit and reputable companyWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management is uncompromising, condescending and could care less . Understand that you are Not an asset, Not appreciated, and Can easily be replaced.  THERE IS NO Work/Life balance. Injured, sick, or on your deathbed, you are expected at work. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?A Warehouse Sweatshop. Employees come a dime a dozen.  Be prepared to be shocked by the borderline “unlawful “ work practices. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work, work, work! 10 minute breaks and 1/2 hour lunch. Then it’s back to work!"
Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate,5,It is an extensive work without departure time many hours of overtime
Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate,1,Cardinal health in Montgomery can be the ideal place to work.Management needs a lot of improvements.They don't have human values they see people as disposables.Management creates an uncomfortable work environment 
Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate,3,"The hours are steady but overtime never feels feasible. Criteria for overtime can be frustrating because it can be difficult to complete metrics due to over staffed departments. Not only that work orders can be small and time consuming. Point system is stringent, associates can be put on final warning for any various reasons. "
Cardinal Health,Tap coordinator,3,"Team and people were good. The pay is ok and not much room for growth. Was hybrid while I was there, not sure how it is now. Overall good starter job.  "
Cardinal Health,Advisor,5,"Excellent place to work! I a truly grateful to have found such a great team, flexible hours, no micromanaging, excellent professionalism, camaraderie, excellent benefits."
Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate,1,Easy job terrible supervisors/managers wouldn’t recommend at all associates are fun easy going nice people overall but again the management is terrible as well as HR 
Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate/Forklift Operator,1,Do not apply for this company! I worked there for 2 years and you work hard to get no raises and the slackers and the people who do nothing get promotions. The lead hands are not good leaders they do nothing and don’t act like lead hands too much of daycare and high school with them gossip about other employees I was put in three different departments for receiving picking and small pack I did it all there and certain employees pick the bare minimum and get away with it when you work hard and I picked the most and they would complain they have favourites there with workers and smart people who think they know it all people bad mouth other employees behind there back Including the lead hands the inventory coordinator is a smart know it all and complains about if you do something minor and would walk around the warehouse acting like a manager it’s a joke of a place to work and a bunch of actors who pretend to work hard and get away cuz they fake it to the boss and leads. I would always hit numbers yet they would move me to different departments and other guys couldn’t hit numbers at all and stay in picking and certain guys would hit the bare minimum as long as you fake it there you make it but if you work hard you get in trouble not a very good company who values they are bullies the lead hands also they don’t treat you with respect at all

Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate,2,Work a lot of hours but check still comes out shortManagement only show up when its dealing with the company money or their bonusNo bonus or raises for employees No acknowledgement or appreciation for the employees Just clock in and make their moneyYou're basically working for nothing 
Cardinal Health,Manager,1,"Cardinal Health has experienced a significant decline over the past six years. Management appears to prioritize their own interests, displaying little loyalty to long-term employees. Pay raises have consistently been disappointing, with most employees receiving increases of 3% or less for over 15 years. Senior leaders enjoy substantial benefits, while lower-level staff are not adequately rewarded. Layoffs have been a continuous issue for over three years, occurring gradually to avoid making formal reduction-in-force announcements or filing age reports.It's worth questioning the amount spent on luxury suites at Nationwide Arena, Lower.com, and The Ohio State University Football Stadium. Additionally, it is rumored that the company holds courtside seats at the Schottenstein Center for OSU basketball games for senior executives. Meanwhile, employee reward programs and celebrations have been canceled, including Stock Purchase discount program, anniversary rewards, holiday celebrations, and BRAVO awards. Despite these cuts, the executives still enjoy their event and game tickets."
Cardinal Health,Pharmacist,1,"This place is very toxic, the manner lack management skills, pharmacist and techs never stay long. Barely train employees but expect for them to perform so well. Over worked and stressful. Everyone talk about each other behind their backs including the manager. You have been warned. That is why I left "
Cardinal Health,Pharmacist,5,Great opportunity to learn and grow in the field of pharmacy.  Great support team and the ability to reach and secure help when needed regarding challenging situations 
Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate,1,"This company is the worst, want you to work harder than everyone else but doesn’t compensate those that do and those that don’t get to continue with no repercussions "
Cardinal Health,Pharmacy Technician,5,Awesome place. I would reccomend and good environment to work at. Good work life balance and definitely love the food. No food is gone to waste and love the enchiladas.
Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate,3,"Good pay, benefits repetitive. Long hours but good cardio, good co workers. Sups are hands on and attentive to needs, I would recommend it, consistent work. Always some opportunity for overtime,"
Cardinal Health,Set-up Operator,5,Yes is an great place to work the pay was great although stressful would love to work here again management was OK co workers over worked sometimes easy job
Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate,4,Good environment with decent management. Fellow employees seemed happy with many having been there for over 10 years. Many opportunities to learn new equipment if one desires 
Cardinal Health,"Project Manager, Patient Recovery Post Market Surveillance",5,"Providing medical devices and products for people in need to make their lives easier, is satisfying. The company is dedicated to providing the best customer experience. "
Cardinal Health,Pharmacist,3,Not the best work environment. Toxic coworkers and lots is IT issues. If you are looking for an office/ closed setting then this is a good place for you.
Cardinal Health,Director,4,Big company with lots of opportunities to move into other areas and roles. Younger workers seem to be treated well with upward mobility and opportunities to move
Cardinal Health,Customer Service Representative,5,With activity every friday for employees to enjoy the environment of the management when working onsite. With lots of benefits for the employees. Truly an employee-first company.
Cardinal Health,Operator,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The actual job and overall company are solid. The Gan location is terribleWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Constantly changing expectations and policy changes. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic. The management is inept and over their heads. It shows as it trickles down to those actually trying to just do their jobs. What is a typical day like for you at the company?I enjoyed it unless a manager got involved in the day, then work would stop for unnecessary reasons and we would be constantly told we weren't fast enough when they were the major hold up/delay"
Cardinal Health,Sales Representative,4,Unlimited time off. Just get your work done. Great work/life balance.  Excellent culture filled with great people.Continued supply chain problems leads to losing customer trust. Not sure leadership understands the impact of the continued supply chain challenges. Difficult to close new business when customer's see we cannot deliver on existing portfolio. 
Cardinal Health,Operator,1,Bad company. No atmosphere.  Pay is pure dirt. Everyone is miserable. No incentives. Management font communicate with employees about anything. Would not recommend. 
Cardinal Health,Scientist ,1,"No support, unorganized, and high turn over. The unorganization was not suitable for any functioning team. I would not recommend anyone to work here. "
Cardinal Health,Regulatory Specialist,1,"Left previous job to work for Cardinal Health, based on the company and amazing things I heard.  From day 1, nothing went well.  Training was a joke.  I wasn't even on the team that I was hired for.  Moved around to different areas and teams 3 different times within a year.  Stayed with the same supervisor, even though that supervisor was no longer in my department.  The best thing was getting laid off for no reason other than corporate greed.  Be careful!"
Cardinal Health,Warehouse Associate,3,"Great mindless part time job. Full time is roughy but overall the team is great, and it’s on the easier end of warehouse jobs. PTO and sick time is a plus as well."
Cardinal Health,Office Manager/facilities Management,4,"Unless you work at the home office in Dublin, OH, you never felt you were part of the Big Cardinal Health. So many events and functions that no employee outside of the home office was ever part of the team. It was ""US"" & ""Them"", never ""WE"". Majority of their employees DO NOT work at the home office. It affects employee morale, and as not included."
Chevron,Cashier/Sales Associate,5,"Good team, good pay. I always felt there was something to do, and yet was never ridden by the boss. Be amazed by how many people cant use a tire guage."

Chevron,Capital Projects Manager/Projects Lead Manager,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Very political, totally corporate company!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Again it’s a political company. Doesn’t really matter what you know. It doesn’t really matter how good you are. They don’t want superstars they want people to just follow the road.!What is the work environment and culture like at the company?L Sol about pressure fear and control so I would not recommend this company for anybody!What is a typical day like for you at the company?Lots of meetings and more meetings keep everybody happy!"
Chevron,Digital Marketing Manager,5,"Super smart people, great company. Management fluctuates often so there can be stops and starts in progress due to new people coming in. The pay is great and the benefits are awesome"
Chevron,Specialist,5,"High salaryLots of perks and benefitsAnnual increase and annual bonus (depends on individual performance and company performance)Truly cares about its people (mental health, physical, emotional. there's ample of activities/events to support this every year)3 days WFHGreat management (high-calibre professionals)Great teammates too (I bet they only employ people who are really a cut above the rest)Their culture can't compare easily to other companies, it's hard to beat.Great opportunity for business acumen, if you're into energy."
Chevron,Cashier,5,"Chevron offers competitive pay and benefits, but the work environment can be demanding due to the industry’s fast pace and often remote locations.

In addition, the administration is extremely inefficient, slow and bureaucratic.Any process, however simple, becomes an odyssey due to the lack of organization and the amount of unnecessary procedures.To top it off, after they ran to my boss, they began to take away all my responsibilities with the clear objective of making me give up.This tactic of pressing employees to leave on their own is unacceptable and reflects the bad work culture that prevails in the company. They also force employees to buy the uniform, which is unusual and unusual.They never deliver payroll properly;In the app only the amount is reflected, and to obtain more details they send you an email that requires a code, which they never provide. If that were not enough, the work environment is extremely toxic.From the first day, employees begin to speak badly of other colleagues, which creates an uncomfortable and negative work environment. In summary, the lack of transparency, poor management, little ethical tactics, and the toxic work environment have madeof this place a very little satisfactory work environment"

It was challenging and hot, however,  your so busy you really do not think about it. Only negative is the laboratory manager is extremely hard to please. I felt I was doing my best to learn and to prove my hardworking ethic, however,  the lab manager was always looking for something to complain about. The bad thing is she does not confront you about it so you can get that constructive criticism to better oneself.  She just complains to the hiring agency. Make sure you do not use the restroom when she is around, better yet. Wear a diaper. They want you to hydrate yourself but do not want you to leave to take restroom breaks.

They expect your job to be your whole life and expect you to spend your days off waiting to get called in. You dont usually get paid for working overtime or covering a shift either.

Chevron,Cook/Prep,1,Be careful…. You can find something better.  The people that own this place try to keep you there by offering more money.

Chevron,Process Operator,3,"Horrible work life balance in Operations.  Management doesn't care about your growth.  You're just a number.  Miserable environment.  You can get forced to work at any moment, so good luck if you have plans.  If you are single and like lots of overtime and love to work, this is the place for you.  Great company match on the 401K (8%).  maintenance has the better schedule IMO with 4 - 10 hour day shifts monday-friday.

They think giving a treat now and  then is acceptable for all your hard work. You are there to only line there pockets with money. You are dispensable. You are a little ant inside a big hive. They do not pay you enough for the work you do.

The Home Depot,Cashier,3,"The work was easy but the high school environment makes it difficult. when I did get called in to pick up a shift because someone called off they would often forget to cover me for a break or give me my break last hour of my shift. Also would forget to send someone to your station to let you go home. You would have to call the leads to remind them your shift ended 20 mins ago and they would get annoyed because they had to now find someone to cover you. Lots of unnecessary high school drama and the more you stay away and distance yourself from it the more they talk about you. The months from August,September, October, November,December you get barely any hours about 4-10 hours a week. The work isn’t terrible the lines do get pretty long but constant work makes time go faster. "

The Home Depot,"Homewood, IL",2,Just to give a brief summary I wouldn’t recommend this position unless you really like fixing tools. Low work moral due to not enough employee support. Customers complaining left and right about a tool they broke and how they want a refund even though it’s their responsibility. In general just don’t work here.
The Home Depot,Pro Account Sales Associate,2,"The company has no values at all. The only thing they are interested in is profits. They value some random policy over an real life.

Favoritism is rampant and if your are not their favorite then your are walked over."

The Home Depot,Order Picker,3,"Enjoyed my time there, me and my former coworkers bonded over our great disdain for the management. The job only required you to grab orders and bring them to the front of the store. "
The Home Depot,Merchandise Execution Team Member,3,I got transferred to Met team due to not getting the hours I needed being a Lot Associate.  It was a mistake I made due to the bad experience I had.

The Home Depot,Floor Associate,4,"Management was not the best and it was common to be understaffed with a lot of customers in your aisle looking for help. The managers would somehow find ways to put it on you to do everything despite that, but overall its decent. If they were more understanding and scheduled more accordingly and did more thorough training the job would be a lot better."
The Home Depot,Receiver,4,I unload and sort trailers. I process orders and log them into our system. Organization is a top priority. Hardest part of the job is working solo the majority of the time.

The Home Depot,asociado de ventas,4,"A typical day at work, is the pure sale to customers, if you do not have it in physical .. is to lower it from the platform or the overhead that you think you learned, if you learn many things because you teach courses and from thereEven the promoters teach you. The address/management, because they are what they demand sales as sales programs evenMany times they are carried out. The most difficult part of work, when you send you to deliver block, cement, plaster panel in large quantities work is very heavy. What did you like the work the training you give you isVery good and you learn things that you don't even know what they are .."
The Home Depot,Department Supervisor,3,Working at Home Depot can be fun and laid back if you don’t stress about doing your best.  They overwork driven associates and allow others to do nothing.  The job itself is great but management doesn’t hold people responsible and the associates run the store.  
The Home Depot,Order Picker,1,"Pay is horrible, advancement is non-existent, complete lack of communication even though they have weekly meetings with supervisors and managers.

Not a great experience.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The new manager who didn't respect the employees who were not hired by her.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It was upbeat with the original manager.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Very busy helping customers, stocking shelves, etc."
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Certified Pharmacy Technician,2,"There are too many  lazy people here, turnover rate is high and management can only do so much. Don’t work too hard unless you want more work dumped on you. It’s much easier for them to pile work on the handful of us that do our jobs vs train or fire the ones that don’t.  They love to reward their workers with pizza parties as if we’re a bunch of grade schoolers. The levels of fake enthusiasm is nauseating, but my eyes can only roll so far back into my head. Get a head start on studying, get certified(Walgreens pays for the exam), and get out. Working in an actual store isn’t ideal but you’ll gain useful experience that can help you move on to better companies. "

Walgreens Boots Alliance,Pharmacy Operations Manager,1,"Absolutely terrible company to work for. Typical retail pharmacy culture: do more with less. Less hours and staff, but expected to do more volume. Had to reduce operation hours several times due to short-staffing. The district manager blames us. Benefits aren't that great. Costly premiums for sub-par medical loans. Unreasonable metrics that do nothing to actually help improve productivity."
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Representative,5,Great benefits great teams to work with. Always able to get assistance with issues. The main down side is the calls and dealing with upset customers. But it is easy. And Greta pay. 
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Assistant Store Manager,4,The pay is mediocre at best for floor level coworkers. Better at management level.  There's was no work life balance.  You get sucked in.  You feel a sense of obligation to the team.

Walgreens Boots Alliance,Customer Service Advisor,1,"Terrible management. No communication with staff. Complete reliant on work experience  young adults , and expect staff to train them , just get on with it attitude. Managers never in store in the morning.  Unsafe to work there. They get paid to sit in the office all day and NEVER LISTEN OR NEVER SUPPORT THEIR STAFF. VERY BAD FAVOURTISM TO STAFF.  DIFFERENT RULES FOR THEM TO THE REST OF STAFF"
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Technician,5,I enjoy interacting with all the patients and working with an amazing group of people who share a common goal. I have been working here for 3 years and still enjoy it.

Walgreens Boots Alliance,Customer Contact Representative,5,The training was easy and my team lead was very helpful. The job was a breeze to catch on to. My training instructors always checked on us to make sure we were doing ok. 
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Patient Care Advocate,3,I started with Alliance Rx and everything was very positive. As soon as the merger back to Walgreens started everything took a turn. Now there are stores that will lose and messages from the CEO that read like layoffs are coming. For the call center how well you score on all measured metrics determines your raise and there isn't really much defense if QA makes a mistake and the supervisor doesn't understand the process to know it was a mistake....so others' mistakes can affect your raise. Being stuck on calls at break times can affect your raise...things beyond your control can affect your raise. There's almost no room for advancement within the call center and each job posting is for one spot with 100's applying. If you like helping people it can be very rewarding but there are a lot of negative calls as well.
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Shift Leader,1,"When starting off you don't notice the bad things but the longer you stay and move up in the company the more you notice. I moved up in the company fairly quickly and the more I learned, the faster I knew I had to get out."

They could have done a much better job at keeping their employees. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Hectic and unorganized. One of my managers drank on the job and it created unnecessary stress. They transferred him instead of doing the right thing.

Walgreens Boots Alliance,Shift Leader,2,I started as a Beauty Advisor  11 years ago.  It took 5 years to be promoted to shift lead. I was eventually offered ESM positions but due to lack of benefits for more even more work i declined and left the company. I believe  the company is going down hill and many are being subjected to subpar treatment and work schedules. They ask too much and give too little.
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Shift Leader,3,"That is a very high stress situation to work in. There's very little organization and a lot of last minute decisions. The hardest part of the job is the high expectations and poor training. There's very little support in the training portion of working for the company, you are.

Walgreens Boots Alliance,Pharmacy Technician,2,"On a day to day basis you will see a lot of different people. It can be rewarding to help people with their health needs. The managers are ego-focused most of the time, every one is out for their own benefit. The workplace culture is not ideal all the time. The hardest part of the job is how underpaid it is. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people with their health needs. "
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Specialist,3,"I enjoyed the time I did work there. At the time they were just starting up, so everything at the moment was kind of unorganized and they also let the titles get to their head. "
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Data Analyst,5,cool job! worked here for quite some time! cool staff to work with. learned a lot here during the time i was here. i was able to progress as needed!!!
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Management Trainee,5,Working at this company is a Wonderful Experience. I have learned many valuable skills and knowledge that I can share with my teams to be successful in this Industry.
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Shift Leader,5,I had the most amazing experience working for Walgreens In North Carolina! My co workers were genuinely nice! The pay was great ! The management was beyond awesome and understanding! Unfortunately I moved to Florida to relocate and the Walgreens here in Florida is not the same and the management here will ruin your desire to proceed in your career with Walgreens! It broke me down to leave something I truly loved.
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Pharmacy Technician,1,"Unfortunately, this was a horrible place to work. The hours were never guaranteed, constantly changing schedule, and an extreme work load. I enjoyed parts of being a pharmacy tech, but the company and our work load made it miserable. "
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Customer Service Specialist II,2,I worked remotely for walgreens and rhe issues with the app and walgreens.com and also the changes to the SOP are depressing! I was not only a agent for phones and chat I was tech support mostly and the pay was not worth the depression. I lost my mom in 2023 and came back to a lower position after a month off because I was grieving. Imagine a company that demoted you on leave. Thats walgreens in a nutshell. You will be replaced and a bot in their eyes.
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Emerging Store Manager,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Some of the co workers are really niceWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?It's unorganized.  Store managers are very disrespectful and they don't appreciate their  employees. Also the payroll is cut every week.

Walgreens Boots Alliance,Remote Customer Service Representative,3,"Micromanagement and zero opportunities for advancement. Wfh and decent benefits, so it's a wash.

Snitch like and management often plays people against eachother. What is a typical day like for you at the company?A tier 4 or 5 store is busy and active, I was rarely bored.

Walgreens Boots Alliance,Staff Pharmacist,3,Not enough support to meet the demand of the job and policies related to patient care  Too many. Reduction or increase in staffing when the pharmacy does or does not reaches designated goals

Walgreens Boots Alliance,Shift Lead,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Great discounts and excellent health insurance What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Low labor budget.  Corporate should be ashamed of themselves.  We are spread do thin right now it's a wonder anything gets done.  The surveys and the sales reflect this and District management are too cowardly to stand up for us.  Store managers are not set up for success and the rest of us are barely scraping by due to the cuts. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Not happy.  Exhausted and on edgeWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?You play catch up from the moment you arrive
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Pharmacy Technician in Training,1,"The company had staffing issues on the whole and was alway cutting corners which in turn made it difficult to deliver excellent customer service.  The location in which I served clients was an impoverished neighborhood. I saw a huge difference in the store appearance of Walgreen's in wealthier neighborhoods. Our location had sewage issues in the basement making the employee bathrooms unuseable very often with raw sewage all over the floor right next to our staff breakroom. It was overall a very toxic work environment. Employees had to choose which holiday they wanted to be off: Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's.....you could only get one out of the three. We were not notified of our weekly schedule sometimes until 2 days before the beginning of the new week making it impossible to make personal plans. "
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Finance Business Partner,4,"Good company overall, but moving to 5 day in the office model. Hence many moving on. Support and leadership is good. Great staff shop. Friendly staff in finance.  "
Walgreens Boots Alliance,"Senior Manager, Marketing",2,"Upper Management changes every few months and with it so do the priorities.  It's hard to get anything done, the technology is so bad.  We were still working in green screens!  If you want to be a number and a puppet to upper management then this is the place for you."
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Call Center Representative,5,Great place to work. You are treated like a member of the family.  Leadership really appreciates you as a person and respects your time when it comes to taking time off. 
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Pharmacy Graduate Intern,1,"When I had sent my resignation letter after my good work and service for them for 2 years, I did not receive a warm goodbye from anyone. No one gave any consideration or even cared. I technically wasted my years working for Walgreens. I do not plan to apply again. Thank you."
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Assistant Store Manager,4,The pay is mediocre at best for floor level coworkers. Better at management level.  There's was no work life balance.  You get sucked in.  You feel a sense of obligation to the team.
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Technician,3,Management didn't always care. Higher ups didn't think about customers. Only about the bottom line. Stressful. Want you to do 3 people's jobs and expect same results. Not thinking that the customers are what brings them money. Only care about the jab. 
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Pharmacist,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Team work effort .No job dealing with community health can be totally effective by one person.It takes a dedicated team.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with medication costs and drug shortages.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful at times and good at times like any activity dealing with public.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Very very busy.Always something to get caught up on.
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Pharmacy Advisor,3,"The best part of the job are the patients and colleagues. It can be a truly rewarding job to provide for patients who are in need, and I've made lifelong friendships with some colleagues. There is always something to do, never a moment of boredom, which makes the day go quickly and makes you feel very productive.One of the worst parts of the job is also the patients. Working in customer service will always lead to unpleasant encounters with the general public, however the rudeness and verbal abuse is another level when working in a pharmacy. The patients really can make or break your day.Additionally, the management is not good. The focus from the higher powers is all about meeting targets and not about patient care and keeping up to date with the ever growing workload. When there is staff sickness or annual leave, getting cover is rare which only leads to getting behind on the workload and therefore angry patients. When it comes to booking your own annual leave, some managers are excellent but some prioritize their own over their staff and won't let you know if you can have your leave until a month or so in advance, which makes booking holidays incredibly difficult. The environment of the workplace is incredibly toxic. Favouritism is incredibly blatant among store managers as well as those above. Being a female-dominated environment, there are immense levels of gossip and petty drama which just feels like high school all over again.In terms of accessibility, I have found less than the bare minimum of accommodations for being autistic. For example, staffing plans are - more..."
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Shift Leader/Inventory Specialist,3,"The thing that stands out most about this company is how many bad decisions have been made in the past several years. From bad acquisitions to worse CEOs, failed ventures to massive amounts of waste. These decisions have put them in a position where they are cutting hours, staff and pay but still continuing to add new services, programs and metrics to the workload. Like many retailers, their staff is overworked, underpaid and woefully understaffed but still expected to perform at the same level as when they had enough hours and staff. A typical day for most people is trying to cram 16 hours of work into 8 hours while being pulled in a dozen different directions. Training is seriously lacking in most areas, management is overworked and underpaid, and you have a lot of staff doing nothing because they know they can get away with it. It's very much a 10/90 kind of environment. 10% of the employees doing 90% of the work, with long term employees making the same or even less than new hires. "
Walgreens Boots Alliance,CSR - Customer Service Representative,1,If you don’t become best friends with management they will totally mess you over. They only favor employees who hang out with them off the clock and being in the pharmacy guarantees you’ll be treated like a king. Very toxic workplace. 
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Shift Leader,1,"Work Environment And Less Pay And More Responsibilities. Work Stress Towards The Job And Compare To Pay Its Too Much To Work And Be Focused And Work Environment Atmosphere Was Very Bad In Allston, MA."
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Pharmacy Technician,4,"Doesn't matter if u a the best worker ull get paid the least compare to someone who is in the company longer and there's no way to increase ur pay other way , just time. Really discouraging, so do not work hard, do not try hard, do ur bare minimum,  ull still get paid the same"
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Pharmacist in Charge,2,Don't pay enough to deal with ignorant patients and district managers. I won't work here for less than $85/hr and that's even a stretch. Move on to better pharmacies with less stressful environments. 
Walgreens Boots Alliance,CSA - Customer Service Associate,5,"Good place to start career If you want to end living and die young this is the place for you!Everyone has two faces, corporate American pockets in management just want to be filled at your expense.  Don't be fooled"
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Shift Leader,2,Working at Walgreens has been really helpful for being a full time student. It has a flexible schedule that you can balance with school life and I’ve met awesome people.
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Pharmacy Advisor,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?It used to be the staff, good team workWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?When someone leaves , they are not always replaced. The staff  have become pawns to be moved about to cover the shortage of staff.  Also lack of leadership and double standardsWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?It was once a happy friendly place but now it's toxic.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I normally multitasking three jobs at once."
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Shift Leader,2,"I quit yesterday and have a sense of relief now. There was a huge lack of communication between shifts. A lot of unfinished projects none knew what to do with. We rarely had team meetings, like four out of a year. I wasn't given much opportunity  when I asked for it or training. A normal work day wasn't bad as I enjoyed my work and coworkers. However there was cliques and it was getting toxic for my mental health. No team building exercises were ever done while I worked there I think that would have improved communication and a sense of belonging. "
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Inventory Specialist,5,I walk the store doing my everyday jobs which include. pharmacy work to scan in the workload of medications to fill for prescriptions to doing smart counts on certain medications every day to make sure counts are correct.  cashing out customers that are picking up their prescriptions. correcting inventory on merchandise on the front end.customer service. helping customers find what they need and checking to make sure they find everything they are looking for.scan-outs are done in the store every week to make sure we get products in on our warehouse truck.

Walgreens Boots Alliance,"Nottingham, Nottinghamshire",4,Great perks if you're into beauty and healthcare.Not enough structure to depts though it seems no one is clear on who does what. Spend more time chasing info than doing anything with it
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Customer Service Associate,4,"A typical day involves the daily duties such as bringing items from the warehouse to the store floor, cashiering, merchandising, and keeping the story tidy. I believe this job helped me learn better time management, resource manangement, and how to more effentially communicate as a team. The management has been very iffy, where some days they may love you and reward you for your extra effort while other days you will be ridiculed for doing task exactly how you were explained to do them. The manager has full authority over the store and exercises it poorly. The culture here was not a very good one, our shift leads encouraged us to skip steps to finish task quicker, issues are overlooked for as long as they can be, and alot of the fault or blame is quickly thrown on one person so the other employees look better. The hardest part of the job has just been the mental loops that retail can throw you through, dealing with short staff and trying to sastify customer demands at the same time, trying to make sure your other coworkers are doing what they are supposed to be doing so you can work on your task (even when your not a manager, becuase if you don't the task list will pile up and eventually fall on you), and balancing a good dynamic with other coworkers who may not share the same skills or work ethic. The most enjoyable part of the job is definietly the simplicty of it. The days where most of the task for the week have been completed, or you just got done with a big project the day before, the daily duties are all you are responsible for. As long as the store is clean and presentable - more..."

Walgreens Boots Alliance,Area Training Manager,4,"Great people to work with,earned so much in my role. Saw lots of changes and challenges during my time with the company. Loved management support and vendors support "
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Lead Shift Supervisor,4,Wasn’t paid enough for being bilingual and our schedules weren’t getting rotated like all the other stores in the area. Management wouldn’t give me days because of seniority and favoritism. 
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Pharmacy Technician,2,"The current compensation structure fails to adequately reflect the demanding workload expected daily. Yearly pay increases amount to mere cents, leaving employees feeling undervalued regardless of their dedication and effort. Insufficient staffing levels exacerbate the workload, resulting in constant stress, exhaustion, and feelings of overwhelm. Dealing with challenging customers and managing situations involving drug-related issues further deplete energy reserves. Since the merger with Alliance Boots, the company's operational conditions have deteriorated, compounding the challenges faced by employees."
Walgreens Boots Alliance,Certified Pharmacy Technician (CPhT),3,"Face -paced pharmacy setting, loyal customers base with excellent communication to promote longevity in the community healthcare. Excellent staff! The Breaux Bridge location is a disaster not team- oriented only more workload for certain members! While others are promoted for your work! "

I began as a Customer Advisor and worked my way up to Healthcare Advisor and was being put through the Dispenser program, I cannot fault Boots development within their employees, they are spectacular in that area.The hours are average enough, pay could be better but is still good. Staff, in general are quite nice.However, if you have any issues within the workplace and need support from management, Boots is not the place to be. I was completely overlooked and not cared for as my position was more dispensable than the position of the person of conflict. You will be highly valued in there, until you cause hassle!"

Marathon Petroleum,Project Controls Specialist,3,Good pay and benefits but micromanagers.  The refinery has a lot of nepotistic qualities with limited flexibility.  The refinery specifically lacks diversity and inclusion and management claims they want you to have a work life balance but only cares about work and cutting costs.  
Marathon Petroleum,Cashier/Customer Service,1,"Management is B.S. No one cares about others health concerns in the higher ups. Even with diabetes, working alone isn't and shouldn't be a thing. Multiple times where I've had to have a customer watch for me while I attended to my health. "

The benefits and pay were top-notch, showing they valued everyone's contributions. What stood out even more was their commitment to helping us grow professionally.

MY immediate supervisors would listen to my concerns and work with me to help me accomplish my professional goals. "
Marathon Petroleum,Fuel Truck Driver,1,A typical day is 12 hours mandatory almost because your managers bonus is derived from truck utilization workplace culture is bad they don’t pay overtime and require you more often than not to work 12 hours most enjoyable part of the company is the 747 match 401(k)
Marathon Petroleum,Refining Engineer,4,"I’ve worked at Marathon for 5 years. My experience has been heavily weighted by my direct supervisor. Luckily, I’ve had great direct supervisors most of the time and really enjoyed work! The work is challenging, keeps you busy, and there is a lot of room for movement. Marathon also pays very well and has great benefits.I feel like Marathon upper leadership does not genuinely care about their people with its “low cost culture”. I wish Marathon could be more flexible with hours and part time work options for moms."

Marathon Petroleum,Transport Driver,5,"Report to terminal, pick up workload for the day, go to truck pre-trip, and begin your day.Usually hauling gas, diesel, ethanol, or jet fuel. This is the best company I have ever worked for, honestly, you get the message that it’s more about safety than the bottom line of making a profit. But sadly, there’s a lot of turnover because of the strict no phone policy. "
Marathon Petroleum,Pipeline,4,"Join our dynamic team!! Enjoy a fulfilling job with competitive pay, comprehensive benefits, and opportunities for growth. Your success, our priority."

Marathon Petroleum,Fry Cook/Prep Cook/Dishwasher,2,"A typical day at work consists of trying to balance being a good worker with not allowing management to put you in a position to be a meat shield to keep themself from being fired.I've learned that it's best to find a new job the second you realize management will overwork you.Management is sad to be nice. Management only cares about saving face and not the company. Even to the point of trying to sell food that needs to be replaced.Workplace culture isn't that good. Some team members spend more time socializing than working which results in unfinished work, food sometimes being left in the smoker and oven or on the stove which has burned. This also results in a few workers keeping the store from facing health code violations such as containers not being washed properly and building up bacteria.The hardest part of the job is facing harassment from management should you decide to ignore them and fix issues that they've caused.Most team member are nice and customers will sometimes compliment your good work."

Marathon Petroleum,Operator ,3,Marathon is a decent place to work. Management is alittle painful but it’s decent after that. Work schedule is a DuPont (in refinery operations)  so it’s not for the faint of heart. 
Marathon Petroleum,Operations,1,"Horrible management, keep your head down, dont ask questions, no suggestions, dont bring up concerns or you will face retaliation. Communication on all levels is non existent.  Hr is useless and could care less about issues with basic employee benefits and issues within the work place.  "

Marathon Petroleum,Operator,2,"Operators and Management like ""crabs in a bucket""! Great pay but no home life. I do not recommend this place to my worst enemy! Look somewhere else..."
Marathon Petroleum,Financial Analyst,2,"Has become a very political place to work. The culture has changed quite significantly over the years. Used to be a place where you wanted to work, but there are so many younger people who work there that don't actually want to work or have responsibilities that are part of their job, but want to get paid more and more."
Marathon Petroleum,Store Manager,3,They are not the Greatest to work for. Franchise stores have no morals. They don't follow Marathon standards and do not redirect their employees the least bit

Marathon Petroleum,Process Operator,3,Was a great place but the union makes you feel like a contractor. Creates a divide between employees. Also it sucks to get put on strike for things you don't agree with...
Marathon Petroleum,2nd Mate,4,I love working here personally but there are allot of draw backs you have to overlook. If you’re coming here and not already a wheelman looking to get to the wheel house don’t just don’t. Marathon is an easy place to work and you can make decent money with other growth opportunities but getting there is SLOW. Like be prepared to retire here. It may take you 10 years to get to the wheel house at no fault of your own there just not the openings to do so. I love working here and I’ll probably retire here. I recommend coming here for sure even though the quality of people we are getting since they got rid of the rest has been horrible. 
Marathon Petroleum,Light product driver ,3,It’s the easiet job I’ve ever had. Pay is terrible benefits are good. Only way to make money is by working your 5th day. Too many drivers not enough work 
Marathon Petroleum,Dispatcher II,1,"It’s an incredibly cliquish culture from employees to management. Don’t bother letting them know you are struggling because it will be used against you in the future. If you have children or a family, I highly recommend reconsidering applying for anything logistical or pipeline oriented. Even when using your PTO, you will be ostracized for it and they will see you as a weak link. After many years of working for this company, I can honestly say they do not care about their employees or how management treats them. Don’t bother contacting Human Resources for any issues because not only will it be used against you but it will become a known issue amongst your department even if it was reported privately or anonymously. "
Marathon Petroleum,Operator,5,"This is a pretty good place to work.  Pay is good.   Could be more.    Maintenance seems to run operations, which isn’t how it should be.    But what can you do about that. "

Marathon Petroleum,Customer Service Specialist,1,It was a contract position in which we were led to believe could turn into a permanent position. This was not in fact the case.  My immediate supervisor and direct manager were less than respectful.  The schedule changed frequently and other staff were always late or calling out.  Meetings were mandatory even on your day off. During meetings staff was encouraged to offer feedback or ask questions and then belittled when they did. 
Marathon Petroleum,Scheduler,5,"Great people, great pay. Stressful sometimes and work rotating shift. Days and nights. Nice amenities. Lots of phone calls during day shift. Good management. They recognize hard work. "

Marathon Petroleum,Cdl A Fuel Transport Driver,3,"Little to no supervision on site. Rarely at Niles location. A big problem when you need an issue addressed. A lot of check the box, wink-wink. BUT you will be constantly hammered with ridiculously easy to set off cameras in trucks, on a regular basis. Incidents push your raise to top by by 3 months. So new drivers are financially penalized, while veterans are not. Training is hit or miss. A lot of misses & then when you are on your own & have any type of incident, blamed on you. Harrassment is mostly ignored & not addressed. If you push these issues upward, they will get rid of you. If you like a toxic, negative environment you've found the right place. Pay & benefits are great, if you can stand the constant negativity. I could not. Most could not. Revolving employee door & why they are constantly hiring. "

They like to keep moving the targets up, so only achievable by working all available days."
Marathon Petroleum,Advanced Processor,4,Work in Controllers Group.  Customer service and Accounting background is needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the group of people that I worked with.
Marathon Petroleum,Truck Driver,1,There is a snitch culture here that makes it hard to form any friendships here. The employees are a bunch of back standers that look at your demise as a way to advance. The work life balance is impossible. If you are a single parent don’t work there if you want to parent. The management there is very anti-employee. They only care about looking good. Don’t know the guy who is the RTM now. But the person in charge from 2019 to 2022 hated drivers. 
Marathon Petroleum,Cashier/Sales Associate,4,"The overall job is pretty basic as things go. General stocking, cashier duties, and customer service. The pay is good for the work being asked, and the schedule was very flexible and easy to adjust. "

Marathon Petroleum,Operator,4,"Frontline management is a joke , once you accept they are constantly lying to you it’s not that bad. Great pay & benefits.   Great Fellow coworkers……."
Marathon Petroleum,Transport Driver,4,"It’s very “corporate “ for a driving job. During your training phase you will go to headquarters in Findlay for a week long orientation/indoctrination where they will observe how you interact with other people. I’m not really a people person, which is one reason why I have chosen a career as a driver. Marathon was a very uncomfortable place to be, for me. The pay is decent, other benefits good, but lots of long meetings and a generally social atmosphere that didn’t suit me. If you like your solitude, this isn’t the place."
Marathon Petroleum,Cashier,3,You have a handfull of tasks to finish by the time you leave and as long as it all gets finished in time everyone is happy. You still have to assist customers but that is it.

Marathon Petroleum,Process Specialist V,1,"As an operator for marathon you will make really good money. However, you will rotate day and night shift with lots of forced OT and unpaid on call.  You will live a life constantly jet lagged. Management does not care about employees. There’s extreme tension between union and management. You’ll be around a lot of toxic materials and fumes. Most operators have serious health problems after retirement. 24/7 365 operation "
Marathon Petroleum,Janitor,5,It was super laid back able to communicate well and not hostile at all. Everyone was nice and the bosses were understanding good people who care about there workers.

Marathon Petroleum,Accounts Payable Clerk,5,Its a great place to work alot of room to grow and the staff is so friendly even the line managers. I am still at training and things have been way better than i ever imagined.
Marathon Petroleum,Cashier,2,Doesn't care about employees. Stressful work place. Everything is too expensive. People steal from there every day. I was spit at and threatened by customers.
Marathon Petroleum,Lead Engineer,4,Marathon knows its core business well and has established work processes.  Technical environment with strong teaming culture.  Its a publically traded company so job security is not guaranteed if the industry or market turns.   
Marathon Petroleum,Business Analyst,4,"Marathon is a great company to work for. Well compensated (base and bonuses), reasonable focus on extended education, and good growth opportunities internally. Changing now with more regional corporate offices, but Findlay, Ohio isn't quite the ideal place unless you want family and kids. Overall, pretty decent place to work. I hope they diversify into real alternative energy options in the next 5-15 years, but won't hold my breath. "
Elevance Health,"Indianapolis, IN",5,There are many opportunities for growth.  This is a very diverse company that values both the employee and customers.  There are many areas to explore career wise.
Elevance Health,"MEMBER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE,",1,Your manager will not be able to help you with anything. Pay is beyond under the poverty line / in a member service role you will speak with people with all kinds of ailments even some terminally ill and if you have a heart this role will become harder the more you do it! With that being said the pay your receive is not appropriate for that level of absorption of pain.
Elevance Health,Utilization Review Nurse,1,Should have quit sooner.  Work load was impossible and you have to teach yourself how to do it.   Some teammates were amazing most were not.    Did not enjoy working with the mean girls club.  
Elevance Health,RN Case Manager,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Working from home, flexible hours and holidays off What is the most stressful part about working at the company?A revolving door of management that didn't have a clue how to manage."
Elevance Health,Customer Service Representative,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The staff was amazing and informative and a great place to work for. love themWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?never had  a problem with anything at the company. wanted to do a great job to be a team player What is the work environment and culture like at the company?very good place to work for and staff help in anyway they could.What is a typical day like for you at the company?smooth, and very excited for the day ahead."
Elevance Health,Senior IT Specialist,1,"If you are looking for a family to be loyal to, look elsewhere.If you are looking to advance, make money, and retire, look elsewhere.If you are looking for fairness, look elsewhere.If you like being micromanaged to death, this is the place for you!If you like being lied to and taken advantage of by management, this is the place for you!"
Elevance Health,Telesales Representative,3,"Pay rate is ok but they changed constantly the shifts, if the department is low, they changed you to other department. I have being here for a year and had 5 different shifts and 3 different positions because they hired to many people and then figured it out that they dont need that much people."
Elevance Health,Nurse appeals,5,The workload is ok but the salary is not competitive. You are just a number in the company. Benefits are good and competitive though. It’s the base pay that is not competitive. 
Elevance Health,Program Director,2,"In my many years in healthcare, i have never seen such high turnover. It appears that people are laid off every other month and many staff, including recruiters, talk about feeing insecure about their jobs. Teamwork is good if you don't mind all the 30-somethings making comments about being old after 40. Management and leadership is poor, with little structure or training for leadership development. In fact, training and development for all employees is poor, beginning with orientation. New hires will have to take responsibility for their own orientation. Their off-boarding process is stellar."
Elevance Health,Claims Processor,2,Company changed over the years. Management used to know your name and who you were. Then you basically became a number and expected to work like robots. They are automating as much as possible and sending the rest over seas. Very little is being done in the states anymore.  
Elevance Health,Customer Service Representative/Fax Team ,1,The company taught me they way to talk to customers but there’s no room for growth the attendance point system sucks they show favoritism someone had more points than me and they were still working there I don’t like this company the points system is horrible they don’t retrain you if you need help they don’t ask you do you need help they show favoritism they threw me in a different department without my approval I didn’t even know how to do faxes and training you need to be in more than you need to do training for like six months I do not recommend this company
Elevance Health,Pharmacy Technician,1,"This place has no idea what they’re doing. They want people to be robots and meet ridiculous metrics and have quality work. You can’t have both. I know people are stressed, even I became stressed trying to meet unreasonable numbers and I’m usually a calm person. I would not recommend working here unless you are ok with being put under unrealistic pressure."
Elevance Health,Customer Service Representative,3,alot of freedom but they expect alot from one person. The lack of immediate assistance can be annoying sometimes but overall its a good place i'd say myself 
Elevance Health,Utilization Review Nurse,4,What is the best part of working at the company?I loved the company so much but unfortunately after my 3rd year of working there I noticed that they became more about business than the patients. They let go of over 100 staff and moved a lot of departments out of the US to save themselves money. It was sad to see so many people lose their jobs and they refused to let me stay in my position since I moved out of state even though it was a remote position. Other than that I had a great team and I loved my managers but the company itself seems greedy. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Nothing stressful besides wondering if I was going to be next on the chopping blockWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Everyone was very nice to me and was very helpful on the team I was on. What is a typical day like for you at the company?I had a nice day everyday. I had a steady workflow and was able to get help if I was in over my head.
Elevance Health,Administrative Assistant,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Its a paycheck. Some of the people i work with. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lay offs underlying feeling of doom. Offshoring. Inequitable raise/bonus structure. The rich get richer the rest not so much. Some get unlimited pto some do not. Forced into office . do more with less. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Shaky. They put up a front of caring but the bottom line is all that matters. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Long and stressful. When go into office unpeoductive
Elevance Health,Insurance Specialist,1,"They hire within more than new outside people. They hire with no experience. The HR is not on your side it's on the managers side. Learning insurance can be difficult and managers usually have no knowledge of it.  Managers get away with cursing and being mean however you still are expected to sit there, listen and do your job. Worked here many years, and treated as disposable "
Elevance Health,Behavioral Health and EAP Consultant I,5,"I worked here for three years. I absolutely loved my work, the people that I worked with, and the culture. The company takes great care of its employees and for me the benefits were excellent. I met some wonderful people working here that I am still friends with. I looked forward to going to work every day and the life balance here in terms of taking care of your mental health was excellent."
Elevance Health,Customer Care Representative,5,"I am disappointed that after all my hard work and efforts that right before 2 year anniversary I’m being let go due to being in car accident this year and circumstances beyond my control . I am very disheartened to have been let go a month before 2 years with Elevance Health due to not residing within 50 miles of Pulse Point. I enjoyed working with my team and manager however, I feel like I worked hard all for me to get let go. I hope in near future the remote policy can be revamped to help rather than harm the employees. Honestly, my role as CCR can be done remotely and hybrid. I feel there should have been an exception due to the nature of the circumstances with me being outside of 50 miles from PP. "
Elevance Health,Investigator Assistant,5,I have been at Elevance Health (Anthem) for two years and the opportunity for career development and growth is bigger than any other major company I have worked for.
Elevance Health,Member Service Representative,5,Okay it was okay the job wasn’t bad at all supportive management and coworkers people there always willing to help you great pto as well and they treat you faid
Elevance Health,Prior Authorization Specialist,2,The company is currently under going major layoffs and reductions in workforce across the board even Doctors included. Not sure of what is going on within the company.
Elevance Health,"Indianapolis, IN",5,There are many opportunities for growth.  This is a very diverse company that values both the employee and customers.  There are many areas to explore career wise.
Elevance Health,Referral Specialist II,4,"I've been with the company for over 2 years and promoted a little after a year. The company as a whole is great. I just want to move forward in a different line of business at the company. It is difficult trying to get off phones to do something else. I feel like once you are on phones, they don't want you doing anything else. Pto is accrued and no sick days. Bid for days off. I like the company, just want to be challenged more without phones. I don't think metrics are difficult."
Elevance Health,Systems Analyst Executive Advisor ,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Great place to work.  Expect turbulence as insurance markets are changing What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Fear of reduction in force  /  layoffs What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Friendly professional coworkers What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work on exciting projects that matter to overall business success
Elevance Health,Pharmacy Customer Associate,1,"This company doesn't value it's employees. I started this job with the intention to do something that mattered; you'd think the company would appreciate that, NOPE. If you don't follow the robotic guidelines they give, you're instantly a target. If you go out of your way to help patients, you're not rewarded or recognized, instead you're penalized because you missed one part of their script.This company wants to present a front that they're efficient and care, but that's far from the truth. Their solution = let's dehumanize our associates. You better be prepared to never go to the bathroom off scheduled breaks or get sick. You will not only be questioned extensively but written up. Most jobs allow you to take the day unpaid when sick; not here. If you don't have PTO, forget missing work EVER. You can, but it'll get marked against you therefore advancing or moving positions is withheld from you for several months. By the time this job is through with you, you'll be a pit of anxiety and depression. This place is beyond broken. "
Elevance Health,Claims processing,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Low pay. If you’re  white little to no opportunities. Raises are a joke. No support from management or HR. ITS A REVOLVING  DOORWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?No opportunities. Ridiculous management decisionsWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?White has no opportunities. Mgmnt favoritism   Zero tolerance inflicted on white caucasions only. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Production driven intense scrutiny for some
Elevance Health,Referral Specialist I,3,Productive place to work for. Very Busy.  I like to work for this job. Good Benefits. Work from home. Supply computer and all material needed to do your job.
Elevance Health,Grievance and Appeals Coordinator,1,"Elevance doesn't care of its employees, only the numbers of revenue as a big box company would. The pay is very low for the work load they put onto their employees and expect to have done. The management seems to lack of training and don't really know what they're doing. Lastly, job security. There is none. It seems that the companys objective is that they want all there workers to work in Georgia as its based there. All on all, I wouldn't waste the time on applying here. Take your worth someone else. "
Elevance Health,"Director, Provider Network Management",2,"I have never seen a company so paralyzed by making a decision and seeing it through. We would be a directive, and after months of working toward that plan, it would be dropped, and we'd be forced to change plans yet held to the targets of the previous plan."
Elevance Health,Medical Claims Processor,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The management and benefits are great!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Some of the claims can be a lot work.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Amazing! Everyone is friendly and willing to help What is a typical day like for you at the company?Come in complete the claims assigned.
Elevance Health,Assistant Manager,3,"Working with smart, passionate team is best part of the job!  It can be a stressful environment at times but having a good team in the trenches with you is invaluable. "
Elevance Health,Clinical Quality Program Manager,4,Good company to work for.  Would not be interested in a leadership (director) position though.  Work Life for that level would not be worth it to me. 
Elevance Health,Clinical Review Nurse Senior,5,I love working here! The management I'm under is wonderful. We have independence but the assignments are fullfilling and you feel like you're making a difference for the facilities you work with and Medicare. 
Elevance Health,"Provider Reimbursement Administrator, Senior",3,"This company will routinely lay off and/or fire employees right around August through November and then freeze all hiring through January. This is to appease the stock holders. Then, in February, magically they have the funds againt to hire more people, but not quite enough people to get the job done. Elevance Health is mediocre at what they do at best. They're a Jacl of All Trades, Master of NONE. If you like working short staffed, and getting company adorned socks in the mail as appreciation gifts. this is your place. If you want to feel like you actually matter, don't apply here."
Elevance Health,Client Service Specialist,5,It's a great place to work and managers communicate and provide great feedback. Work can be overwhelming at times but overall a great place to work if you put in the work
Elevance Health,CSR - Customer Service Representative ,2,The management teams at Elevance are not that great with consistent and clear communication. Trainings can be confusing because you are given conflicting information. Trying to get help as a new employee is not very supportive. 
Elevance Health,Learning Program Manager,5,"This is a great place to work! The culture is one of welcoming diverse ideas and opinions. There were always opportunities available to me to explore and seize on my own, and others given to me on numerous occasions. I started in the office, moved to hybrid, then full-time at home, and then back to hybrid. The entire company is now some form of hybrid (i.e., X days per week in an office). "
Elevance Health,Medical Management Nurse,3,Just a place to work that allows you the opportunity to work from home.  They do not pay very well even with a load of experience in acute care nursing. 
Elevance Health,Dispute Analyst,4,The health insurance is cheap compared to other health insurance. They’ve recently added other benefits like daycare reimbursement and a grocery reimbursement 
Elevance Health,Case Manager,3,Great way to gain experience and work hands on with members to address care needs. Pays fairly well. But they have random layoffs to protect bottom line 
Elevance Health,Account Manager,3,"Great team!  However,  Elevance  is a large company with a lot of departments and red tape. Sometimes hard to get answers timely as others do not have sense of urgency to provide support needed and expected. "
Elevance Health,Senior Project Manager,2,"Over the years, the workplace has become adjustable to sad to plain terrible. Frequent layoffs make you think you are in some sort of reality tv show where any day you could be the one to face the axe. "
Elevance Health,"Indianapolis, IN",5,There are many opportunities for growth.  This is a very diverse company that values both the employee and customers.  There are many areas to explore career wise.
Elevance Health,Care Manager,4,Good place to workVery flexible schedule with work from home but depends on what team you end up working on. Lots of ongoing state regulations and changes to adjust to. Lots of admin work but very nice work culture
Elevance Health,Customer Service Representative,5,Excellent support by management. Co-workers willing to bend over backwards to help. Decent pay with many opportunities for advancement. Sometimes the people you deal with (clients and providers) are annoying but it's the behavioral health field.
Elevance Health,Customer Service Representative,3,Can be a great supportive team like atmosphere or you can feel like your manager is breathing down your neck all day even with the job being remote. Depends on your department. 
Elevance Health,Network Management Rep II,2,"The most toxic workplace I have ever been a part of,   there is heavy favoritism by management and heavy heavy micro management and disregard for employee wellbeing. "
Elevance Health,Analyst,3,Been here for almost two decades and the raises are not much. Work from home. But pay is not enough for bills. Typical a lot of overtime.it’s a lot of work. 
Elevance Health,Senior Digital Product Manager,3,"Working in Digital, leadership have worked for the organization 20 plus years. Their lack of exposure to other cultures and ways of working inhibit newcomers from making real change and influence. Employees work under the constant stress of layoffs, while the CEO pulls down a compensation package of 23 Million. "
Elevance Health,LTSS Service Coordinator,3,Staffing shortage right now causing some shifts in caseloads. Hoping for brighter days. Really like 4 10-hr shifts after 6 months hired. Upper management lacking. 
Elevance Health,Program Administrator,2,"When I started, the company was great. Top level leadership came in and they have regular layoffs.  With the layoffs comes increased work loads for those remaining with zero recognition for the efforts."
Elevance Health,Referral Specialist,5,"Incentives are excellent, pay is good w/ quarterly bonus and pay raises, great opportunities for advancement, Internal promotion or hiring takes precedence. Great coworkers and management. Benefits offered are great. "
Elevance Health,Unknown,2,They will have you doing multiple jobs all at once with the continuous layoffs they continue to have.  When they lay you off they say they will help you but they don't. I have applied over 100+ jobs and nothing. You are just a number to them. You ask supervisor for feedback but they never provide it to you. This used to be a great company to work for but no longer. If you are interested in working for them be careful. They expect you to do more with less which will lead to extreme burnout. 
Elevance Health,Case Management/LTSS Service Coordinator/assessor,3,Management was not always available. Clicks that lead to poor operations. People were promoted to roles that they were not qualified for. Most enjoyable part of the job was assisting member to maneuver the healthcare benefits and advocate for their needs. hardest part of the job was being asked to decline members who needed the benefits of their plan .
Elevance Health,Business Information Analyst,2,"The company is going downhill. Worked here for a decade. They have had 2 big layoffs within a year. They also made the positions hybrid instead of remote. If you want fully remote, they are moving away from that model."
Elevance Health,Remote,3,I was with this company for 13+ years. Layed off with no placement support. The redeployment program was useless. Management was always pretty good though.
Elevance Health,Triage Consultant,5,"I have worked with elegance for 3 years and it is a good place to work they really look out for their employees. Some work may be hard, but the supervisors are more than willing to help. "
Elevance Health,Lead Business Analyst,3,"Typical day is busy. Manager is new so does not offer support well. I’ve learned the culture is awful , they provided free snacks as an incentive which they are now taking back; they force you to go into the office to make up time missed for jury duty, PTO or being sick. High turnover in my role and after two years I’m starting to see why. Most people don’t know their policies or guidelines. Lots of customer dissatisfaction. "
Elevance Health,Nurse Case Manager,3,Remote work is attractive. Some micro managing and new policies that are driving production over patient centered care. Overall not bad for the pay and “work-life” balance
Elevance Health,LTSS Service Coordinator,5,Great team and atmosphere. Training opportunities. Good management. Pto and benefits are great.  Work from home with some travel.  Good communication. My boss supports and helps me with all I need. 
Elevance Health,"St. Louis, MO",3,This has been a very stable job for almost 15 years but all of a sudden feels very chaotic and nerve wracking as many managers are being laid off.  Wish we could go back to feeling stable. 
Elevance Health,LTTS Service Coordinator,1,Indiana pathways for aging program. Provided 2 weeks notice. I was not paid out my PTO time because it is not a required law in the state I  live (Indiana) . This is time I earned and part of my compensation. Underpaid according to the mrp they provided. I was initially told I could advance to management only to find out after employed that was not true. The pathways for aging program has a waiting list for new home based services hence the whole point of the program. 
Elevance Health,RN Case Manager,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?The salary and benefits (I.e., 401K with matching contributions, medical, dental, life insurance, etc.). What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Very sick patients and extremely high caseloads. Metrics that must be met every month. Keeping up with multiple licensures and many other assignments and projects without enough time in the work day to keep up with them. Having to do your colleagues’ work in addition to your own. The turnover and burnout rate is high. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful and demanding most of the time. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Calling your highest priority clients and their doctor’s offices first. After calling your highest priority clients you can work on your backlog and other projects. Attending meetings. Making sure you’re up to date with all of your training and CEUs. Checking your emails multiple times throughout the day. Checking in with your colleagues to see if they need assistance."
Elevance Health,"Indianapolis, IN",5,There are many opportunities for growth.  This is a very diverse company that values both the employee and customers.  There are many areas to explore career wise.
Elevance Health,Unknown,2,"Goals were set years ago and have been mostly missed since,   They just hire a new leader until they miss and get fired that is not accountability,  Leaders feel they can continue to lean on legacy Anthem brand everything but that is not enough and the ancillary service offerings and capabilities are far behind competitors."
Elevance Health,Pharmacy Customer Associate - BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy,2,"they constantly lay people off, they know they have bare minimum calls but still try to hire knowing they are going to lay workers off due to “reduction in force”"
Elevance Health,EAP Consultant,5,"Best place to work!!! Productive work, constant calls but worth it. Fun place to work, supervisors and coworkers are helpful and make it fun to work. Even while remote everyone makes it fun to be apart of the team. "
Elevance Health,Legal specialist / Paralegal ,3,"Being laid off with no warning was alarming and so disheartening, ingenuous and insulting. This situation will not be easy for many as we regroup and find new jobs. "
Elevance Health,Medicare Sales Representative,4,"Got laid off due to budget cuts, however I would work there again! I was lucky to have a great manager and team. We all got along and worked together well. "
Elevance Health,Financial Operations Specialist,4,I’ve worked for this company 10 years and it has been a real learning and growth experience for me.  Since working remotely the work-life balance has really been a blessing for me.
Elevance Health,Facilitated Enroller,4,"Poor management, horrible communication, no transparency, becoming very number oriented, has lost its family value atmosphere. This was a great organization to work for but their rapid desire to grow is hindering the potential. "
Elevance Health,CSR - Customer Service Representative,3,Work from home is great but may change soon. Currently requires in office visits one time per month.  Few options to upskill while working.  Raises are dependent on performance but even when you exceed them they delay the promotion for miniscule things when even all metrics over exceed on annual review of one month is above goal but not as consistent as other months you will not get raise.  
Elevance Health,Utilization Management Representative III,3,Has great pay and benefits. Co-workers were supportive. Management was not always helpful. Crisis work is tough and the time off really helped. Definitely a field you have to come in mentally prepared for. Work is rewarding that we did. Sad that management failed to renew our contract and laid off our entire department unexpectedly prior to the holidays. 
Elevance Health,Business Consultant,4,A lot of opportunities for growth and self improvement. Not very competitive when it comes to salary but good benefits make up for that. Hybrid work model for most positions.
Elevance Health,WFM Manager ,2,"Worked for Anthem/Elevance for 18 years, Leadership changes constantly and outsourcing basically dissolved my position. Layoffs happen every quarter so your job scared all the time. No matter how productive you are they will lay you off!"
Elevance Health,Customer Service Representative,5,What is the best part of working at the company?They was very understand about people having a personal life What is the most stressful part about working at the company?They switched up at the last year
Elevance Health,Network Relations Manager,2,"I wouldn't recommend Elegance to my worst enemy. We were frequently told with zero notice that we were to work mandatory overtime, even as salaried employees who would receive no extra compensation. Multiple ethical concerns that were brought to leadership were ignored. During the layoffs in 2023, the team was already understaffed and unable to manage the workload but 50% of the team was let go and when asked how we would manage the workload the manager said, ""That's for you to figure out if you don't want to be in the next round of layoffs"".Horrible place to work."
Elevance Health,Claims Representative I (Remote),3,"I've worked for EH for almost two years. My first manager was THE BEST. She was the one who hired me and our personalities matched so well. Then after about a year, my team changed and she took over another team and I got a new manager. It was about every 6mo that this happened again. Since beginning this position, I've had five different managers, one of which changed while I was on leave. The inconsistency with management is a big disappointment. My position is remote. The pay is not great, less than $20/hr for a level 1 position., but I'm not spending any money on gas, so I guess that helps a little. It's very hard to get PTO approved since they only allow so many people to be off per day so don't wait until the end of the year to use your PTO as you can only roll-over so much of it to the next year or it goes into your sick-day bank.The benefits are pretty good. Medical/Dental/Vision for myself + kids is affordable but the deductible/OOP is higher. I like that they offer rewards for completing tasks/appointments throughout the year. I put those towards my HSA for the next year.I wish that we had more team meetings during the week. With my first team/manager, we met several times a week, which was GREAT. Even if it was just for a short 15-20 min meeting to catch up with everyone. It breaks the day up when working from home. My current team, we're lucky if we have one meeting every two weeks.Overall, I'm grateful for the experience this position has given me. It's opened up a door into the healthcare industry for me that I can use towards future opportunities."
Elevance Health,Processor,5,"Good company to work for. Training was excellent, make sure to pay attention and take plenty of notes. It’s a fun job once you know what you’re doing."
Elevance Health, Utilization Management,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Remote work from home, that's itWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Micromanage in the wound UM department. Even have to clock in out to go to the restroom What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very controlling, poor work life balanceWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Very busy, frustrating that our quota is tied to home care companies who do not return phone calls or needed information"
Elevance Health,Certified Pharmacy Technician (CPhT),2,"They give you the offer of working hybrid, but then dangle it in front of you saying you need to do this and that to MAYBE get the wfh option. The policies are constantly changing, they don’t allow you to request off days if you don’t have pto. Management is a mess as well as the pharmacist team (they constantly contradict each other). You’re never told any words of encouragement from managers or any higher up people. They constantly talk about the failures and errors made by the pharmacy technician team.They punish us as a whole, if a team in indiana does something wrong then ALL the teams throughout the US must face consequences for it.The only good thing is the coworkers you make because we’re all stuck in this together"
Elevance Health,Architecture,2,"Elevance Health provides competitive salaries. If you have stocks, Elevance would be a good place, as the stock is expected to do well in future. The bonus structure is good as well."
Elevance Health,Provider Network Manager,4,Not very enjoyable constantly fixing other peoples mistakes.  Top heavy.  Poor direction.  Ever changing processes with no training. Siloed. They do have great benefits. 
Elevance Health,Associate Behavioral Health Manager,4,The job I had was contract work so our work model was different than the standard of the company. Therefore we often ran into trouble when having to connect with HR for assistance with resolving issues or tasks. Overall the main company seems good and does prioritize work/life balance. 
Elevance Health,"Indianapolis, IN",5,There are many opportunities for growth.  This is a very diverse company that values both the employee and customers.  There are many areas to explore career wise.
Elevance Health,Customer Service Representative,1,Do not work here. Management is horrible. Especially on the GBD side. You will not be protected if something happens. The list goes on but apply somewhere else.
Elevance Health,Director,3,"Overall a good company to work for, but you better be lucky to land in the right area with the right leadership in place. The leadership is what can make or break the job for you. Also, lots of lay offs that happen throughout the year that seems to be the norm. "
Elevance Health,Crisis Counselor,4,Great experience. When it first started it was more relaxed . It eventually became too automated like a call center . But overall I great place older untill I found what I wanted 
Elevance Health,LTSS Service Coordinator,4,"honestly the workload can get heavy at times, but very rewarding job nonetheless. you will have all the support you need from peers, and the teamwork aspect is great depending on communication."
Elevance Health,CSR I,3,"The micromanaging is overwhelming, you do more work than what you're paid for. The bonuses are lackluster.  During training, they make you feel like you're going to be supported, but throw you to the sharks as soon as training is over and make you feel crazy if you tell them you feel like you're drowning. A lackluster experience all around. The benefits are pretty good though."
Elevance Health,Manager of Behavioral Health Grievance and Appeals,1,"Workplace culture is: work until work done, regardless of barrie4rs to succeed. Lack of acknowledgement for well done work...just do better! No compassion for hard work. If your direct reports are loyal to you, you will have support to succeed. Don't expect Elevance to teach you how to be a leader. Don't expect Sr. Leadership to be held accountable for bad behavior.. ""it's the doctor, their decision is final"" - don't question it unless you want to be forced out."
Elevance Health,UM Coordinator,2,"As freedom /optimum it had a mom and pop feel however once it became anthem and now elevance so much has change ,micromanaging ,layoffs , eliminating positions "
Elevance Health,Team Lead,3,"Day to day is pretty manageable, there is a big focus on budget which often leaves us with insufficient staffing to accomplish expectations. They are now pushing to move from fully remote to hybrid forcing employees back into the office, and no one can provide an explanation as to why or what they hope to accomplish with this. They tell managers the focus is on retention and keeping turnover down so they cater to the bad apples to try to talk them out of quitting. Meanwhile the good worker bees are ignored and unappreciated. Over the years they have continued to raise expectation and job requirements, without taking any responsibilities away. At this point the goals are not achievable which sets employees up to feel like they have failed. Despite being a huge company, there are very few job postings for upward growth, career feels stagnant. Medical plans are expensive and have a lot of exclusions. "
Elevance Health,Care Manager,1,"We had several metrics they wanted us to meet and did nothing when told the phone system would kick us out. During training, preceptor taught how to work around that then they fired 4 of us (including the preceptor) even thought we only had to do the work around bc we were efficient at our jobs and got the calls done in the beginning of the day. Terminated immediately and didn’t care when we tried to explain. After we left, they emailed the team and found 8 others having the same issue. "
Elevance Health,UM Nurse,4,Great place to work. Great people. Training is great. Too many changes at one time takes place leaving no room of carefully grasping stuff. Pay is average. Management was supportive
Elevance Health,Central ,3,"Hard to keep up with upper management. Once a week we get emails about new VPs in positions, new reorganizations, new branding, name changes.. seems like new people start higher up, make changes they want, then leave. The next person comes in and the cycle repeats. The organization is fine, but moving up is tough and there are always hiring freezes and recently lots of position eliminating. It's hard to stay optimistic about my job and the company when there are always changes. Anthem medicare is also very outdated with marketing material and outreach. Our competition is doing much better in this realm with better results. It makes it very hard to compete when we don't have approved material that we NEED in order to sell. Upper management wants feedback but never does anything with it. Overall an okay company, I expected more with such a well known organization, but it's very silo driven, disorganized, and lacks transparency. "
Elevance Health,Triage Specialist,5,This is a great company to work for. Pay and benefits are great! Great fertility reimbursement as well. You get a  bonus and pay rise every year.  Lots of opportunity to grow 
Elevance Health,anonymous,4,"This is good job. Nothing else to say except that too many layoffs as well.Good people, good culture, good opportunities, benefits and steady workplace"
Elevance Health,LPN,5,"Good benefits, nice place to work, great schedule, decent patient load, good communication, easy access computer system, good compensation, easy access management. "
Elevance Health,Business Change Manager Sr,2,Management was untruthful. Said one thing during meetings but did other things behind ones back. Very untrustworthy. Good part was management was not micro managing. Trusted to get your work completed.
Elevance Health,Process Expert Sr.,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Training and advancement opportunities What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Aggressive timelines for deliverables
Elevance Health,Nurse Reviewer,3,Great place to work in terms of management and support. Dislike taking calls and not very flexible with hours you work. They try to provide PTO as often as you wish which is nice 
Elevance Health,Customer Service Representative,3,"I worked here for the last 17 years. When I first started in 2007 management ans the company  (named Wellpoint at the time) was amazing. I loved my job felt and felt like I was actually helping people and doing some good. Unfortunately one day that all changed. I thought the pay was good until I looked online and found out with my experience I was way under paid. When you start they talk about how you can move up, promotions and your quarterly/annual bonuses. What they don't tell you is that if your manager doesn't like you or if you are not one of their favorites you may never see a promotion and they have the right to take your bonuses away, that you earned. This job became very stressful. I mean so stressful it was hard to sleep some nights. I found out I was not alone with these feelings. However management is not very understanding so its difficult to express yourself. Also, the way you are treated by management, no communication back sometimes when you reach out to them. Also lack of training on new to you products or systems. When I first started I had 6 weeks of training. For the new to me products it was barley 1 week of training. Once trained on the new to me products you are thrown in being told you are the proficient professional, however not feeling confident at all. I don't think they understand how stressful this can be. Not only that but the micromanagement causes unnecessary stress. Asking for help can sometimes fall on deaf ears. When I first started this company was amazing after 17 years I think it's time for them to look back at what they used go do going - more..."
Elevance Health,CCR,5,Great work place. Love my supervisor always willing to help. Any questions I have they will get answered. Been the greatest 6 months with this company. Highly recommended to anybody who is looking for a job
Elevance Health,Benefits Coordinator,3,"Benefits could be better, very unorganized but love working remotely. Co workers were helpful, lack of training . No room for growth in the department "
Kroger,Delivery Driver,3,"good job until closed location, everyone laid off. co workers were cool. job not too hard. managers were ok, didn't really have power. out of touch corporate makes the rules"
Kroger,Stocker,5,Fun workplace management would micro manage you all the time things where easy one you learn everything overall not a bad job experience other than the dirty floors
Kroger,Baker,1,"Worst job ever, if you want to be over worked and underpaid and under appreciated this is the place management is terrible , and get paid to stand around and talk all day instead care about their department, they have no hours/labor and complain there’s no one to keep the fresh departments open, they intentionally set you up to fail, seriously just stay away your sanity and mental health will thank you."
Kroger,Produce Clerk,4,"Nice place to work, coworkers make it bearable. Customers can be 50/50. Sometimes the management expects a miracle when we don’t have product to work with but it is what it is "
Kroger,Grocery Clerk/Dairy Clerk/Frozen Clerk,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Good company to work for as far as benefits go. My experience is that management is terrible, dishonest and willing to use any employee. I was told that I was needed to work in a new department that was short-staffed (this was supposed to be temporary seasonal work) for two-months. I agreed and they still wouldn't move me back to my hired position 2 years later.. When I quit they decided they could hire me back into my original position.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?My answer to that question would simply be Management; nothing more nothing less.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The company overall seems to be a good company work for. They seem to me to be up-to-date with trends and things of the like. They also have wonderful programs set in place to encourage further education for their employees. I wish they would have treated the Covid issue differently. Who really knew what to do though..What is a typical day like for you at the company?This is somewhat difficult to answer due to management moving me around so much so I will answer broadly. Get to work early so that I might get an understanding of what to expect for that day (not many pep talks or start-of-shift meetings), clock-in, once finding out daily objective, work fast to get it done due to high quotas, help customers if situation arises. work until everything is completed, clock-out when every objective is met (even if past designated 'end-of-shift'.  Couldn't leave work until everything was finished. - more..."
Kroger,Co-Manager/Store Manager,4,"It was my first job out of college.  I stayed longer than I should have in one position, as a co-manager.  Over all the company was pretty good.  I have kept in touch with some of them managers"
Kroger,Cashier,5,This job made for a wonderful work experience. I learned a lot. This was my first job and I really enjoyed working here.  My position was temporary but I would work for this employer again.
Kroger,Meat Clerk,3,Part time pays a lot less. You may or may not join union. You can get insurance. You have flexibility in your schedule.Full time pays a lot more but harder to get. Supposedly you do not have a choice in your schedule.
Kroger,Cashier/Online Shopper,4,"I would 100% work for Kroger again. However, Kroger is known for wanting to run ghost crews, they shove a lot of work onto one person. So the work that 7 people should be doing, there’s only 1 or 2. They also will make you work every single department regardless if you want to or not. There were no drug tests, and you get one week of paid vacation after a year. "
Kroger,stocker,3,"the workplace and coworkers were nice, easy work. the management would make you want to quit tho, very rude & horsey. Customers and very loud and belligerent"
Kroger,Rotation clerk,2,"Its a typical retail job.  Of course that means you have to deal with the public daily (which can be good and bad), won't get paid much, and won't be appreciated by management.  Oh, you'll also have to work weekends and holidays.  I wouldn't recommend working at Kroger."
Kroger,Clerk,1,"While the job itself would be simple, there's not enough people staffed in my department.  Schedules are made and out out last minute. If I put in a request for a day off it's never denied or approved. My department manager literally complains the entire shift - never any praise or Thanks. Other departments are also over worked and under staffed. The managers only care about bonuses. We're just numbers to them. They let people work while they are sick and if you're someone who calls out while sick, the managers retaliate and give you less hours (even if you have a doctors note!). I could go on and on. "
Kroger,Grocery Clerk,1,"Employees in Kroger are very overworked and very underpaid. There are no opportunities for advancement, no benefits, and management does not promote growth."
Kroger,Fulfillment Associate,3,Good pay and opportunity for overtime. Nice people but work is tedious but easy. Work in an ambient or chill environment. 10 hour shifts and part time plus full time opportunities 
Kroger,Produce Clerk,4,"At the location where I worked, the managers were good, the work was somewhat repetitive but that was to be expected, the opportunity for long-term growth, insurance and many benefits after the first year."
Kroger,Cashier,2,Union dues eat up a lot of your salary.  Management thinks they are superior and doesn’t trust employees.   Working in the fuel station there was hardly anyone to cover needed breaks.  
Kroger,Day Coordinator,3,Some locations and positions are better than others. Lead positions are much harder than you think. Dairy Lead was a disaster for me. Understaffed all the time. But the bright and colorful environment of dayshift is nice and i had a great experience at store 752. 
Kroger,Pharmacy Technician,1,"Worked at the pharmacy and I have never seen such a cliquey place since high school. Expected you to handle irate customers on the phone, count pills, while somehow fully understanding  old systems at the same time. Don't bother asking for help as everyone else is also under a ton of stress and will snap at you. Customers are already angry before you know what's going on. You are completely set up to feel like a failure on day one."
Kroger,Assistant manager ,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Servicing customer, great benefits, good payWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Teenage associates that are not disciplined that we have to literally babysit to get to do their job, unionizedWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very interesting and varying throughout different licationsWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Very extremely busy days, lots of customers as well as lots of associates"
Kroger,Cashier,2,"It’s a fine place to work as a teenager or if you are still in school with people who can support you due to the pay not being the best. There is very little autonomy. Supervisor will tell you what to do when to do it, when to take your lunch, when to change positions etc. Despite this, I did form nice relationships with my coworkers."
Kroger,ecommerce Lead,2,What is the best part of working at the company?it's an okay company to work for. the pay is very low but there are some other benefits that help some. most of the people I work with are solid folks.

Kroger,GM Clerk | Grocery Stocker,3,"This company is not an excellent place to work long term. Its hard to become full time. I learned, when they lie to you in an interview, already start looking for new employment."
Kroger,Customer Service,4,"Love the people I work with and mostly everyone gets along quite well. It gets super busy sometimes, especially when understaffed but we make it work and figure it out "
Kroger,Cashier,2,most days ere the same i just helped customers through checkout and went home. the customers are rude and management expects no words. i just let them handle it. 
Kroger,Bakery Clerk,3,"50/50 job in my opinion . I had no training as a bakery clerk at that location but once I moved to a cashier I had training there but not enough support. It’s. Nice first job to build your retail ,grocery career but I wouldn’t stay there long term"

Kroger,Retail Associate,3,Stocked and conditioned shelves  overnight ensuring customers had a fresh shopping experience during store operating hours. Helped customers find items if needed. 
Kroger,Csdd,4,Consistently get off at the same time and have a set schedule. Some days can be stressful with a lot of driving . Lately it seems like the company has cut back on office and warehouse staffing which is frustrating for everyone.
Kroger,Project Manager,4,A great job with a vast amount of variety. We work hard to solve challenging issues in our department and use our team skills to ensure things flow smoothly
Kroger,Clicklist Associate,3,"Honestly it's not bad at first but once you hit a certain amount of weeks or months being there, it's exhausting. 1. constantly being stopped by customers to help them find something; which wouldn't be so bad if you weren't  being timed. (which you have to maintain a certain speed, even with big orders) 2. It get's repetitive after awhile "
Kroger,Deli clerk ,1,"After the new CEO took over some years ago, Kroger went down hill.Low pay is being blamed on the Union and the managers are bonus driven.Broken equipment doesn't get fixed, part timers get their hours cut, in order for the store manager to get a higher bonus.The employees don't get bonuses, not even for Christmas.If you are a great worker, they will pile more work on top of you. They will call you on your day off to work, while managers take their day off or just stand around cracking the whip on your back."

Kroger,Kitchen Manager,4,"I worked at [Company Name] for [Duration], and overall, my experience was positive. The company culture is supportive and fosters collaboration, which made the work environment engaging.

Kroger,Cashier/Sales Associate,2,"Good days,Bad days,slowdays,hectic days, working for a big corporate is not all its cracked up to be.  Management is Never stable.  It is Never Ending and Stressful . Either too many Employees or Not Enough. Watching the poor staff, Suffer.Physically & mentally. Meeting most of the customers is a Blessing."
Kroger,Customer Service Representative,1,"i cannot speak for how the experience is working in the actual stores but would i recommend working for their corporate office? absolutely not. when i first started working for kroger's corporate office in salt lake city, i did rather enjoy it very much and was very happy there and got along great with my supervisors and loved how laid back it was and not so strict. ever since early 2022, working for this company caused me so much stress and anxiety and i no longer looked forward to working there. they had these ""service planners"" come in and start making a whole lot of changes which i understand change is necessary as a company grows but it's the way that this company HANDLED the changes is what really frustrated me. when a change was made in the department i worked in they wouldn't communicate it well to everyone and they automatically expected everyone to just know what to do and they would expect you to still meet the goals and it was very clear they only cared about numbers and never quality of work so nothing would actually get worked properly causing our department to drown in more work each and every day. seniority also doesn't mean ANYTHING to this company as they recently laid off a lot of employees from my department including myself and other departments within kroger. i used to get told by my direct supervisors that i was an asset to this company and that they wouldn't get rid of my role because of how much i contributed to our department.. only for kroger to throw me away like i was a piece of garbage despite how long i worked there. i even saw them lay off - more..."

Kroger,Clicklist Associate,3,"There were lot of orders and not much down downtime. You stay busy, but the time will go by quick though. management was decent, and coworkers were chill."
Kroger,Clerk/Cashier,5,Loved working here. I learned a lot and the work environment was wonderful. It was my second job as a teenager and I would recommend it to anyone else.
Kroger,Grocery Clerk,4,"The management does not care if you have an issue that arises that requires you to change your availability, and they are not concerned with helping you resolve these issues. There is a lot of arguing and talking about members of the staff among coworkers, including many members of management. The amount of work expected to be completed by one employee alone in one area, on a shift where there are over 9 pallets of product being delivered that are not separated by product type, while still managing to keep up on the usual work for a typical day is absolutely impossible to complete, and the managers of that department treat you like you are lazy, while telling other coworkers that you just can't do what you are expected to do. No one watches the doors for the night shift employees to gain entry to the building, nor do they answer the phone, so that you can alert them that you are trying to enter. They are aware that the doorbell does not work, but do not have any plans to fix it, at this point.  "
Kroger,Starbucks Shift Supervisor,1,not a good time. lots of drama and not a good work environment. decent benefits but not worth it to me. seems like you have a good experience if you’re close to management and know how to work em.  there’s better out there.

Kroger,Gas Technician,4,"Expectations were reasonable and straight forward. Bathroom breaks were tricky but manageable. You work by yourself, and checkout customers. There is a regular closing routine to follow and it is safe! "
Kroger,Stocker/Cashier,1,It sucks because it’s not fun work and it’s very unhealthy for you to work at a place like Kroger with all the toxic co workers you have to put up with
Kroger,Store Associate,5,"A typical day at work is clocking in, getting your assessments done, then putting your apron and tag on and getting to work. I learned to have patience, be respectful to others around you, and greet everyone with a calm manner, the workplace itself gets a bit overwhelming but my favorite job so far, hardest part of the job was the early mornings if your not an early bird. Everything about the job I enjoyed. "
Kroger,Stocker,1,"Don’t expect to be trained, they will make you do their Kroger company training videos then throw you to the wild for your job and if your lucky enough to get taught anything it still won’t be enough and when you try to adapt to get the job done it’s wasted movement. Don’t work at this place it’s a joke "
Kroger,Supervisor,3,"I started as a bagger and then a cashier then making it to a supervisor, it is a great place to learn and get experience. I would say management could be better but the change so often it ok"
Kroger,Pickup Lead,1,Extreme business with limited payroll & poor staff. Typical grocery environment. Very rude customers who are entitled. Management had no idea what was even happening in the pickup department.
Kroger,Cashier,2,"Long, boring hours standing on your feet. I didn't have many problems related to customer service. Generally speaking, people were pretty nice to me. "
Kroger,Inventory Supervisor,3,"Turnover rate is high, no proper training. Associates and supervisors mix!!! Upper management doesn’t know how to talk to each other. Supervisor pinned against each other. "

Kroger,Cashier,3,Ok place to work now he people are noce and there is always something to do there is always someone to help and there are managers to give you something to do
Kroger,Associate Cashier,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Nothing about this company would make me want to go back and work for them. The management is very disrespectful to their employees. They won’t even take employees to get serious injuries checked out.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The area manager is never in the area but expects all the hourly employees to get their work done for them What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very stressful and hostile environment What is a typical day like for you at the company?Just knowing that I had to work caused an anxiety attack
Kroger,Production Supervisor,4,"Floor associates are easy to get along with, upper management is very disconnected and doesn’t communicate well or are only there during the morning shift"

Kroger,Department Manager,1,"Over-worked and underpaid is the constant here. Micromanaged. Employees are backstabbing, two-faced scoundrels. Gossiping like a clique of schoolgirls. Horrendous training!!  Five different people will train you five different ways and every way is, technically, wrong. Understaffed!!  It's sad what this company has become. If you have thick skin and no other options, you can survive here, but that's about it. Join The Union!!!  Otherwise, you'll be lied to and talked advantage of and abused. The Union will protect you. They're there for a reason. "
Kroger,Grocery Stock Clerk,3,Trust no one. Worry about yourself.Encourages complacency. Laid back. Easy work. There's nothing hard about Kroger except working with a skeleton crew and lazy people. 
Kroger,Pickup Clerk,3,"You go in, you do your job, you leave. It's pretty simple. But with management changing every few months you can't really feel like you know where you stand or get comfortable."

Kroger,Deli Associate/Customer Service,2,"My  experience was ok, but management was very terrible they can't do there job right. They don't help out when it's needed, very unprofessional, if they don't like you they will find ways to get you terminated at its finest. They do show favorites. Your benefit won't activate until the next year following. Basically too many chiefs and not enough Indians . Job is stressful they don't pay you for your experience basically under pay. Depending how long you work there it gets hirer. "
Kroger,Stocker,3,"They expect a lot from you. And honestly, I feel like management doesn't hire enough people, so you're stuck doing a lot of overtime. But overall, I would say I enjoy the job."
Kroger,Produce Clerk,3,Decent job. Good for younger people as it’s pretty active and you need to be able to lift at least 50 lbs. Very physical. Be prepared to start out with evening hours. There is a union if needed.
Kroger,NP,2,management needs improvement. the communication at this company is horrible and really affects the staff. there is good autonomy but overall have not had a good
Kroger,Sales Associate,3,"Good for starting with work experience. Can be long hour and management is hit or miss. The pay is okay for the position, but you can learn a handful of skills that can benefit you moving forward."
Kroger,Deli and bakery Clerk,2,"No training, no advancement, very cliquey,  poor management-if any. Nepotism rages. No work life balance, unless you were hired because of nepotism. If you work bad and are a rude young girl who plays dumb or are dumb, you will become a favorite and just get to talk half your shift while others do their work and more. People constantly quit because of the poor attitude towards customers and value of the department as a whole. "
Kroger,Deli Clerk,4,"Great job if you are willing to work hard at times. Coworkers were great but clean up is extensive. Overall not a bad job, but the training period does leave a lot to be desired."
Kroger,Sales Associate,5,I enjoy working with my co workers and managers. super friendly people. honest environment. decent pay. you can connect with customers and the regulars.
Kroger,Online Grocery Pickup Associate,5,"This was a chill position and schedule is flexible. We sometimes helped on the floor (bagging, moving product to the front) if it was slow. Shopping is fun for me so i enjoyed it."
Kroger,Assistant Store Leader,5,"I love working for this company. I have been able to excel in my career goals and experiences while working here. Working for a corporate business has taught me a lot of necessary skills needed to continue my growth within this field as well as others. I have managed over 300 associates at one time and have learned the importance of critical thinking, teamwork, active listening and so much more. It has been a wonderful experience and I am excited for what's next. "
Kroger,Pharmacy Technician,3,Unfortunately hired after a new system was initiated and hours were slashed in half. It was nice to have weekly pay. Felt bad for staff that had their hours cut. 
Kroger,Natural Foods Manager,4,"You have alot of room to move up and grow within the company, just work hard and be reliable. Also they pat weekly, you get vacations,great health insurance too."
Kroger,Delivery Driver,3,Communication with HR is not the best if you need something go directly to HR then let your supervisor now. Workload can be heavy depending on the day 
Kroger,Order Selector,4,Selecting items from the warehouse while operating a pallet jack. Physical work and lost weight while working there. Not a bad job but getting the hang of how to build each pallet so it doesn't tip over can be challenging
Kroger,Cart Pusher,3,"Working at Kroger started out promising but quickly became disheartening due to the presence of biased managers. There’s a clear favoritism that affects both opportunities for growth and the overall work environment. Unfortunately, decisions seemed to be based less on merit and more on personal connections or arbitrary factors."
Kroger,Courtesy Clerk,3," worked at Kroger as my first job, and overall, it was an okay experience. The pay was decent for an entry-level position, but nothing spectacular. It’s a good place to gain some work experience and get used to the basics of customer service, but the job itself can be repetitive and tiring at times. The hours were manageable, though shifts could sometimes be long and the work physically demanding, especially if you're stocking or bagging. The work environment was fine, though it could get hectic during busy periods, like holidays or weekends. Management was hit or miss—some supervisors were helpful and understanding, while others weren’t as engaged. Co-workers were generally friendly, which made the shifts a bit more bearable. In summary, Kroger is a decent option for a first job. You won’t be blown away, but if you’re looking for something that pays alright and provides flexible hours, it works. Just don’t expect it to be a long-term career move unless you’re aiming for advancement within the company."
Kroger,Pickup Associate,2,Never able to keep up with ridiculous amount of orders. 70-300 orders depending on which day of the week. Even slammed on slower days because they cut everyone’s hours and we literally don’t have the man power to keep up. Always needed to push every order back by an hour or so pretty much every day. All managers in the pickup department all day every day. Dangerous work environment. Dangerous drivers with no speed bumps in sight. See a handful of people who nearly get ran over pretty much every day. Scummy management. Very two faced leadership and a bunch of soft spined chumps who would never try to get things changed for us in there. It’s embarrassing just the sheer level of chaos that was in pickup every day.
Kroger,Cashier/Customer Service,3,"""I worked at Kroger for a while as a cashier. The job had its ups and downs, but I gained useful customer service experience. It was a fast-paced environment, and I learned a lot about handling different types of transactions and assisting customers with their needs. Overall, it was a good opportunity to develop skills that are valuable in other roles."""
Kroger,Assistant Meat Manager,3,"I worked for Kroger for Eleven years and it had its highs and lows. Originally I started orvernight stocking groceries for 3rd shift. Went to days a year and half later working days in dairy and moved over to meat and seafood after two years. Durring my time there I learned the inner workings of the department and worked with some pretty good people . Supervisors were pretty good for the most part and I got certified as a meat cutter (which I enjoyed doing). Eventually I put in for a mgmt position and got it. I passed my certification and did that the last four plus years working for Kroger.As I stated before it's not a bad place to work. There's opportunities for advancement and opportunities to learn new skills. That was the best part of the job for me. The company provides pretty good benefits (pay was good too for the area I was working in) including a certain % match on 401k. The only real downside to the company is the constant influx of poorly knowledgeable middle mgmt. These people have no purpose but to drive employees, supervisors, store mgmt and even potential customers crazy. The store I worked at for five years was dragged through the mud for corporate visits. They put the importance of a division president or CEO first and the customers needs second. To me that is wrong, the store should look great and be staffed everyday. Not just when a corporate bigwig decides the need to feel important.   Overall they're an ok company with decent pay, solid benefits and opportunities for advancement. Just avoid dealing with middle mgmt people as much as possible. They'll - more..."

Kroger,Courtesy Clerk,1,It’s too cliquey… Especially in this location. Girls in lower management (supervisors) talk a bunch of junk about you. Hateful people in this location Written for my specific location 
Kroger,Cashier,4,Not a great place to work.  People are so inconsiderate of others.  Overuse you and then toss you away.  Everyone is replaceable to most companies anymore. 
Kroger,Clicklist Associate,2,Constantly understaffed and the other associates are expected to cover it. Very few members of management have any kind of backbone. Promotions based on who you’re friends with instead of work ethic.
Kroger,Certified Pharmacy Technician,4,"It’s a good job. The pay is not competitive, benefits are pretty good. No direct access to Human Resources or ability to discuss pay or raises. Overall though it’s a good job."

Kroger,E-Commerce Clerk,3,"This place was my first job, a good first job but I am ready for different opportunities. They are unionized, and just about anyone can do it. One thing I did not like was the stress. It is a fast paced environment with lots of walking. I recommend for High schoolers or College Students "

Kroger,Team Member,5,"Learned a lot. Good workplace,managemnet culture. Met a lot of good people during my time here at kroger. Fast paced environment in the everyday works"
Kroger,General Labor,5,12 hour shifts. (3) 20 min breaks. The pay is on par however years ago they use to set the standard. Turn over is high. Most employers seem unhappy. The benefits are some of the best in the industry!!! Over all it’s a fair place with the ability to improve much. Only time will tell.
Kroger,Order Selector,3,Physically draining as hours are unpredictable while lifting tens of thousands of pounds of freight daily (between 40k on 90k) but if you go faster you can get aid more.Management is usually polite and so are other employees. However seniority is a big deal so career advancement and flexibility is poor.
Kroger,Deli Clerk,1,Toxic management; but the best coworkers. I trained so many people in the time I was there. Make sure don't overwhelmed yourself. Always call if you're running late.
Kroger,Meat Manager,1,Kroger is a very selfish underpaid and selfish company. The union with kroger is all about money not employees. They use to care kroger is slowly declining as a company. There is never enough help and store managers rarely pull up there sleeve and help you! 
Kroger,Cashier/Customer Service,5,"Paid weekly fun environment . Friendly and fasted environment. You learn customer service, how to work under pressure and handle complex problems and difficult customers"
Kroger,Cashier,1,"Most of the managers and supervisors are rude, impatient, and all around not friendly, I just started collage and let them know that when I was in the hiring proccess and was told my hours are flexable, I applied for part time and they have me scheduled for 35 hours a week, so I asked about cutting my hours and my manager was not so happy, and said *probably not* In a rude tone, when all in all I'm a good worker, but have no time or energy to work *that* much, because I have class and home life things to take care of. All in all, they are *not* flexible, they are liars. Also 35 should not be considered part time, that's insanity."

Ford Motor Company,Scheduler,3,Scheduling activity was a good place to work.  Repetitive work either on weekly or monthly cadences. Ability to move around and gain knowledge of entire activity. Very silo driven work. Collaboration can be good depending on quality and objectives of peers. Rewarding to be tied to production and customers.  Some jobs can be unevenly balanced within the week. Too much movement within roles and specializing is discouraged.
Ford Motor Company,Technician,3,"My experience at Ford was generally positive, especially when it came to people management. The team culture was supportive, and I appreciated the open communication and collaboration among colleagues. Management was approachable and genuinely cared about employee development, making it a great place to grow and learn. The work environment was professional yet comfortable, and I always felt like part of a cohesive unit.However, despite the strong people management, I found the compensation to be below expectations. For the level of work and expertise required, the pay didn’t fully align with industry standards. While the benefits and opportunities for growth were a plus, the lower salary made it challenging to stay long-term. Overall, if Ford could improve its compensation packages, it would be an even more attractive place to work for both experienced professionals and those entering the industry."

They took the time to understand my needs and guided me through the entire process with professionalism and patience.The selection of vehicles was impressive, and I found exactly what I was looking for at a great price.

Ford Motor Company,Senior Software Engineer,1,"Pros:-Decent benefits and pay if you live in the midwest.Cons:- Awful, out-of-touch management- RTO Initiatives- PM's/People Leaders will throw engineers under the bus at every turn- Awful tech stack that is an amalgamation of a bunch of very old, deprecated technologies piled on top of each other from years and years of contractor turnover.- NO LOCAL DEVELOPMENT! The CMS that we were using was so poorly setup and configured, and the environments so disparate, that when I started we had no way of running the site locally on our machines. This means every change would take from five minutes to up to an hour just to deploy so that we could view our changes on the dev site.- Extremely high turnover, contractors were hired for a year and then the whole lot gets terminated.- Insane pressure on high performers. If you were good at your job, you'd be expected to pick up the slack of your deadbeat co-workers who couldn't code their way out of a wet paper bag. This resulted in frequent overtime and off-hours emergency calls to get things in before some arbitrary deadline.I don't care how good the offer is, if you get a job as a web dev on any of the ford/lincoln web teams, run for your life; it's not worth it."

Ford Motor Company,Software Engineer,3,"A typical day consists of requirements analysis, software development or ISSUES analysis, a lot of Open Source is worked but also licensed software, work culture is good"
Ford Motor Company,Production Worker,4,Good pay good benefits nice people to work long as you keep that line running and do your job they don’t bother you be expected to do repetitive work.
Ford Motor Company,Assembly Line Operator,4,"Very good pay. Tasks very repetitive. On your feet the entire shift. Day work Mon - Fri, and finish at 12:30 on a Friday. Fast paced, so you have to keep up with the line., else you get “spoken” to. Very little overtime. Some of the management really good, some left a lot to be desired. I though did enjoy my time there on a one year contract. "
Ford Motor Company,Manager,1,Bad management. Good old boys club. Need to find a different role. This place is a bureaucratic mess. Do not wish this role upon anyone. Need to leave for sure 
Ford Motor Company,Assembly Line Worker,3,While the pay and benefits are good it didn’t outweigh the negatives. You are truly just another number here. Long hours you will be sore! They really lack on employee training but a real quick to discipline with suspensions. Hopefully you never have to go to the restroom because you can be stuck waiting for hours to go. Getting time off is near impossible and if you call off there are major consequences. 
Ford Motor Company,Production Associate,3,The money and benefits are top of the game while the environment is a bit toxic and they play favorites for everything. If you want a good job you better make sure your best friends with your supervisor because seniority doesn’t even matter anymore.
Ford Motor Company,Unknown,3,Doing practices in a Ford plant is an enriching experience that gives students the opportunity to apply their academic knowledge in a real and dynamic manufacturing environment.

Ford Motor Company,Energy Management Engineer ,4,"It truly is a great place towork. Good work live balance. Only problem is to switch from a half time to a full time job, because there are just a few spaces "
Ford Motor Company,Vat,2,Union throws you under the bus quick you better study the union contract yourself bc you can't depend on any rep to be genuine. Over stressed underpaid 
Ford Motor Company,Automotive Technician,3,"Management was sub par, and there is a huge lack in communication. Overall not bad but there is definitely better. Past 4 years I was there nearly 40 people came and went. "
Ford Motor Company,Account Manager,3,"Good benefits and decent pay,People who work harder get compensated and rewarded the same as those that do the bare minimum so no real incentive to do better "
Ford Motor Company,Electronics Engineer,5,"Working at Ford in the IT department has been an engaging and fulfilling experience. The company provides a strong work-life balance, with competitive salary packages and comprehensive benefits. There are numerous opportunities for professional development and career advancement, making it an ideal place for long-term career growth. Management is supportive and open to new ideas, fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration.

Ford Motor Company,Parts Specialist/ driver,1,What is the best part of working at the company?There really wasn't any good part except maybe the discount for cars and parts What is the most stressful part about working at the company?All of it. I was working as a counterman and doing everything but being paid as a driver so minimum wage in rhe 5 years I worked there What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It was very much like being back in elementary school thry talked to yoy like yoy were a little kid and treated you like slaves What is a typical day like for you at the company?Well it was all stressful you would be thrown in every which way and then you were blamed for stuff thst others did. It was a constant why am I even working here
Ford Motor Company,Mechanic,5,Good bunch off lads and as a company couldn't complain but workshop need sorting out and money put in to quality off the workshop and staff but is hopefully getting better 
Ford Motor Company,General Utility,2,"A typical work day is 10 hours five days a week, plus overtime if need based on if company decides they need it or not. It used to be be four ten hour days and overtime based on vehicles needed. They do offer classes to get into the skilled trades, which is plumbers, electricians, millwright. So I did take classes on how to read blueprints and graphs. But never got advanced into the trades, as there is a big waiting list. Management is very unstructured and micro manages every employee and plays favorites to certain people they like, or are family with. Also the vehicles are way more important then the employee. Hardest part is getting up and motivated to go to work there. And it's not enjoyable at all. Pay is good and benefits are really good. People only stay for the benefits."
Ford Motor Company,Team Lead & Developer Ford Motor Company (FMC),4,Very professional work culture and dedicated team of professionals. This workplace also caters a development and engineering section where ideas meet reality.
Verizon,Tech II,5,Great place to work with excellent benefits.  I really enjoyed working for Verizon and would work there again if the opportunity presents itself. I learned so much with the company.
Verizon,Program Manager,2,Stressful environment and unreasonable expectations.  Pay was not competitive for southern CA. Management was constantly changing and resigning.  Health insurance was competitive. 
Verizon,"Scrum Master/RTE/IT Project Manager Contractor, InfoSys/Innova Solutions",5,"What is the best part of working at the company?I worked with wonderdul IT teams with excellent skills.  The culture among the cross functional teams was motivating and very encouraging.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The ever changing release shedules that was a part of PMO.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great!  Continous learning and innovation was definitely a part of Verizon's culture.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Morning team calls, then Daily scrum calls and interation with other RTEs to modify and develop ARTs when needed."
Verizon,Sales,3,"High stress and not what it used to be. Some roles might be okay, but very dependent on leadership. Operate in silos and do not ever try to communicate with the ""higher ups."" Not a lot of mobility unless you are voluntold into a role."
Verizon,Alorica,3,There are no pros this job sucks. Call volume is ridiculous. Management is nowhere to be found when needed & they are very catty for no reason it reminded me of high school. 
Verizon,Member Service Representative,4,Great place to work at. Everyone is professional . Nice work life balance. Managers are always there to help. Good position if you want to elevate your interpersonal skills
Verizon,Tech Expert ,5,Great company and incentives great benefits and unlimited overtime offered quite often..very ethical place to work and s very robust human resources dept
Verizon,Store Manager (Management),4,"Great company from top to bottom, sales to technical support and management. Verizon sure knows how to do it. I recommend any and all to take advantage of an opportunity to be employed by Verizon where it be direct or an authorized retailer"
Verizon,Inside Sales Representative,3,"Verizon can be a really amazing place to work it's a very great opportunity for people who want full benefits.  I think that supervisors and training can be sharpened up to be better.   I think that job security can be tightened up and I think that when employees get laid off they should automatically be guaranteed to just move over to a different department, NOT APPLY just transfer  instead of struggling and scrambling to find another job after they've been with a company for 3 years with no worries for job security. When I first applied for the job I was under the impression that I would have great job security here based off the reviews and lengthy tenures of my peers.  I'm having to look for other jobs before the end date this month! It's competitive pay it's  410k everything above but none of that matters if you're not employed there anymore due to no fault of your own.You get offered a severance but 3 years tenure isn't the best for severance. Job security is the best and really only thing thats the most desirable attribute i expect from companies than anything else above pay and benefits. No one likes applying for jobs and starting over and struggling to learn stuff all over again and then by the time you learn everything and master it then you get laid off. Right in time for the holidays."
Verizon,Sales Associate,2,Associates only care about commissions and not offering good customer service. The Managers plays favorites and create a hostile work environment and frown upon requesting time off 
Verizon,Sales Associate,3,"Overall, a great place to learn how to sell and help people face to face. Learned skills such as opening and closing a store, cash handling and credit card processing  "
Verizon,Fios Technician/lineman,2,What is the best part of working at the company?The best part was the pay and medical insurance.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Now this wasn’t in every department but deftly Co-workers who were either with you or against which would turn out to being black balled by everyone.  And also the fact that supervisors knowing this would not do anything about it.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It is a very Toxic environment despite what training shows and tells you in Virginia. It seems great when in training at the headquarters in VA but it’s further from the truth when at your shopWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Depending where you worked was at times busy
Verizon,Customer Service Representative/Call Center,1,"Your completely on your own, management never wants to talk to customers....just tell you everything to say via group chat. All they care about is you up selling and punish you for assisting customers if they want to leave Verizon.....worst company I've ever worked for"
Verizon,Retail Sales Associate,3,Managers demand you upsell to customers that cant afford to be upsold. Only care about numbers so they can brag to their boss and act like they helped.
Verizon,Store Manager,4,Worked there for 10 years. Initially a great company with benefits and an upper leadership team who was supportive. Towards the end a lot of leadership changed and so did the culture. It went from an energizing we will get it done to leadership who blurred the lines of what’s acceptable and not and you were held accountable for things truly out of your control. I would recommend anyone to work here as the benefits are second to none but understand that comes with angst and anxiety to meet your leaderships demands. Would I do it again? Yes without a 2nd thought about it. What would I change? Upper leadership’s grasp on what works and what doesn’t. Stop moving the goal post so much and make changes the workforce is asking for much more quickly. 
Verizon,Tier 2 Technical Support,2,I worked for Verizon for over 12 years and probably would have done so until i retired.  Benefits were great and leadership did well to listen to frontline employees. There was a cultural shift in the last few years thought that shifted away from integrity and toward sales that I was not a fan of. 
Verizon,Inside Sales Representative,2,"Working for Verizon was really great until we started working remote. As an inside sales rep you're taught mainly to handle sales however because sales calls are low they ""open the Que"" to take calls from whoever Are calling in and you have to offer atleast 3 things on a non sales call. You will open every account and you can and will also get a survey on a no. Sales call. If the customer is already upset and many of them are that can and will also go against your shift. You are asked to do so much for so little pay. When and if overtime is available you will find yourself begging for sales. Verizon let go way over 2k customer service agents just to hire indirect representatives from the Philippines that hardly speak English and don't know anything so you get more calls dumped on you as a fake sale transfer. It's a never ending cycle that will have you going completely insane. They would have you bid for schedules with reps all over the country and it's unfair. Because people in California will take all of the morning shifts and leave the east coast on mid schedules. "
Verizon,Contracts & Billing Administrator,3,"Was OK as a starter job, but employees on the same level were cliquey and unpleasant to work with. There was room for career advancement but it wasn't really supported."
Verizon,Customer Service Representative,5,I enjoyed my time at Verizon and learned so much. The training helped me successfully help customers. I moved up fast. There are a ton of incentives and the benefits were great as well. 
Verizon,Sales Consultant,5,"I spent over 8 months with Verizon and had a blast, just do your job and you have nothing to worry about. Great commission checks, management was kind and understanding. "
Verizon,Member Technical Staff,5,This is a great place to work that gives you a lot of opportunity to work with new technologies. The work culture is great. Offers a great value to work-life balance.
Verizon,Tech II,5,Great place to work with excellent benefits.  I really enjoyed working for Verizon and would work there again if the opportunity presents itself. I learned so much with the company.
Verizon,Inside Sales Representative,5,My experience at Verizon was very pleasant . I had a clear career path and everyone that I knew there was happy to be there. The benefits and perks were amazing.
Verizon,Solutions Specialist,5,"My three years at verizon has been a Rollercoaster. Post covid I was hired, the company was worried about customer satisfaction management made sure all Ts were crossed and i's were dotted the perfect experience.  Since then the company/ management has been terrible, The work life balance does not exist with verizon do not work for this corporation if you love yourself. "
Verizon,CSR - Customer Service Representative,5,"Great Benefits, and work life balance. The culture is diverse and co workers are great especially in a fully remote environment. I recommend if handling 50 plus calls daily with different call types may not be for you."
Verizon,Customer Service Advocate,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?I enjoyed the challenge of fixing issues that a customer was dealing with. The benefits and pay were good as well.  And the pay was on point too.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not knowing if we were going to have a job since things went down hill with Verizon in 2022.  Also, Verizon did ultimately get rid of the majority of their call  center reps.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It was a rather in-office policy driven environment as I worked from home and those policies were part of the job. (Policies from the time I was going into the office daily.)What is a typical day like for you at the company?Answer call after call of customers with various issues that needed to be fixed."
Verizon,Sales Specialist,3,"Verizon is a great place to work if you can fall into the cookie cutter expectations they have for sales.You are pushed to sell in ways that the company sees fit, and if you don’t are reprimanded constantly, even if sales are exceeding expectations.Quotas are continuing to rise and harder and harder to hit, and rely greatly on luck.More and more expectations are put onto you as time progresses, with low raises yearly."
Verizon,IT Specialist,4,It was not a bad place to work. I was able learn a lot  in the time I was and enjoyed my time with the company.There were long hours though as well as weekends.
Verizon,Outside Plant Engineer,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The best part of working at the company having new experiences of working from home. Also working from office had flexible schedule. I enjoyed having less commuting time,  choosing my location, job flexibility, less stressful, continuous learning and development of job skill.Work wasn’t boring or monotonous type it was multitasking type. I gained new experience on data management,  video conference,  new technologies, new apps, new system etc. Most of the coworkers had positive attitude and professionalism.  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Managing everything on timely manner sometime was the most stressful part. Sometimes  order wasn’t processed on time due to low inventory, some miscommunication or network problem that caused lot of  unwanted stress. Working with very experienced coworkers. Not knowing the things that managers, coworkers or engineers expect me to know.  Sometimes felt less confident, unprepared and worried  attending the meetings as new employee and being asked  unexpected questions. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Everybody tried their best to make employee feel comfortable. Some coworkers were helpful but due to their busy schedule they could not give enough time.  Employee expected to learn very fast. All the resources and technical articles were on the server to read and navigate. New knowledge based articles were sent by the publisher and encouraged workers to attend the meetings for any questions or clarification. This company also introduced - more..."
Verizon,Procurement analyst,3,"Poor pay and disorganised management. Training was poor there, no sops to follow and more training should be given. Good perks but I think management is a bit of a mess. "
Verizon,Systems Engineer,1,This is a terrible place to work. They are actively working on outsourcing everybody. Your manager doesn’t care about you. There’s plenty of nepotism.
Verizon,Inside Sales,5,Verizon Wireless is a good career and with amazing benefits. The goals are achievable and the commission is nice once they start to double. I would highly recommend applying to Verizon. 
Verizon,Verizon Wireless Sales Representative,1,They give you an inconsistent schedule and make you work holidays and weekends and schedule you up to 12 days in a row with no break. They pressure you into forcing people to buy things they don’t need and get mad when you sell 4/5 things they wanted you too instead of being happy they got the 4 things they get mad they didn’t get all 5. Were just numbers to them and they don’t care how much stress they put on us. Everybody I work with hates their job.
Verizon,Customer Service Representative,3,"They pressure you to upsell at least 3 times in a call. I hated having to talk the elderly into getting a iPhone. At the time Verizon was switching everything from 4g to 5g and they used that time to upsell to retired customers to buy the new iPhone bc it’s made for 5g. These people usually lived in small towns and were fine with their flip phones and 10gs a month. Once you got them with the phone then you sell them on a plan so they can “enjoy all the features you new phone has to offer.” I hated it and eventually I couldn’t do it anymore after about a month of my sup listening in on my calls and begging me to lie to them. Training was long and tedious the company do have a lot of great workers benefits and they pay was great! They offer long maturity leave with pay, stock options, prizes and rewards. I got to know a lot of people either through training or working with coworkers across different positions within the company. It would be an awesome place to work if they didn’t force us to lie. "
Verizon,Designer,3,"Things change frequently. Management, priorities, and the vision for the future. But the plan is rarely clear nor are the details communicated. Although the direction changes, titles and compensation rarely do without applying internally. "
Verizon,Customer Service Representative,4,So i would say it was an easy job and the pay wasnt the best. I really enjoyed the people and i feel like i learned alot about sales working there. I 
Verizon,SMB Account Manager,1,What is the best part of working at the company?pay and benefits are the best part of working here What is the most stressful part about working at the company?extreme performance standards
Verizon,Central Office Equipment Installer,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great team of workers, always pushing to get the job done better than before.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Always striving to outdo the competition and short timeframes for work assignments What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It depends on your your work group, everybody is willing to helpWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy from the time you start, but always fulfilling"
Verizon,Project Manager,5,Excellent company to work for all the way around. Very respectful to employees and values their people. Tuition to get a degree discount on electronics
Verizon,Senior Customer Service Representative,4,How to handle questions and explain situations to customers. This company wanted you to predict why a customer would call back in the future. Also put rep in a repeat caller Que. which is escalations Que without extra pay or title.
Verizon,Business Sales Account Executive,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The Autonomy to do business the way that worked best for both the customer and I.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The most stressful part was losing so much time because of the systems that were down quite a bit. These systems were a vital part of the eco system utilized to close deals in a timely manner. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The environment and culture at the company was dry and strictly business. Partly due to the high demands of the large customer base. However, there was an emphasis placed on learning new ways to do business with the changing of the times.What is a typical day like for you at the company?A typical day was  8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Answering emails and preparing for meetings were first on the priority list. Once that was done, I met with clients virtually and/or in-person to discuss important business topics for 2 to 3 hours. Closing deals and setting up meetings was the name of the game. Executing the consultative sales approach was always top of discussion. Work days would also consist of an hour or so of completing  web-based trainings. I usually ended my day performing administrative duties. Prospecting by way of phone calls, emails and field visits were also mixed in throughout the week. Fun fun fun!"
Verizon,Sales Associate,5,I've learned alot here and stayed with them for 5 years. Great incentive. Great environment Great team and easy to meet quota. I earned a lot working here 
Verizon,Tech II,5,Great place to work with excellent benefits.  I really enjoyed working for Verizon and would work there again if the opportunity presents itself. I learned so much with the company.
Verizon,Field Technician,5,"The work we would be doing on a daily basis would be installing copper and fiber optic to residential and businesses. I learned a vast majority of ways to get the jobs done, either aerial, conduits, or underground. The management teams helped us out any which way we can to get the customers up and running that day. Our workplace environment was unbelievable,it was like working with brothers and sisters . The hardest part of the job was that every location is different and sometimes the dealing with harsh conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers faces and reactions when they got put into service."
Verizon,Forklift Operator,2,THIS JOB ISN'T FOR THE WEAK. you must dedicate your whole time to this job position. it is incredibly tasking and most definitely not for everyone. think twice!
Verizon,Inside Sales Representative,1,Extremely high quota lots of micromanaging would not recommend. Has gone downhill last few months. Used to be a great company to work for but that has changed.
Verizon,Sr Business Analyst,3,I think this way too much information I would like to leave it. Private but overall is good Environment is OK I would love to have some better and a stronger position
Verizon,Sales Operations Manager,3,"Creates a culture of CYA rather then production.  Many ""lifers"" were laid off multiple times and came back for the benefits.Verizon acquired my company - things were better before the acquisition - it wasn't broke but Verizon had to ""fix"" it.They ran off THE MOST AMAZING SALES PEOPLE IN SAAS because they were making too much more than the chafe.   Ridiculous. Illogical - anti-democratic.Management made decisions with half the information and irrelevant goals.I lean left of center but believe politics has ZERO place in the office, especially the sales floor,  but Verizon bends over backwards to the left and that got really really annoying.   The hardest part of the job was accepting silly or misguided changes made by people who had no sense of the situation on the ground.  Siloed is an understatement.  Most enjoyable part of the job?   Quitting - on my own terms and leaving was cathartic.  "
Verizon,FIOS Installation & Repair Technician,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Pay and benefits are good but there’s more to a job than money What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The company is in shambles regarding daily operations What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Petty work environment with staff and management is inept. The technician management relationship is transactional and punitive. What is a typical day like for you at the company?You show up for work and wonder if you will have a truck to work out of, after that you might have some work but unlikely so the manager pretends to put lines that have fallen down on you as a route and you sit at each one for an hour and a half doing nothing all day. But, you’re not allowed to idle your vehicle at this time even if it’s 100 degrees out."
Verizon,Account Sales Manager,4,Great teams and a friendly environment.  Good opportunity to move up and into different departments.  I started as a sales rep at a store and worked up to be an Account Sales Manager.  
Verizon,CSR - Customer Service Representative,5,Great place to work in. Couldn’t ask for any better opportunity. Great coworkers and leadership. The job compensates well. Great work/life balance. Best experience 
Verizon,Sales Representative,3,"Stressful position, good team leaders, high anxiety, and your commissions charge back monthly,  and each department is completely different and hard to communicate with. "
Verizon,Customer Service Representative,5,I loved working at verizon. It was a great experience. Would highly recommend anybody to work there. Best job I have ever had. Phones are fun to play with.
Verizon,Marketing Operations Manager,3,"Worked more than 50+hours each week (which was expected).  Even though they have great pay and benefits, your job really wasn't secure.  There was always the constant fear that they will make you relocate or be part of a reduction in force.  "
Verizon,Solutions Specialist,2,"The company literally goes back on everything they taught you about integrity, during your onboarding. Things we were told to never do, we were encouraged to do with EVERY customer. Including VERY shady sales tactics and outright lying to the customer. "
Verizon,Sales Representative,3,"Working as a sales representative at Verizon can be a highly rewarding experience. The company is known for its dynamic work environment, where employees are encouraged to excel and reach their full potential. Verizon provides comprehensive training programs, ensuring that sales reps are well-equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed. The company's commitment to professional development is evident through various career advancement opportunities and regular performance reviews."
Verizon,Customer Service Representative,4,"I enjoyed my time here, great managers and treated fairly, would recommend to those who are looking for a work from home job. Apply you won't regret it ."
Verizon,Customer Service Representative,3,Do not recommend. Lacks work life balance. Company is a sinking ship. Was a great company to work for pre-covid however the pay does not match all of requirements of the job. 
Verizon,Home Based Agent- Advocate,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The vacation days are phenomenal.  You get all of your vacation at the beginning of the year to use. The medical coverage is awesome and Verizon pays for your schooling no limits on degrees.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?It's so Awesome no o e leaves so you have to try different departments for promotions. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work Home balanced is the theme. If you need to take off or have an emergency you have a separate bucket of Vacation time for that.What is a typical day like for you at the company?A typical day may depend on department. My team starts our morning with light discussion and individual goals for the day.
Verizon,Purchasing Analyst,5,"The workplace culture was good.The management team was very fair, and they offered 100 percent tuition for those going back to college. Also, there is excellent 401k package and company match. They offered free training for certifications.Verizon is a great company."
Verizon,Sales Associate,4,Verizon was very transparent on what to expect from th company. I had great training and leadership. Would of enjoyed a stronger commission structure.
Verizon,Store Associate,5,Great benifits  amazing culture fun place to work nice staff people are helpful and friendly and nice to the community they have been there for so many years and I love the community 
Verizon,Technical Support,3,"Great benefits, high stress. Loved the people I worked with, but the high call volume & lack of support during escalations was stressful. Shift bids/frequent schedule changes were frustrating too."
Verizon,Tech II,5,Great place to work with excellent benefits.  I really enjoyed working for Verizon and would work there again if the opportunity presents itself. I learned so much with the company.
Verizon,Manager,5,Awesome Environment. The company really cares about their employees. Benefits are good. They also have a very supportive management system. They give you the tools you need.
Verizon,Retail Specialist,5,"A typical day at work consists of being huddled preshift, then facing customers, providing service and sales assistance with new devices, accessories, etc.I learned a lot about self management and improvement during my time here. It seems like when you're involved in your work and go the extra mile, it is recognized to the highest degree. Workplace culture is one that is very familiar for the most part. Management teams all differ in their approaches to the workplace, but all usually abide by Verizon's credo. The hardest part of the job was maintaining constantly shifting KPI performance goals, while the easiest itself was the sales aspect as if you followed Verizon's trainings, it was easy to connect with customers. My major gripe was that as an LGBTQ+ member and being a part of their internal PRISM (pride) organization, local management and HR did not live up to what the full company preached. I felt targeted and harassed after being public about myself, being told I came out incorrectly and was using work as a ""soap box to spread my idealisms"" when that couldn't have been further from the truth. Multiple LGBTQ coworkers in my area experienced the same."
Verizon,Upselling Promotional Products,5,Typical day at work is good I learnt a lot Management is good Work place culture is neutral Hardest part of the job is to explain to the customer about the bill on their account Enjoyable part is learning new things and participating in competitions
Verizon,Senior Manager,3,company has shifted and pressure has increased over the last year. Distinct disconnect from upper leadership and the frontline. Pay is not worth the lack of work life balance.
Verizon,Field Technician,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great Benefits and being part of a union. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working outside, however you get used to it. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Culture has been changed over the  years for the better,along with the work environment. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Always learning something new a d dealing with customers"
Verizon,Senior Analyst,4,ProsThere is a good work life balance.Very good PTO package. Room for growth if you’re interested in climbing up the corporate ladder. ConsSalaryMicromanagement 
Verizon,Business to Business Sales,3,"I enjoyed my time at Verizon, however, the companywide layoffs are happening pretty much at all times and nobody is safe. My team was let go and our jobs were given to those overseas. It was a shame because the benefits are great with solid work/life balance. The higher-ups are in it for themselves, which isn’t surprising, and anything they say about truly loving their team and feeling like they are family is a lie. People will say what they need to say to get ahead and leadership at Verizon is no exception. They let great employees go so that they can employ people overseas for cheap and pay leadership obscene salaries."
Verizon,Manager,3,Company provides decent pay and benefits. Not like the old days with commission though for sure. Mainly base with a touch of commission through corporate at least
Verizon,Central Office Technician,5,Great training. You learned a lot from management and employees.  Excellent pay and other benefits especially tuition assistance.  Great advancements.
Verizon,Inside Sales Representative,4,"Loved my job. The new ceo was a choice…Tuition assistance is one of if not the best in the country. Great coworkers. Fully remote, very micromanaged. 7 day call resolution changed to 3 day which could negatively affect you at no fault of your own "
Verizon,Solutions Specialist,3,"ProsCompetitive Pay and Benefits: Many employees appreciate the competitive salaries, bonuses, and comprehensive benefits packages offered by Verizon.Career Growth Opportunities: Verizon often provides training and development programs that help employees advance their careers.Work-Life Balance: Some employees find a good balance between work and personal life, especially in roles with flexible schedules.Technologically Advanced: Working for a leading tech company means being involved with cutting-edge technology and innovations.ConsHigh Pressure and Stress: Some roles, especially in sales and customer service, can be high-pressure and stressful.Workload and Hours: Depending on the position, the workload can be heavy, and long hours may be required.Management Issues: There can be mixed reviews about management, with some employees experiencing micromanagement or lack of support.Bureaucracy: As a large corporation, Verizon can have significant bureaucracy, which some employees find frustrating."
Verizon,National Accessibility Customer Service Advocate,1,"Verizon used to be an enjoyable company to work for. It’s now a toxic work environment with layoffs. Numbers driven environment, with little room to grow. "
Verizon,Sales Representative,2,Not a fun place to work at you get burnt out quick I’m one the top salesman in the country finish number #1 in the district and top 150 in the country every month and still have no promotion or pros 
Verizon,Sales Associate,3,Ok place to work. Amazing benefits but aggressive sales goals and the customers were horrible to deal with. Mangers macro managed often but promoted questionable behaviors to make sales.  
Verizon,Manager,3,Unhealthy culture with constant changes in expectations. My advice is to invest more into having a culture that will make you universally better and not better for the moment so we can look good on 1 report. Focus more on overall GP instead 
Verizon,Sales Manager,3,"The job can be very fun, and rewarding, the good days are the best days ever, but the bad days feel like you got kicked in the teeth with a steel toe boot. "
Verizon,Credit Analyst,4,The pay rate was decent. It was great to work on a team each time that there was an upgrade available Verizon allow me to have the upgrade. I think that was a great benefit.
Verizon,Assistant Sales Manager,2,"Made it harder to make money over the years, they font promote very well from within the management is worried about numbers and goals they will take advantage of customers and make business moves even if It doesn't benefit the customer "
Verizon,Technician,5,Used too be a good job. Now they’ve gone corporate and technology has changed things. Anyway that’s how I feel so if you work there take advantage of everything they offer. 
Verizon,Customer Service Representative,4,Working as a customer service representative at Verizon has been very satisfying for me. It can be stressful at times but you always have help available from co-workers as well as management. You have to be able to adapt to change as it is always constantly changing in many aspects. I do see system issues from time to time but nothing that I cannot get taken care of. Working from home has given me that time to be close to the family and that is a big plus for me.  
Verizon,Tech II,5,Great place to work with excellent benefits.  I really enjoyed working for Verizon and would work there again if the opportunity presents itself. I learned so much with the company.
Verizon,Network Engineer,4,"Good compensation, with 500K MBL for HMO, good company with good benefits such as retirement plans and has a nice working environment before it was sold to HCL Tech"
Verizon,Business Operations Specialist,4,Job was straight forward and typically busy. It could become hard to move up or around the company depending on if you were liked by certain leaders or not. 
Verizon,Sales Specialist,3,"I worked at (Verizon) for a year And six months For the most part, it is a great stable job. It has great benefits, exceptional pay and great commission structure good for those who already know how to sell. The downside is just dealing with negative customers constantly and sometimes when (Verizon) would mess up as a company on a customers bill, we would have to deal with the aftermath. The software that we use to work would often malfunction.and (Verizon) constantly trying to make employees sale pointless products to customers."
Verizon,Analyst account services,3,"The processes and systems are so broken, you wonder how they are still in business. They changed the job title on all the analyst account services and turned them into sales job with no choice. I got lucky and got offered a package everyone did not and they hate the new roll. It’s sad to say because Verizon used to be such a great company and it’s gone down so much with Hans taking over. "
Verizon,Consultant ,3,This company has pretty good benefits.  It's also very structured and is very stressful. Management is selected on unfair bias and is constantly monitoring employees. Very little flexibility. 
Verizon,Principal Network and Information Security Engineer/Consultant,5,"**Review of Verizon as an Employer:**Working at Verizon offers a dynamic and rewarding experience. A typical day involves collaboration across diverse teams, leveraging cutting-edge technology to drive innovation. The management is supportive and encourages growth, offering numerous learning opportunities and career development programs. The workplace culture is inclusive and promotes a strong sense of community. The most challenging aspect is keeping up with the fast-paced environment, but this is also the most exciting part, as it fosters continuous learning and adaptation. The most enjoyable part is the opportunity to contribute to impactful projects and initiatives."
Verizon,Sales Associate,5,fun and interesting place to work nice people and got management pay plan could be better as comission didn’t seem worthwhile and you sometimes feel more like a tech support representative 
Verizon,Customer Service Rep,2,You receive non stop phone calls from angry customers and are expected to not pause between calls. The schedules are based on seniority so you can expect to not get the best schedule when you first begin. They have great training for new hires. 
Verizon,Fort Smith,5,Great job great pay and benefits. It's a grind but it is worth it. Hardest part is learning the systems. After that it's just getting to know your customers and uncovering their needs.
Verizon,Sales Representative,4,"Very average, not too stressful. It quite easy once you learn the ins and outs of the software and programs to manage customer accounts. Overall great place to work on your social and customer support skills"
Verizon,Sales Associate,4,This was my first sales job out of college with a business degree.  The company was still GTE Wireless (before the merger with Bell Atlantic) and cell phones were still not digital yet so that was a while back but it was a good place to work.  I'm sure slinging phones is much easier these days.
Verizon,Customer Service Manager,5,"great company. Spends time on training employees for their roles. Benefits and time off is good. Worked there 10 years. Upper management can be bias at times. Overall, learned a lot from the company and the art of customer service."
Verizon,Sales Associate,5,Was great to work here for a period of time. Co workers were great and just overall felt like management gave me everything I needed to succeed from day one
Verizon,Inside Sales Representative,2,"Know what you’re getting yourself into. Very stereotypical corporate mindset. If your looking for a career there’s better options that will make you more money, but if your looking for something for a short period of time for in between careers it can work, my experience wasn’t that great and from everyone I saw most had a similar experience."
Verizon,Sales Representative,3,"Management lacks leadership, constant pressure from higher ups, high sales quota with multiple metrics that are never hit, if it wasn’t for all the micro managing and poor management, it would be a great work environment. The pay is decent, you’ll make 50-60k a year just from doing your job but getting promoted within takes a lot of favoritism and time in the company. "
Verizon,Unknown,5,A Great place to work at and I enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone who asked me about it. Wish you the best of luck in your new job with the company! 
Verizon,Solutions Specialist,3,"Great benefits and decent pay, and I overall enjoyed working with my coworkers, but some of the expectations were unrealistic and could be mentally draining. "
Verizon,Verizon Sales Representative,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?The team I ended up with happened to be the best part about this company.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The company continuously raises the quota expectations without any regard for actual foot traffic, additionally this company boasts about being able to talk to upper management about problems and working with the team to fix them but it’s just a front. They have rarely listened to the representatives, and when they do they tend to make the problem worse than when it startedWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?The environment is very stressful and the culture is fakeWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Wait for someone to walk through the door, get hounded by the managers or threaten that if you do not meet quota you will be fired. Micromanaged, and pushed to oversell things to customers, when they do not need it"
Verizon,Customer Service Representative,4,High Call volume but friendly. My only issue working here many years ago is posting out to a new title was hard because it was based on favorites.  No matter how well I did on my tests and performances I knew I had to make friends with others in other to post out.  
Verizon,Customer Service Representative,5,Have fun be yourself it is very fun cool place to be and management is extremely awsome. I was able to take a well needed vacation with all my family members.
JPMorganChase,Private Client Advisor,3,"I’ve worked in a retail branch setting as a Private Client Advisor for nearly 7 long years. The culture is really tough as a woman. I’ve heard great things about the other lines of business but my personal experience at the retail branch level has been brutal. I’ve worked with 3 other women in my specific office and all have quit and/or are about to quit. My worst experiences have included: being physically blocked from leaving my office when I explained that I needed to go to the break room to grab a drink of water before my next client meeting, being accused of having a “tone” when I answered a question, and being told by a recently divorced prospective client that I looked like a “19 year old cheerleader.” I’ve also specifically been asked about my “childcare situation.” I’m sorry to say that this is just not a nice place to work. "
JPMorganChase,Associate,4,"Interesting if you're focused on your goals and know what you are striving for, big organization, overall makes an effort to build a great culture at the macro level but is team dependent"
JPMorganChase,Fraud Claims Manager,4,"Overall, great experience working there. The pay in comparisons to the work load, is why I left. Work environment was okay, the Cafe on campus was awesome. "
JPMorganChase,Relationship Banker,5,"Chase was a great company to work for. The regional manager and by proxy the branch manager micromanaged to a number not to success. Was out preforming 95% of the market, but told i was not doing enough because I wasn’t dialing the phone enough. "
JPMorganChase,Associate Banker,4,Being a teller was easy. It is an adaptable position but it is also very demanding in the customer service department. Being customer facing for 7hours a day can be draining but the coworkers & some customers make it worth it.
JPMorganChase,Associate,5,offers access to museums and good working hours. Some group is doing overtime but overall work life balance is pretty well compared to other investment bank.
JPMorganChase,Associate Banker,4,It’s a good job if you have kids because of the hours and holidays off but not good financially because they don’t hire full time only 30 hours or less 
JPMorganChase,Business Relationship Manager ,4,Chase is best in class when it come to banking products and services. Being a great place for clients to bank makes it easier to be an employee and have confidence in our solutions and advice to help clients. Benefits and variable comp plans are good.
JPMorganChase,Senior Associate,3,How well you do is dependent on how your manager perceives your contributions. It fluctuates constantly so the place can keep you on edge for quite some time. Not for the faint of heart.
JPMorganChase,Intern,4,Interview process and everyone I’ve talked to so far have been amazing. They are very happy to answer questions and help you explore the path that is right for you
JPMorganChase,Branch Operations Manager,4,Chase offers the best of the best.  You have to love what you do everyday and want to be challenged everyday to survive in any career.  Chase and its customers provides the challenge 100% everyday.  Respect your job and the customers and management won’t micromanage.   Success comes within no matter the obstacles.

JPMorganChase,Business Solutions Banker,4,JPMorgan as a whole is a great place to work.  Very career path oriented and mostly want to find the right path for their employees.  It comes to how willing the individual is to own their path and do what it takes to network and meet people.
JPMorganChase,Operations Director ,4,"Challenging work, decent pay, good mobility options. Left due to limited upward mobility at senior end, but otherwise great company to work for. Pension was a little stingy."

JPMorganChase,Financial Analyst,3,"My team is fantastic but not much room for advancement in your career until people leave or you brown nose upper management. Compensation is fair but usually, the raises do not improve much. after sometime. Again this is all based on location. But having this big of a name on your resume is great."
JPMorganChase,Investment Analyst,5,"JPMorgan offers dynamic career growth, innovative projects, and a collaborative culture, providing excellent opportunities in finance and technology for diverse talent."
JPMorganChase,Project Manager,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits package is the best part of working at this global bank. Health, vision, dental, 401k. Life insurance and employee discounts. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Competing priorities. Attitude is make time to get it done or you don't care about the firm.Management changes their mind every month and if you don't have a relationship with the person in charge of your team you never get compensation increases that even stay at the percentage of inflation. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Has become an environment of management  by bullying. When you raise concerns you are told you need to change your thought process. What is a typical day like for you at the company?So many meetings you have 3 hours a day to actually do your work! And when you try to decline a meeting your manager tells you to attend for them."
JPMorganChase,Private Client Advisor,3,"I’ve worked in a retail branch setting as a Private Client Advisor for nearly 7 long years. The culture is really tough as a woman.

JPMorganChase,Customer Service Representative,4,"I was satisfied with my salary but the work load is too much. everyday I'd get 100+ calls and most of them were irate customers. It costed me blood, sweat and tears there."
JPMorganChase,Relationship Banker,1,Pros to working for Chase:- training/ licensing -for the most part the branch team is really nice and you end up really liking each other -time off and holidays paid -clothing allowance minimal but it’s there. Cons - cattiness sharkiness -incompetence in management most have been with the company for a long time and have 0 accountability for actions and treatment. - you have to make a lot of calls no goal but their is a lot of micromanaging and passive aggressive comments made from the Manager to the Market Director. Depending of that’s a deal breaker for you or not it gets very old very fast. -  A lot of role playing for everything it doesn’t come off as genuine it’s very forced onto employees. - The stealing of clients is insane! All branches are close to each other so essentially you help a client out they go down the road and theirs a sharply banker that will steal your client and their manager will back them up. - That in itself gets old fast. - The comparison of employees constantly (definitely downgrading the culture)
JPMorganChase,Trade Life Cycle Associate,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Absolutely nothing. Horrible place to work. Management is the worst I have ever worked with, and I have been in this industry over 24 years. Never dealt with such an unprofessional group of tyrants. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Constant berating and no guidance or clear explanation of there expectations. Sadly this is a result of having people in charge that don't know there own line of work. Nepotism is the number one issue at JPMWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?JPM lacks teamwork. You are taught to play the blame game and no one will address the issues.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Defensive, guard up and watch your back"
JPMorganChase,"Vice President, Product Manager",4,"I love working here, the culture is great and the people are so smart and kind. I love that you can move internally pretty easily too. My negative feedback is that the compensation is under market value vs other companies and they know this and don't seem to care to rectify it because they justify it due to the ""JPMC"" name. "
JPMorganChase,Customer Service Representative,3,a great place to work with supportive teams and many opportunities for growth. good work-life balance and positive company culture focused on innovation.

JPMorganChase,Branch Operations Lead,5,Good benefits and work life balance. Hard to move from retail banking to corporate. Good overall culture and company. Annual raises and good benefits including 401k match and paid time off. 
JPMorganChase,Associate Banker/Teller,4,The branch that I worked in was very high stress. My direct manager tended to micromanage me. There were times when we did not have enough cash on hand to service or customers. 
JPMorganChase,Associate,3,The company will over work you and underpay you. Once the they’re done with you they will let you go without even thinking twice. You could get a good manager or a bad one
JPMorganChase,Program Manager/Project Manager,3,Firm is going through changes and has all but stagnated the ability to grow and develop. Hopefully when all the changes settle things will pick up again
JPMorganChase,Senior Specialist,4,"Boring job function, same calls over and over. But good company benefits, guaranteed 40 hours a week. Not a lot of opportunity for advancement.  Management is hit or miss. You can get someone who cares and helps you develop professionally. Or you’ll get someone who is just worried about numbers."
JPMorganChase,Account Specialist,5,JPMC Cebu is beyond the best. hybrid setup and the management is also okay and supportive of career growth. they also see to it that all employees are supported.
JPMorganChase,Associate,4,"Great allowance and benefits, but management makes you doubt yourself ehich can be toxic.Gives appreciation rewards, but efforts are not reflected in performance reviewVisible favoritism"

They don't know how to provide clear strategic vision and support mobility.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?For the most part, most people are hard workers and willing to share information to bring you up to speed.  However, with the influx of new leadership and talent, there has been a cultural shift in the wrong direction.  Some of these people have no desire to help you develop and succeed in the workplace.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Lots of meetings, mixed with tactical work, mentorship, relationship building and deliverable submissions."
JPMorganChase,Business Analyst,4,"The company offers a good work life balance, with generous leave, and flexible working hours. People are collaborative and supportive. However, the  compensation is below the market rate, and promotion to VP and higher positions can require a long time, often 6-8 years."
JPMorganChase,Private Client Banker,4,"Great benefits, like retirement plan and stock purchase options.  Decent work and life balance and overall nice work environment. Opportunity for growths. "
JPMorganChase,Relationship Banker,3,Busy but you meet people from all walks of life. Good experience. Have to know how to deal with different attitudes though. Having a good Branch Manager is important too
JPMorganChase,Customer Service Representative,3,Good place to work although it was stressful due to metrics. Phone work can be very exhausting. Over all it had good benefits and several schedules tp choose from. 
JPMorganChase,Data Entry Clerk,1,"management is Bad. If you know someone then you are good for everyone otherwise nothing you can do for them even if you worked so hard. I joined the team and suddenly I got an issue about taking care of my baby I genially asked them if they could give me part time for 3-4 days. And they are like no we don't approve and if you can do you can resign. I need a job at that time I request everyone to please let me come for 3-4 hours, I don't want to call off. Because the Manager said if you called off for 3 days anyway I would fire you. So with a heavy heart, I resign. Very Bad Experience. So many Recesses People. "

"
JPMorganChase,Associate Banker,5,Very good place to work if you are starting off your career in the banking industry.  The staff was pleasant and the manager was fair and very nice. Recommend. 
JPMorganChase,Private Client Advisor,3,The retail platform is needing some serious insight from competitors -- management fees are much higher than competition. The retail platform is more catered to bank clients than those seeking true wealth management. A lot of improvement needed to grow the platform and remain even remotely competitive to other non-bank channel firms.
JPMorganChase,Manager,1,"Working as a manager at JCPenney was a frustrating and unpleasant experience. The store was constantly understaffed, which led to long hours and overwhelming workloads with little support from upper management. Communication was poor, making it difficult to complete tasks efficiently. One of the worst aspects was dealing with the assistant manager, whose hygiene was repulsive and distracting. The smell was unbearable at times, making it difficult to focus, and despite bringing up the issue, nothing was done to address it. The combination of poor management, lack of staffing, and the uncomfortable working conditions made my time at JCPenney miserable."
JPMorganChase,Client Service Analyst,3,Got laid off three different times but the managers were all great people. Chase tried to make it enjoyable but shipping most jobs overseas. Gave 401k bonuses every year.
JPMorganChase,Fraud Specialist I,3,"The company has many great perks! However, their attendance policies leave people who have medical issues in a very bad position. They offer excellent education benefits but the  management is clueless as to how to help you progress for what you’re getting educated on. Upper management doesn’t talk to anyone lower than Team Lead status. You definitely know you’re on the low end of importance because unless you’re in trouble or going out of your way to get recognition- you never see the any of the VPs or floor directors interacting with the “little people”. "
JPMorganChase,Senior Executive Assistant,4,"The brand and company are great. However, most people stay on 2 years so they will treat you like a robot. They pretend to care about people but clearly only interested in bottom line like many banks. They will treat you like a robot.  Managers feel like you're a subordinate. No partnership. Don't ask questions or expect to come with new ideas."
JPMorganChase,Travel Agent,3,Working remote and its had its ups and downs do to constant policy changes however good pay and benefits. Annual raises and slight micromanagement. Easy to move up within the company
JPMorganChase,Intern,5,"The internship was a great experience. I learned a lot and they invest a lot of time into their interns. Overall, I really enjoyed the summer internship. "
JPMorganChase,Teller,3,Great job but they kept increasing my responsibilities without increasing my pay. I was doing the same things as supervisors but for way less. Great benefits though 
JPMorganChase,Associate,4,"My team is very supportive and nice but the job gets very repetitive and manager decisions largely impact the quality of work you do, could be better  "
JPMorganChase,Vice President,5,"Very good company. All training, transport ,leaves provided. Too much to learn and they are way ahead in technologies as compared to other companies. "
JPMorganChase,Kitchen Assistant,4,Management every good help people like me they given a change to work  thank you the. I can say.  The most enjoyable part of the job.  The most especially  most special work with college.

JPMorganChase,Private Client Banker,3,"Highly sales driven. Heavy focus on metrics if you work in a branch (outbound calls, number of credit cards sold, hard push on selling convenience services. Base pay is extremely low with the promise that you can earn incentive pay which is ""unlimited."" Not totally true as there are caps/limits. Sometimes very hard to get paid. Felt like I had to fight for every dollar. Extreme micromanagement (at least in my case.) Final straw was a reduction in incentive bay during a time of record profits, record earnings, all-time high for the stock price, etc."
JPMorganChase,Lead Investment Banking ,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?There were no best part at jpmorgan as there is discrimination What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with racism and discrimination What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Not friendly at all, it was a bad experience working for jpmorgan bank What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful,  lots of work without progress or any promotions"
JPMorganChase,Associate Banker,4,Mixed feelings about the company in general but will say that their pay is quite competitive and their technology is leaps and bounds above the industry standard.
JPMorganChase,Customer Service Specialist,3," advised information to releasing account holds, learned a lot of patience and handled customers at their lowest, vulnerable moment, management tried to help but they were useless, you work with a bunch of liberals, the hardest part of the job is keeping handling time to a minimum, unable to exert quality customer service,   the most enjoyable is having nationwide bank holidays off "
JPMorganChase,Associate Banker-ME,4,"I enjoy my time here at Chase, it has amazing benefits, great hours, good pay compare to many other places. Yes every position that you might think , Chase most likely has it but it's extremely hard to move up or even applying to other departments, you would think because it's internal application they would at least see you but they don't. Also, if you have a good manager you would enjoy your time here, like every job."
JPMorganChase,Vice President,1,"Nothing really matters to the senior management! Salary is average, only creamy layer grow here! 1% is normal salary increment per year! Wasted!Dont wait here too long, which i did, unfortunately. Wasted my 10 precious years working for a company which kind of hired a pilot to fly a plane and made him drive uber with tire repair shop guy as the boss!Thats what the culture is, annual salary hike when business did 400% profit was 1.5%, cos company was cautious! Cost of living spiked up by 30%, guess what, even the cafetaria inside the campus went costly but hey.. we are being cautious about the economy!Over all - dont waste time here if you are not recognized, given opportunity to prove or someone else is given preferential treatment!"

JPMorganChase,Account Specialist,1,"The calls are back to back NON stop even on holidays RETAIL is the only department “segment” that is open 24/7 the customers are rude and entitled, Chase makes it hard for you to go on leave, especially medical. They speak about mental health but when asked how can they help they say “this is a business” and we have policies in place, they also don’t accommodate any medical needs either. "
JPMorganChase,Fraud Specialist II,2,Toxic work environment per usual at big corps. If you do not fit in or in a click just like high school you will never move up no matter how good you are. Favoritism is how it works here. They do not pay enough for someone to live. Do better.

JPMorganChase,Credit Analyst,5,"Great culture, great staffing, great benefits and great incentives to move up and progress your career further within financial services. Would recommend. "
JPMorganChase,Software Engineer,3,"Great for coasting. Bad if you want to challenge or improve yourself. You'll get bogged down with red tape if you try to stick your head above the trenches and your teammates will drag you down. Seems to hire from 1 ethnic background only, good luck if you're not it. You have to leave then come back to get a promotion and a raise. "

I believe my job thought me many skills, including accounting, customer service quality, sales, and how to get along with each coworker. Management I was thought to assist the new branch manager. Workplace was a mix of all sorts of different folks that spoke another language. The culture at J.P. Morgan Chase is we do need to look at each customer as they ""have written in their forehead I need help. ""The hardest part of the job was all the many different accounts we were told to sell. The most enjoyable part of my job was the recognition from management and customers when doing an outstanding job."
JPMorganChase,Associate Banker/Teller,5,What is the best part of working at the company?I am not only excepted by so many I am able to experience and learn from different genres of people.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Customer judgement is my biggest concern.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Diversity at its best!  It's very excepting and teachable environment. Someone is always ready to help.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Pretty busy at my branch but we run pretty smoothly.
JPMorganChase,Lockbox Clerk,1,The job was super easy. We usually do the same tasks everyday. Have to sign a NDA. I started to hate it because of the treatment that I was receiving. The managers are always criticizing you. They are quick to fire. High turnover.
JPMorganChase,Personal Banker,4,"The benefits really carry the pros of this job vs the cons. The pay is typical of banking, you really have to be positioned in a high traffic/high income branch to make decent commission. Having vacations off/bank holidays off and paid is very nice. They do treat their employees with respect here. Good pension and matched 401k. Here comes the cons, have to sit down about 8 hours a day. Some days will be dull and filled with calling clients to fulfill your quoted of stuff to do. Can sometimes boil down to a customer service job."
JPMorganChase,Relationship Banker,5,Probably the best company I have ever worked for. They give you great opportunities and ways to grow within the company. Very sales focused however and stressful at times but worth the work you put in
JPMorganChase,Asst. Vice President,4,"The company overall is a good one to work for. Great benefits, updated buildings and hybrid schedule. Since it's so big you can fall in between the cracks if you don't have a good Program you are working for"
JPMorganChase,Fraud Specialist,3,"Pay is good and great benefits, advancing is very competitive,  if you’re good at interviewing and being on time with your schedule you may advance quickly "
JPMorganChase,Relationship Banker,5,"You learn a lot fast, it can be demanding at times but the risk is worth the reward. However you have to be open to learning the chase ways because they do their best to equip you to succeed. "
JPMorganChase,Travel Specialist,4,"The job is nice, the pay is pretty good. I have nothing bad to say, if youre looking for a job please apply. Youll feel like home there and management is awesome "
JPMorganChase,Private Client Advisor,3,"I’ve worked in a retail branch setting as a Private Client Advisor for nearly 7 long years. The culture is really tough as a woman. I’ve heard great things about the other lines of business but my personal experience at the retail branch level has been brutal. I’ve worked with 3 other women in my specific office and all have quit and/or are about to quit. My worst experiences have included: being physically blocked from leaving my office when I explained that I needed to go to the break room to grab a drink of water before my next client meeting, being accused of having a “tone” when I answered a question, and being told by a recently divorced prospective client that I looked like a “19 year old cheerleader.” I’ve also specifically been asked about my “childcare situation.” I’m sorry to say that this is just not a nice place to work. "
JPMorganChase,Fraud Specialist,3,"Benefits are good. Time off is great. There’s such, vacation, personal, and volunteer. The department is high stress. Not because it’s fraud but they care so much about meeting average handle time while expecting you to do an amazing job, and save them money, and prevent fraud.  Management doesn’t always listen to concerns. They give you crumbs but it doesn’t seem like all information is shared, then you get a talking to when you mess up. I’m seeing other employment. Pay is ok for call center work. No bonuses. "
JPMorganChase,Product Manager,4,"The company overall is a good one to work for. Great benefits, updated buildings and hybrid schedule. Since it's so big you can fall in between the cracks if you don't have a good Program you are working for. Make sure you have a good manager because if you don't your career will not grow. "
JPMorganChase,Associate Banker,5,"I worked for Chase for over 8yrs, it is a very good financial institution to work for. The training is always up to date and very relevant. Management was always supportive and willing to listen. Co-workers were the best. Benefits were amazing. I have no serious complaints, I continued to work thru the pandemic, chase takes care of employees. Highly recommend!"
JPMorganChase,Executive Director,4,"good orso match, lots of resources  for self development, high-energy environment, demanding hours if working with global colleagues, good amount of vacation days"
JPMorganChase,Lockbox Specialist,3,The training is minimal for the amount of information and how important it is to be kept secure. The hours are 24 hours . Depending on the department you will have plenty of hours or none. Everyone works for a different temp agency so some rules go for some and not others . They don’t like you to take time off unless their numbers are down
JPMorganChase,Operations Automation Senior Associate,5,Been with the firm for 10 years. PTO and pay is great. Work culture is excellent and so is the work-life-balance. Great company to grow your career in.
JPMorganChase,Product,3,Good workplace and good typical / standard benefits with respect to Singapore benchmarks. Can join to learn and grow your career as loads of folks stay over 10+ years
JPMorganChase,Software Engineer II,3,"I was very suprised at how non diverse the tech area is. The work is okay but it’s very annoying trying to be productive dealing with not only work politics, but also culture / caste politics as a outsider.  A lot of the leaders that are hired do not care about workers. The only care about the work being done. JP Morgan claims to care about diversity but mysteriously hires one group of people. Go to building F, you’ll see what I’m talking about. "
JPMorganChase,Relationship Banker II,4,"Great benefits. Market (meaning region or district) you work in (big vs. small) will determine room for growth in your career. There are ups and downs in every job, especially in customer facing environments. "
JPMorganChase,Senior Product Associate,4,"It provides outstanding benefits as far as PTO, medical insurance, perks, etc. There was a good work environment, people are nice, open to listen and collaborative. You can find opportunities for career development, lots of options to study and develop your skills and take the path you want within the company.  "
JPMorganChase,Infrastructure Engineer,5,"They know how to take care of their employees here.  Benefits are great and annual bonuses for tech workers help with retention.  It is a massive organization so some things move a bit slowly, but all in all it is a great environment.  Would recommend to anyone."
JPMorganChase,Collections Specialist,3,The work environment was really bad and not a sense of job security in the work place . The management needs a lot of work sometimes they don’t know what there doing 
JPMorganChase,Sourcing Manager,5,"Overall a great workplace. Fairly strong leadership amongst all divisions. minimal annual raises, old fashioned way of determining promotion. Good benefits."
JPMorganChase,Private Client Banker,4,"The training to become a banker is great. They pay for you to become a licensed banker and provide you with the tools to obtain your Series 6, Series 63, and Life Insurance. The base pay is low, my base was $35K with unlimited bonus potential. Still, the metrics were changed every year that made it more difficult to make more money."
JPMorganChase,Associate Banker-ME,5,"My first foray into banking, Chase made it very easy to transition into. After about little over a year in this position, I don’t have any regrets. Love it!"
JPMorganChase,Vice President,4,Be prepared to play the corporate game and speak your mind sensibly. Otherwise wonderful place to be and 3 days a week tending to 5 days now that the pandemic is over
JPMorganChase,Business Relationship Manager,5,"Good place to work with great benefits, culture and autonomy.Improving the relationship between different line of businesses and focused on client experience."
JPMorganChase,Banker,3,"very family oriented, my team is fun to work with, but at times clients can give you a very hard time with simple issues, management does not help with growth"
JPMorganChase,Senior AML Investigator,1,"Management is a joke. They do not care about your health or well-being, only producing numbers. There is no leadership, you basically have to fend for yourself and ask other associates around you because management either doesn't know or doesn't care to help. Most managers cannot complete the job itself, ie (writing SARS etc), but they expect you to know everything. Training is a joke and horribly lead. Upper management is disrespectful and 100% goes off favoritism. I worked at JPMC for 9 years and towards the last 2 years wished I could get away, everyday. It has become horrible at JPMC, unworkable, unmanageable, upper management is horrendous and the company just literally does not care about their employees. Raises are also horrible, bare minimum when you give your entire years life to the business. "
JPMorganChase,Corporate Banking Analyst,5,"Working at JPM straight out of underground has been incredibly important for my professional career. There is a strong pressure to perform the best given JPM’s position in the financial services industry, but a huge emphasis is placed on training and collaboration. "
General Motors,Systems Engineer,3,At first I had a cool team & cool manager. Flexible. Work from home. Team oriented. Collaboration. Fulfilling work. But then upper management forced a re-org. And I got a new manager and director. They were obsessed with tickets and velocity. Mass layoffs followed suit.

General Motors,"Fort Wayne, IN",1,"I started GM to work my way into full-time employment.

General Motors,Laborer/Operator,5,"You get a good mix of busy days, slow days, learning new things, meeting new faces, and earning a good living every day. The Union has supported me in times of need, and I’ve lost 60 lbs. within my time working here due to the labor, so be ready for a workout."
General Motors,Operador de Sistemas,4,"The pleasant part is that they are great people to work, educated people who help. The difficult part is the salary that one hour comes good, it's right and another time comes with discounts to the back of nothing and we try to solve and it ispassed from hand to hand and no one solves"
General Motors,Material Handling Supervisor,4,"What is the best thing to work in the company? Benefits and the work environment What is the most stressful of working in the company?

General Motors,Design Leader,1,We were told we could move anywhere in the US and be remote.  We were told if we lived more than 100 miles from work we could stay remote.  After 4.5 Yeats they are revoking remote status.  They are saying we have 30 days to be back in the office.  So I'm supposed to move half across the country in 30 days to keeps my job because they changed their mind.  The really sad part is this is being pushed by HR.  HR has  new VP they hired from the tech industry.  She works remote from Montana.This company has really gone downhill the last 2 years.  Many good workers and managers took the early retirement.   The new managers don't have a clue.  Many of them are in charge of areas they know nothing about.  If I owned stock in this mismanaged dinosaur I would be selling.
General Motors,Senior Software Engineer,4,"My personal experience working in GM is most definitely positive. Of course being lucky with being on a good team with a good manager plays a big role here, but for what I see, people are nice, salary and benefits are at least average, with consistent annual raises and bonuses, good benefits, etc. The work-life balance is good, and the flexible hybrid work is also not to be taken for granted these days. If to mention any cons, that would be your regular big company package: Frequent reorgs, direction changes, bureaucracy, processes, and so on - But that's no worse than any company on this scale. Also, GM is not a place for those who are looking for cutting edge innovation in software - The software development practices and the technology stack is pretty outdated, but at least the company is aware of that and honestly tries to change that - But that's going to be a long process."
General Motors,Industrial Electrician,1,What is the best part of working at the company?The only good part is the pay What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Shifts. Management style. Forced to work on weekends What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Absolutely horrible - management is the worst of the worst.

And I got a new manager and director. They were obsessed with tickets and velocity. Mass layoffs followed suit.
General Motors,Senior Electrical Architect,5,The management culture is great if you like hands off approach. I found them unhelpful with career advancement.The work culture is great.I wouldn't recommend as a long-term workplace; they lay off workers every 8 to 10 years.The workload is reasonable with little stress.Promotions are hard to come by and I suspect the candidate was already selected (I interviewed for a position in area I worked with 20+ years experience and was the most senior/experienced person by a mile)
General Motors,Maintenance Electrical Supervisor,1,Chaos. No one has a clue. Management plays blame game every shift Micromanaged 100% No break When I was having a low blood sugar issue. I explained to my boss he said sounds like a personal problem.

You have a lot of opportunity to move around in the company and try on different hats, and if you are good at advocating for yourself, you will go far. That being said, like many companies in the auto industry, job stability is not the greatest. It felt like layoffs were always looming, coming every 2-3 years. As a young professional, I did not mind the uncertainty, but if you plan on long term, expect drama and career changes. "
General Motors,Team Leader,2,"Union family is great, always have each other's backs.Management change their mind almost everyday. Have no problem passing blame.Very repetitive work"
General Motors,Senior Product Manager – Software and Services,4,Everyday was busy with multiple fires to be put out.  I learned to prioritize the most urgent tasks first for each day and reshuffle the remaining tasks at hand.  The workplace culture was one of hierarchy.  All status details must go through upper management for review.  The hardest part of the job was not having work/life balance.  The most enjoyable part of the job was solving complex software problems for launching world class vehicles
General Motors,Software Engineer,2,"Work place has become incredibly toxic as the SLT becomes more hostile to their employees.

General Motors,District Service Manager,1,"This company will exploit you and make you false promises any chance they get. The first handful of times you get burned, you think it's a one off thing, but then it keeps happening repeatedly. Favoritism comes into play with internal promotions, so unqualified idiots are holding leadership roles. They know nothing because anyone worth their salt in the company took one of the recent VSPs, so majority of your ""veteran"" employees have only been around only a few years."
General Motors,Analista de Costos,5,"It has a very good work environment and life balance, in addition to very good benefits far superior to the law and also very competitive salaries"
General Motors,Social Responsibility Analyst,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Leaving at the end of the day.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Being underutilized and not knowing what is expected of you.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Too many days working in the office when you could do your work from home.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I left the  company.

Your employees a lot of classism Many obstacles to go up are not even. How is the environment and culture ofwork in the company? The production is above all things, how is a typical day for you in the company? It is a bit demanding for the schedules"
General Motors,Accounting Coordinator,5,Nothing but fond memories and great opportunities if you apply yourself.   They do care for their workforce. 90% of  management were superb.  No regrets at all.
General Motors,Test Engineer,4,"GM provided a lot of growing opportunities. there is still a good ole boys club that you have to be aware of. as long as you stay on their good side, you will be alright. "
General Motors,Software Engineer,1,Company going down the drain and nothing will stop the constant layoffs for no reason. Clueless on how to fix problems rather make headlines to prop stock so that they can trade and make profit before the ultimate demise and dismissal. 
General Motors,Operador de Produção,1,"What is the best part of working in the company? Only the restaurant and PPR that are worth this company which is the most stressful part of the work in the company?robot, does not have the least respect for the human being. How are the environment and the culture of work in the company? Extremely harmful to the physical and mental health of the employee"
General Motors,Controls Engineer,3,Pay and benefits are elite for the automotive industry. Managers do not have a clue. Company is willing to pay new employees more  than senior employees with tons of experience. The experience is a hit or miss depending on your teams placement.
General Motors,Systems Engineer,3,At first I had a cool team & cool manager. Flexible. Work from home. Team oriented. Collaboration. Fulfilling work. But then upper management forced a re-org. And I got a new manager and director. They were obsessed with tickets and velocity. Mass layoffs followed suit.
General Motors,Software Engineer,4,The team was great and professional and everyone in the team was cooperative and helpful. The bad thing is that it was only 4 month and it is not easy to say anything much.

General Motors,CX Manager,3,"Pay is decent Benefits are good Management is a joke, incompetent middle managers, micromanagement accross the org. Some good managers exist but hard to find "
General Motors,Embedded Software Engineer,4,"The pay and benefits are great especially for this area. Your milage may vary depending on the group you're in, but I found the work-life balance to be good and they are true to being hybrid for now. The work is often quite boring and is structured in a way that the systems team and architects basically tell you exactly what to do in software so it is not challenging or much room for growth as a SWE. Upper management has been tumultuous for the past few years and has done a real bad job at communicating with the employees and setting company direction with thinks like virtualization and EVs. Prone to cycles of layoffs. Also there aren't any free unnamed perks like free food or coffee in the office, paid team outings, etc. "

Fulfilling these quotas implemented by the corporation your first year and also being able to achieve higher amounts 10 years later.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment at GM is based on production numbers and being able to produce consistently. You will be trained well. Safety is also a very important part of their manufacturing process.The work culture is full of pride in their excellence they have shown for over 100 years in some of their first divisions that over the years have came together and now has became the giant auto company,  GM.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Trying to find small ways to do your job a little more efficiently and always safely. Seeing newly made friends. Also longtime friendships you have made with workers Trying to achieve similar goals as your own."
General Motors,Software Engineer,3,Projects change and cancelled all the time. Constant layoffs creating tension. Non technical voices are praised for just using buzzwords rather than actual improvements.
General Motors,Production Worker,4,Good pay and benefits but hard and  long hours.  Supervisors and management can be pain to deal with at times. Work-life balance is not the best and work puts a strain on your health.
General Motors,Team Member,1,"You are treated as a machine, 10 minutes breaks which you spend 2 minutes to get out and 2 minutes get back. Management does not care about you, they just care about to keep the line running.  No rotation and job is repetitive, so you get injured with the time. You stand all the time during the 8 hours shift. "

General Motors,Production Associate,1,Absolutely the worst environment I've ever been in. Management and the union legitimately sabotage good people. I hope general motors closes permanently so no one has to experience what I did. Horrible company with no standards regarding build quality.

General Motors,Sr. Software Development Manager,2,"GM provides a good compensation program. Many company holidays and paid vacation days annually. Work pressure is mild if you take it easy. But if you would like to do something meaningful, and valuable for someone, GM is not a place for you. GM IT does not encourage innovation, and the executive management does not listen to your voice, even if they promise they will. Many IT management do not have a technical background. If you are a rigorous engineer, you will feel very uncomfortable. Some senior management does not respect your hard work."
General Motors,Software Developer,2,"GM goes through contract AND salary workers like they're nothing. You don't matter to these big companies and they don't care if you know it. They know the job market is hard right now, which is how they can get away with it. My advice? if you're deciding between GM and another job, and want a longterm career there, go with the other job. They'll eventually replace you at GM."
General Motors,Systems Engineer,3,At first I had a cool team & cool manager. Flexible. Work from home. Team oriented. Collaboration. Fulfilling work. But then upper management forced a re-org.

General Motors,Production Supervisor,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?I really enjoyed working at GM. The training I received was second to none. The training was required yearly. I also worked at 2 different locations. I was amazed how the training I received at one plant carried over to my second location. I will always be grateful for my experiences at GM!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The age gap at each plant! At one plant it was easy to train employees, but at second plant it was a much older group.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?One of integrity, simply put (say what you do and do what you say)!

General Motors,Operator,1,"A typical day could be boring or exhausting, it depends on how well the lines run.  A temporary worker had no rights even though you are told in orientation that you are equal. I learned the hard way that I was nothing but manpower, and could easily be replaced. Managers treated you like slaves and talk to you like you’re a child. If you are a threat to their job they will transpire together and black ball you. They steal ideas and get compensated for them. Employees are usually involved in extra relationships with multiple people in the workplace. Alcohol and drugs are used during work hours and in parking lots. The hardest part was the anticipation of getting hired, Busting your butt to get recognition for your service only to be denied access and terminated like your contribution was nothing to them. Developing copper tunnel insomnia and sore feet with no compensation.  Overall in my opinion ,The only positive was the weekly pay."

Centene,RN Care Manager II,4,What is the best part of working at the company?Good group of employees in our unit.  Good benefits.  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Stressful in that procedures to follow kept changing frequently and many employees had different ideas on how to follow procedures and that created even more confusion. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Usual corporate type of environment in that there are many layers of people and sometimes did not feel as personal. Culture was promoting diversity and learning.  Enjoyed that part. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Came in at the same time daily and each day was unique due to our clients that we served.  Always a hurdle to get through in order to provide excellent service to the clients.   Sometimes too many layers of employees in order to obtain correct information.
Centene,Customer Care Representative (CCR),5,I am a care giver and I have a huge heart.  Centene gives me the opportunity to care for others in their time of need.  I enjoy working for a company that values its people and their efforts.  While conflict is not pleasant I accept the challenge and will do my best for our patients to get the resolution they need.  I love the diverse culture of my coworkers and the people we serve.  Centene gives me the tools to help people all around the world.  Sometimes the hard part is the fast pace when you have to balance quality and quantity.  Fortunate to have a team that can help
Centene,Senior Care Manager,3,Lots of management changes made it difficult to make any progress. Insane annual goals that require a spreadsheet to keep track of. Middle managers have very little power to change workflows. 
Centene,Machine Learning Engineer Intern,4,"The internship was a good experience, but by the end I felt like I didn’t get a whole lot out of it. The tasks I was performing felt more like busy work than anything. "

Centene,Operations Supervisor,3,"Productive and great learning and career experience. Was able to gain experience from health insurance. Met new people, unfortunately they lost a lot of Medicare contracts"
Centene,Care Coordinator,2,"You essentially work in a call center which is not what I fully expected when taking the role. Constant changes in state mandates impact employees trying explain and refer for services. Very short staffed in my department and management does little to support. It's pretty disappointing. Pay is not that great, but the job also doesn't require higher education. Real disconnect with upper management. Constantly being asked to take on extra work or do something silly to appease supervisor. "
Centene,Data Analyst,5,Flexible understanding bosses and I’m not micromanaged! I am able to use the skills I trained hard to get and make a difference while doing so! The laptop could be better if I had A gripe
Centene,Care Navigator,5,good place to work benefits are ok management can be better. room to grow. great team player work life balance. no overtime high call volume.  time paid off
Centene,Customer Service Representative,3,"Great company to work for, you have the opportunity to move up and around within the company, the benefits are also great... if you have a knack for helping people, this is the place for you... it's quite fulfilling in that sense. However; your experience at this company is solely based on the Supervisor/Managment you are assigned. From what I've heard some supervisors are good, in the sense of being available to you for assistance with whatever you need. But my experience as well as the experiences of others was the total opposite... quite a few supervisors are non-responsive. I had a colleague who didn't meet or heat from her Sup until after a month or so starting the job. It's hard to get in touch with them, simple things such as timesheet corrections or even crisis calls  are a hassle to get a Sup/Manager to assist. When you reach out to HR to see if they can help; you're informed to contact your supervisor, it can be very frustrating as someone who goes above and beyond for their members. Supervisors can definitely make or break your experience at Centene. I really wish something could've been done about that aspect because that was my only issue. Overall, the company is a great company. The Supervisors need a reality check. "
Centene,Appeals and Grievance Coordinator,4,"Enjoy the flexibility with schedule and work life balance.  And the ability to do job without micromanagement from supervisors. Pay is good, but no bonus structure."
Centene,Director,4,The folks here are legit mission driven. Great remote work option! The pay is also very competitive and benefits are solid as well. I would recommend to others. 
Centene,Program Coordinator,5,Great place to work at and their pay rates are good. The teams are always great to work with they always help each other and is a little bit stressful when you received calls back to back.
Centene,Coordinator,1,"Hectic, unorganized and micromanaged. It was great in the beginning. But after a few years went downhill fast. Job was misrepresented from the beginning. Leadership is only interested in metrics. Hard work gets you more work instead of a pay or credential increase. You can move up if you brown nose the right people. The culture is reminiscent of high school and very clickish. The calls are ridiculous s d the work load is unmanageable. If you’re looking to be stressed to the max 40 hours a week, micromanaged down to the minute, overworked, underpaid, patronized, gas lit and made to feel inadequate this is the place for you!  Typical day is non stop calls for every unit except the one you were hired and trained for. The hardest part of the job is doing everyone else’s job. The best part of the job is finally clocking out at the end of your long day. "
Centene,Registered Nurse Case Manager,5,I feel supported by my manager. I am able to manage my day to meet my goals. I am able to take time off when needed. There is training on the new phone systems. Expectations are clearly layed out. 
Centene,Janitor,5,"I've work at the day shift job, what I've believed I've learn was to help out people who are needed for help., the management was nice, the hardest part about the job was you have to like mop the hard floor which lot of time the floor, doesn't like clean up fully. But what I've mostly enjoy of the job was it was a fun experience for like exploring around the place and was like cleaning up and watch blue ice hockey team play around. "
Centene,Quality Practice Advisor,2,"good training and structure, alot of procedures and policies in place. downside is extremely micromanaged and many unrealistic expectations for employees. "
Centene,Manager,2,So sad that this company is in complete disarray. Culture is talked about but not practiced especially with the most senior of leaders. Navigating in such a large organization with many silos is extremely difficult.  Feels like the company is getting ready to divest and sell. 
Centene,Long Term Care,1,Management is clickish. They were  always out to stab you in the back. Passive aggressive. Too big of case loads. Management is out of touch with reality  and what the guys on the ground do. 
Centene,Service Coordinator,5,"So far, so good. Supportive work environment. Hiring was long but very smooth and company communicated well. Training is thorough and supportive. DEI is a strong commitment with the company. "

Centene,Manager of Learning and Development,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Lots of opportunities but they layoff groups annually in August, so security is low. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lack of security.  Layoff in every department annually. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful.  Leadership has unrealistic expectations."
Centene,Operations ,1,Management is terrible and does not care about employees. Culture is not good. They set very unrealistic goals and only want to make themselves look good no matter what it takes. 
Centene,Operations Analyst,3,"The people are great, but the Corp should change its motto to “Improving the health of the community when statically relevant.”  Pay and culture was better than average but too much outsourcing leads to language barriers which in turn cause member abrasion due to misunderstanding of issues and poor first call resolution. There is a reason why Medicare has rated WellCare with only 3 stars. "
Centene,Provider Relations Representative,2,Poor management. The managers there are setting unrealistic goals for the provider engagement representatives and putting a lot on there plate. It was extremely stressful 
Centene,Referral Specialist,5,Easy processes and ability to move up on the company as long as you meet your metrics. Remote work available which makes a nice work-life balance with the opportunity for OT.
Centene,Customer Service Representative,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Working from home. Having weekends off.  The pay was decent, but not enough for the average workload.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Providers and members yelling and not being able to use the bathroom when you need to.  Also the management was horrible.  Not worth the stress.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It’s a diverse group of people who work together and the work environment is that you work from home.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Taking 50-60 calls from members and providers."
Centene,HR Assistant,5,Very good management.  Very good employee benefits.  Nice work/life balance.  You earn PTO and are able to take FMLA after a year of employment.  Oftentimes free lunches and galas.
Centene,Pharmacy Operations Specialist,1,"Horrible managment ,  supervisors dont know how to review claims or how to use the system. Too much stress and no opportunity to move up , not good company to work fot "
Centene,Clinical Review Nurse,4,Great work/life balance. Flexible. Good money. No micromanaging. Teamwork is good.  Not a lot of chance to promote. Stagnant. Do not feel like I make a difference. 
Centene,care coordinator ,3,"room for growth, good culture, fair pay.  micromanaging and productivity standards get tiresome but okay for a short term job and to learn from and grow"
Centene,Care Coordinator,5,"Quite honestly, we have it made. Work from home, great pay, great benefits. Not much else to say. A lot of work, but that's expected. It's work. If you do your job, you'll see the rewards."
Centene,Actuarial Analyst,4,Interesting work but low pay. Culture was good but dependent on your team. A very large company so easy to feel like a cog in a machine. Great people to work with
Centene,Communications Specialist,4,"While I have been employed less than 90 days, my management support and team have all been responsive, engaged, and committed to their work. It is a highly regulated industry, so that can affect innnovation, but the general environment is very supportive. "

Centene,Application Software Engineer,5,Not sure about other teams in the company but I could not recommend my current coworkers and manager enoughFlexible with your schedule/appointments(within reason)
Centene,Concurrent Review Nurse,3,I have been in the company for several years and there is no opportunity for professional growth.  Most of the leaders have less education then the employees. You only move up in position if you are friend with someone. They cancelled bonuses for most of the employees. Only the leadership staff receives bonuses.  
Centene,Software Engineer,3,It can very from project to project on how they handle OT for salaried employees. Management can be great and usually is but is always changing so sometimes you can get stuck with a bad manager. Since the manager is always changing Centene usually catch bad ones quickly. 
Centene,Sales Representative,4,Great opportunity to build your client book of business grassroots style. Go in the community and build relationships and work your leads. You have to be patient to build your book but it is doable and you can have fun whole doing it. My Team and Manager was great. Overall corporate culture is great.

Always a hurdle to get through in order to provide excellent service to the clients.   Sometimes too many layers of employees in order to obtain correct information.
Centene,Case Manager,5,Love the job and culture! They care about their employees and providing work life balance. Easy company to go over and beyond for! Open door policy. Many benefits. 
Centene,Customer Service Representative,5,No complaints so far. Background check process is a bit much but totally understand! Pay is low but at least you can work from the comfort of your home.
Centene,Assistant,1,"*Typically push older people to little holes that don't provide opportunities or challenge and then just lay them off. * Benefits used to be better. They give choices but all are more expensive.* If your manager doesn't like you, then you are going to be cut* Don't take care of people if their manager leaves"
Centene,Bilingual Customer Service Rep,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Remote work, the experience the many opportunities, the entire company has value!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Time management, that comes with all jobs.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's a very clear & open to all cultural experiences.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Great conversation & communication"
Centene,Manager,2,Unless you worked for another large insurance company you won’t get promoted. Benefits are OK. 401k is terrible.  Worst leadership I have ever experienced in a large company. No formal training 
Centene,Registered Nurse Case Manager,4,Have a good workplace culture. The pay could be better. Great problem-solving process. Management is always willing to help solve problems and have a good work/life balance. 
Centene,Data Analyst,3,"Very very much stress, demands are high.  Upper level VP level mgt are often clueless mid level (director) are often just former sups and managers.  I'm stunned at some but there are also some good ones.  Work life balance is not good due to work load."
Centene,Team Associate,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Opportunity for growth within the company. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Learning all the knowledge that changes consistently to stay compliant with state regulations What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Everyone is helpful and the company takes pride in recognizing all cultures in a welcoming way to learn.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy… fast pace. A lot of call volume from members and providers.
Centene,Advanced Claims Analyst,4,"A typical day was fast paced, detail oriented, and pushed you to stay on task and goal oriented. Daily work reflected actual outcomes and a team of people available to assist if needed. Training was top tier to ensure a great start to success and opportunity for growth within this company. "
Centene,Case Manager,1,You have to report every single thing you do. And don’t you dare taking a break to go to the restroom. You are only entitled to do so during your morning and afternoon break and/ or mandatory unpaid set lunch time. I trained for a day and I knew immediately that this would end up being a toxic environment and not for me. I moved on right away.
Centene,Manager,2,"It started great. Within a year, the true colors come out. The company culture is abysmal. There is no transparency from leadership and there is micro-management to the hilt.  Employees are not valued for making suggestions but chastised for daring to ask questions of their leaders."
Centene,Customer Service Advocate II,5,Work is okay. I feel upper management can show they care a little more being that we work hard and diligently to make sure all customers are satisfied by the time the call is over 
Centene,Business Analyst,3,"When I started it felt like a growing, thriving, and really fun place to be. The onboarding provided by HR was great, but as far as team training went...it barely existed. I asked a lot of questions, tried to make connections so I could make my job easier, and tried my best to learn. There were ways to learn but that learning was not often coming directly from the team and you had to make a lot of initiative to succeed. I was on multiple teams and had some outstanding managers and some that could have used some leadership training. Overall I felt like I grew in my role and was able to capitalize on those skills to find a new role. The great parts were many of the people I worked with, the flexibility of my schedule, and the remote work. However there have better days at the company. There has been multiple layoffs since 2021. The company is constantly restructuring teams and some of those choices did not make sense or help balance out the needs of various in demand roles. I mostly enjoyed my time there and will miss the work I did, but I did not enjoy being asked to do a lot with very little resources and without consideration of the impact of not being able to have expressed boundaries. The company culture has changed as a result too. What used to feel like a huge collaborative environment feels hostile and people are on edge. I used to be able to get work done but I started having constant meetings and meetings ABOUT meetings. I would then have to spend time outside of normal work hours to get work done. I would caution curious applicants or people considering offers to really - more..."
Centene,Program Associate Fidelis Care,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Absolutely nothing. The company is dysfunctional and unprofessional.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?No training or guidance by management, you are expected to “just know”What is the work environment and culture like at the company?High stress, anxiety, little pay no growth"
Centene,Case Manager,1," It was amazing to work for. I wish I could have stayed; my family needed me. I was more than unworked, so I had to leave.   Management was rough   On the SH side "
Centene,CSR - Customer Service Representative,1,"I worked at Centene corporation for around seven months during the pandemic season. The training was good and long, but once you are on your own with calls it is terrible. They put you into teams which constantly changed management, and I was on several different teams during my short time there. It is terrible because it did not allow me to bond with my coworkers. The straw that broke the camels back was having to go back to office. Also they would constantly monitor your calls for quality and constantly berate you for everything you forgot to say during the call. It is a stressful environment, and I got high to deal with it (clean now thank god)"
Centene,RN Care Manager II,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The autonomy of the position that includes the varied member experiences in assisting members seeking care and resources.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?I wouldn't say stress, but  occasionally addressing multiple member needs occuring at once to ensure they all know concerns are being addressed.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Pleasant, non-punitive and supportive.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I start my day with an open mindset to keep organized from the previous day and ready for unexpected changes per each member's needs, as well as keeping alert of organizational updates."
Centene,Accounts Payable Associate,3,The most enjoyable work was before Centene exists. I enjoyed working with Fidelis Care NY. People are so nice to work with. They are not only your coworkers but they could also be your friends. I missed those days working with Fidelis Care working with intelligent people but fun to work with.
Centene,Claims Analyst,4,"For the most part, Centene is a good company to work for. Great Benefits, flexible schedule. However in the last 2 years, they are more results driven than showing current employees appreciation."

Culture was promoting diversity and learning.  Enjoyed that part. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Came in at the same time daily and each day was unique due to our clients that we served.  Always a hurdle to get through in order to provide excellent service to the clients.   Sometimes too many layers of employees in order to obtain correct information.
Centene,Customer Experience Representative,1,Management was by far the worst I’ve ever seen since being employed by that company. Training was unorganized; if you asked a question during training the man training you would get impatient and his responses would either be rude or he’d simply not answer to ur questions. After training they’re also all over the place when giving your job duties. I was employed for one thing and they had me doing something totally different. -1/10. 
Centene,"Manager, Business Development",3,I worked so frigging hard at this company. I learned a tone. The work was incredibly stimulating and impactful.Base pay was low but overcome but excellent bonuses.
Centene,Customer Service Representative,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Just the interaction with the members. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The exigency of some leads at the average standards time on the phone call and how bad they deal with people (employees) with disabilities. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?When you really need an immediate response, there's no leaders available to answer you and the minutes over the phone are running against you. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Bored or back to back calls. A busy day is when you have to deal with complicated cases."
Centene,Program Coordinator,1,"The only thing that was good was the pay but, horrible management and no trainers or employees there to train you efficiently!! They end  your job immediately without even talking to you and set your up for failure from the very beginning.. Watch out for Jeff that will promise to make you successful and only sets you up for failure immediate termination knowing that there is no efficient training there at Centene and Management is very aware of it but only terminates you for no fault of your own when they know they are a failure themselves at even trying to teach new employees because they seriously lack knowledge of their own jobs to even know what they are doing there in the first place.  This is a HORRIBLE place to  work!!!  Don't even waste your time with this company!!!!!!  "
Centene,Customer Service Representative,4,Great place to work. I have nothing bad to say about the company. Good supervisors not soo much of being micromanaged. If you looking for a good place to start career.
Centene,Senior Accountant,2,The expectations are often unrealistic. The workload is too much for one person and management doesn't want to add additional people to assist. Processes are inefficient and suggestions to improve fall on death ears. 
Centene,Senior utilization review nurse,4,I was with the company for 11 years. Leadership is very flexible. My supervisor was a micromanager. Worked some Saturdays which was not very demanding. 
Centene,Customer Service Representative/Call Center,3,"I was recently ""uptrained""  to also handle a different department which has always been separate from provider services which is member services. There is no change in my hourly pay whatsoever. I only received 3 days of training where people coming into that job get weeks. Also I relocated almost a year ago from AZ to CA where the cost of living is higher. People who are hired in CA make more than I do and I have been with thus company 7 years."
Centene,Long Term Care Case Manager,2,"Management will depend on the area of the country you work in. Centene has some great leaders in upper management positions who seem to care about employees and company culture. Mid management however can be poorly trained, unsupportive and unhelpful to their teams as they focus on profits and fear for their own jobs. The work can be enjoyable but the management creates unecessary and additional paper work for staff above what is required from their contracts. It causes lots of conusion and burn out hence the revolving door and constant training and hiring."
Centene,Business Analyst,4,Great work place but no opportunity for growth. You have to play into corporate politics in order to get promoted even if you exceed expectations and are great at your job.
Centene,Service Coordinator,4,Worked from home. But by the end. Every thing was checked by supervisors and needed over justification.  Not about helping people get what they need. It was about how much could you not give to save the company money. 
Centene,SIU Investigator,5,"Fully remote, good time off (18 days until 7 years then it's 23), pay is pretty good. It's an easy job to learn and then once you master it then you have learning opportunities. Flexibility depends on your manager. "
Centene,Provider Network Specialist,1,Got terminated for naming dance songs.  Just rediculous company.  Managers was bully’s .  The company goals was to be nice and friendly and yet the management was not.  
Centene,Registered Nurse (RN),1,"I wish I could give 0 stars! Ever since it went to shared services, it has all gone downhill! No one knows what is going on, no communication and they hire anyone off the street without experience or critical thinking skills, which makes our job harder because we have to fix their mistakes and answer their ridiculous questions. "
Centene,Diabetes Health Coach,4,"The job overall was enjoyable. The managers were understanding and really cared about their jobs. Part time positions are not really offered. Productivity was heavily relied on which felt like professionals were being micromanaged for their time. Being able to speak, educate, and care for patients was highly regarded. No call and all federal holidays off and paid!"
Centene,Grievance and Appeals Coordinator,5,Good job good bonus good pay nothing really bad about the job just come in do your work and they’ll pretty much leave you alone all day really good company 
Centene,Patient Service Advocate,2,As a Patient Service Advocate you are expected to do so much in a very restricted and controlling environment. You have to learn so many applications for the position. The training is fast!!! There is no differential for employees that are Bilingual. Everything goes against you. You have to report every single thing you do. And don’t you dare taking a break to go to the restroom. You are only entitled to do so during your morning and afternoon break and/ or lunch time. I trained for a few days and I knew immediately that this would end up being a toxic environment and not for me. I moved on right away. The pay is terrible and not worth it for what is expected from you. It’s a shame Corporate America has turned into this. 
Centene,Insurance Verification Specialist,5,Working here was so simple and easy! May not be room for growth but it’s a solid job to have for the season I was in. Definitely thankful for Centene. 
Centene,Product owner,3,"Great team great coworkers lack of direction and leadership providedNo roadmap no plan past current program increment Lots of talented people leave due to toxic culture , lots of yelling and diminishing comments daily"
Centene,Utilization Review Nurse,5,Great managers and team members. Manageable workload. 100 percent remote including interview and training. Extensive training and ramp-up period. Very positive attitude among all staff. 
Centene,RN Care Manager II,4,What is the best part of working at the company?Good group of employees in our unit.  Good benefits.  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Stressful in that procedures to follow kept changing frequently and many employees had different ideas on how to follow procedures and that created even more confusion. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Usual corporate type of environment in that there are many layers of people and sometimes did not feel as personal. Culture was promoting diversity and learning.  Enjoyed that part. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Came in at the same time daily and each day was unique due to our clients that we served.  Always a hurdle to get through in order to provide excellent service to the clients.   Sometimes too many layers of employees in order to obtain correct information.
Centene,Pharmacy Service Representative,5,"Great job all in all but just need to get through this big change , pretty rocky right now on all sides but they definitely need to get it organized  "
Centene,Senior Project Manager,4,"Over promised. Overworked to keep up so was extremely stressful. It’s not clear whether or not all teams worked at the pace we did in our group, but it was just too much. "
Centene,Clinical Service Associate,3,Centene is very cut throat they have let go many great employees.  Laid off many people everything changed once the old CEO passed . That's all I have to say.
Centene,Review Nurse,3,All I can say is that there are better options.  The caseloads are alot for a day. lets see how it goes over the next few months. Supervisor is great. 
Centene,Care Manager,4,I love the fact that the company implemented flexible scheduled and compressed work days. My managers have been great and I don’t feel micromanaged but the goals are seeming more and more impossible. They constantly change goals and then  gives so little time before auditing on a whole new process that they came up with. Pay can be better and our insurance sucks. It seems our pay is on the lower end compared to other MCOs. 
Centene,Customer Service Representative,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Horrible place to work. There’s a different program for everything, training is not clear and management is rude. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management is rude and they threaten your employment weekly with testWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful and on edge, if you’re numbers aren’t up you will lose your job What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful, anxious and constant calls without help"
Centene,"Manager, Network Development",3,"Centene is a good company. Pays well with good benefits.  A lot of changes currently, feels unstable. Do more with less resources culture mentality.  "
Centene,Customer Service Advocate,5,"I am having a terrific time working at Centene. All of the people here are very communicative with me and are dedicated to making me the best version of my myself. I can’t help but to thank all of my leads, supervisors, trainers and teammates for making an environment that is the most welcome I’ve ever felt. "
Centene,Data Entry Clerk,5,"Overall good place to work. The benefits are great and so is remote work. There is issues with lack of communication and knowledge sharing, which leads to feeling like you have no help sometimes."
Centene,Review Nurse,4,"This job has great pay and benefits but you have to stay on your toes. There are a lot of growing pains. I was moved to 6 different teams in 1 year and had to learn 3 new software systems while maintaining production levels. Also, not provided with rescources to properly do my job. This company can be night and day depending on the department and supervisor. There isnt a lot of consistency between departments and the culture is very different from one team to the next. A lot is left up to local management so if you end up on a team that is not a good fit it takes a lot of work to try to move to another team. "
Centene,Correspondence Coordinator,4,"A typical day at work would consist of different things depending on the department you're in. For instance in the Mail Center, you would grab a tote of mail and open it then prep it depending on the state plan that you're working in. In a Correspondence Coordinator role, you would log into your computer and read emails, then you would open your work basket an get a new batch, you would then key any fields you can find information for, then submit the batch and on to the next."
Centene,Referral Specialist I,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?As a former  employee of Wellcare / Centene. I started as a  Pharmacy Clerk ended my tenured as a Referral Specialist  making $17.00 per hour finally ended with $19.71 per hour after transitioning too 2 sperate departments processing  both pharmacy and medical prior authorizations after 4 years and 1  month working with the company was great until I had laid off twice do too a sudden reduction staff issues due to what was supposedly due company buisness needs and structure with both  Wellcare and Centene companies being under the same work umbrellas. It was great working for the company which because the merit increases, yearly bonuses and departmental raises where pretty lucrative, opposed too average of other know companies in the industry.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Being micro managed. Some of the supervisors and team leader really like show off as if they have serious power trips. If you are not in their I quote and unquote work  ""clicks"" then you are froun apound and never get chance of being promoted or getting a raises even after proving yourself by OTJ "" on the job experience or previse work experience.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Centene Work environment is great never felt discrimination in type of form or fashion. This is very important to me in every work environment. Should be observed everywhere definitely would be pro vs con for me.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy depending what department you working on"

Centene,Communications Specialist,5,I love the team building atmosphere there.  They provided plenty of training. Everyone was very helpful. I worked remote so I wasn't able to meet anyone in person but the interaction was great online. 
Centene,Claims Analyst,5,Management is great. The hard part is you don’t get promoted but you need to apply for a position and it’s very competitive since Centene is a huge company 
Centene,CSR,4,"Originally was hired for providers but was eventually cross-trained for member calls as well. If you have thick skin to handle member calls, then this position is for you. "
Centene,IT Support Specialist,4,"Good entry level IT job, Remote opportunity was nice. Work hours was easy and most work days were an easy level to do. Had some issues with 3rd party help but that is understandable in this field."
Centene,Long Term Care Coordinator 1,5,"I go to nursing home and see 4 members, get their paperwork, visit with staff and come home and type in all the info for their assessments. In between, I walk my dog, wash clothes and cook supper for the family....yes simetimes i get bored but this is a great job! Procedures keep changing so stay alert but for the most part....I enjoy!"
Centene,Customer Service Associate,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Learning all applications helping in different departments making sure the member was happy it was a great experience What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Being new was stressful because I had not learned the system. After learning it was a breeze to assist correctly What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It is very fast paced many areas of growth and potential and the company core values are compassion and integrity What is a typical day like for you at the company?Fast and enjoyable pasted environment Answering calls explaining plan information taking payments or directing to correct dept

Comcast,Engineering Manager,3,Senior folks get into junior people's work leaving no satisfaction to the youngsters. Some people bring this bad culture and the upper management do not have transparently taking actions.

Comcast,Finance Analyst,4,"Big stress, decent pay and benefits. If you need money it's good but it will consume your life. There are options for advancement within the company but you may have to move."
Comcast,Field Service Technician,4,"Working for Comcast as a cable technician offers a mix of challenges and rewards. The job involves a variety of tasks, from installing and troubleshooting cable services to interacting with customers. Many technicians appreciate the hands-on work and the opportunity to solve problems on the spot.The training program is generally thorough, helping new employees develop the necessary skills. However, the job can be physically demanding and sometimes requires long hours, including evenings and weekends.On the upside, benefits can be solid, including health insurance and retirement plans. Team dynamics vary by location, but many technicians find camaraderie among their colleagues. Overall, it's a good fit for those who enjoy technical work and customer service, but it may not suit everyone due to the demanding nature of the role."
Comcast,Technician,1,Not too good of a place to work can't make any real money management isn't good it's hard to get your time off when deserved and there's no teamwork you're alone
Comcast,Sales Consultant,5,"Home Office Setup: Employees are expected to create a dedicated workspace with a reliable internet connection, a quiet environment, and appropriate equipment (such as a computer and headset).- Flexible Hours: Call center roles may require working in shifts, including evenings and weekends, to accommodate customer needs."
Comcast,Manager Software Development,1,"There are a lot of good people at Comcast. Unfortunately, they are only there for a short time because they will eventually be shown the door at one of the frequent layoffs. The senior leadership team, or SLT, as they like to be called, are quite out of touch with the engineering teams. They swoop in periodically to feign interest, then retreat back to their caves. Some of them work remotely while requiring everyone else to be in the office.Comcast culture has become toxic - people are encouraged to report others who aren't in the office for 8 hours/day. There are certain people who wander around daily and do ""bed checks"" of those who aren't at their desks, even if they happen to be in a conference room. They also run badge reports daily to see who is working remotely. If you are on the list, you will receive a lower performance evaluation and will be on top of the next layoff list. Because of this, there is a lot of distrust of fellow employees. The benefits are about average, or slightly lower. You do get Comcast internet and cable for free, but that's really the only perk.Pay is average at best. Promotions are few and far between. If you are outside Philly, you will be stuck in the same job with minimal pay increases until you are laid off.Comcast has a very strong ""woke"" culture - we receive frequent DEI communications and have to listen to many woke sermons from left-leaning ""leaders"" and peers. If your political philosophy differs from theirs, you best stay quiet, or else you will be on top of the upcoming layoff list.Most of my peers are actively looking outside - more..."
Comcast,EIVR Manager,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Working remotely was the only benefit that kept me thereWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?No directions from leadership What is the work environment and culture like at the company?On the surface supportive but always looking over your shoulder What is a typical day like for you at the company?Enjoyed working with the team I was on but a lot of woke whiners in the company
Comcast,Lineman,5,"Good place to workmand good benefits 401k and retirement, healthcare and fmla are also good. The on call part isn’t so mun but it paid the bills and paid off a car"
Comcast,Project Manager,4,"Great benefits, opportunity to work remote and room for growth. I’ve been with the company for 9 years and don’t plan on leaving anytime soon. Free cable and internet is a plus. "
Comcast,Inbound Sales Representative,4,"Comcast offers a great  insurance package and  benefits and courtesy services including cable, internet, phone, home security and mobile services.    "
Comcast,Outside Sales Representative,4,Pay was good but didn't last long. They disbanded and laid off the whole team only to restart the outside sales program about a year later or less. Still worth the experience I got.
Comcast,Software Engineer,4,"Great benefits, pay's ok, management has a lot of politics and disorganized at time. There's gonna be a lot of tech debt. Your mileage may vary by team."
Comcast,Field Sales Manager,5,"Fantastic company, with a strong culture and very employee centric policies. Plenty of room for growth, an opportunity to network within the business. Great benefits and wonderful pay would recommend."
Comcast,Quality Analyst,5,"Most room for growth I've had with any employer. Effective leadership, and plenty of opportunities for learning and career progression as well as work-life balance."
Comcast,Buisness Development Manager,2,"FreeWheel has a lot going for it — interesting technology, big-name clients, and a collaborative team. However, while there are definitely some positives, the work environment can be challenging for those looking for strong leadership and clear direction.Management seems well-intentioned but often struggles with consistent communication and strategic vision, which can leave teams feeling uncertain about priorities. The pace is fast, but at times it feels chaotic due to shifting goals and unclear expectations. For those who thrive in structured environments or who expect steady career development, this could be a frustration"
Comcast,Customer Service Representative,1,"Typical workday consists of pointless team meetings. Inflexible break times and constant calls from escalated customers. Work expectations require every metric to be met regardless of circumstances. No guidance on time management or process for meeting metrics. I learned about Static IPs. Working with systems that go down daily and are extremely outdated versions. I learned that the company does not know how to connect with customers on a genuine sincere human level. They are so corporate and fake that it’s painfully cringy. Management is a corporate ladder of people on power trips and are not held responsible for misconducts at the handbook policies carried out to hourly employees. You are made to feel guilty for days called out and are written up if you are late even 11 minutes, no matter the reason. The hardest part of the job is dealing with their broken programs that go down and even if this is the case, it can slow down someone’s ability to work enough tickets to meet all the metrics. If you keep missing your metrics for 3 months you are put on a plan. If you still don’t meet metrics for another 3, regardless of improvement or no real guidance on how to improve, you will be fired. management does nothing to improve work functions that employees are able to cheat ways to meet metrics, even when proving how this metric has been cheated. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work from home, and the health benefits. "
Comcast,Network Engineer,4,It is a fantastic company with great set of people to learn from. Good company culture and wonderful work life balance. One thing that could be improved is the internal processes.
Comcast,Mobile Specialist,3,It was not good everyday you are expected to do everybody’s job for them but you don’t get paid nearly as much as everybody else and it’s not even appreciated you can’t sit down but everybody else can you talk to 10 people while the rich talk to one
Comcast,Technicion,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Only benefit was free cable serviceWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?They overload you with work and always tell you there's no helpWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Go to first job get yelled at by customer,numerous times a day,get called and talked down to by managment,take lunch only to get another job added to you that you will be late for and get dinged for as a metric and lose your raise"
Comcast,Consultant,4,Work culture greatly depends on the team you are with. Company has a lot of latest technology to learn and good cooperative teams. Friendly Teams and supportive management 
Comcast,Engineering Manager,3,Senior folks get into junior people's work leaving no satisfaction to the youngsters. Some people bring this bad culture and the upper management do not have transparently taking actions.
Comcast,Operations Director,4,"Great experience especially when Comcast was growing and expanding.    Work can be demanding and challenging to turn work off and still succeed.   To grow and be successful, be ready to work 60+ hours/week.  "
Comcast,"Manager, Technical Operations",3,"Was a great career a few years ago.  Now, continuing to reduce headcount and using contractors more and more.  Not much job stability anymore in Operations anymore.  "
Comcast,Inbound Sales Representative,3,It’s been a ok job but over the years pay is going down and stress is going up. Recent changes have not been handled well causing things to get worse. 
Comcast,Commercial communications technician 4,4,Job started out amazing and slowly added more and more metrics micro management.   Still overall a good place to work but the feel atmosphere changed more towards hitting metrics than it was towards customer and employee satisfaction. 
Comcast,Senior Residential Technician,4,Job used to be fun with lots of chances for advancement. Now it's just a micromanagement nightmare. Pay is good if you can put up with the corporate BS. Expect to be overworked and then be told you're not doing enough. 
Comcast,Intern,5,Good very interesting learned a lot there. Was a very motivating environment. I think the thing that made it excellent was the support that I had and the knowledge people had 
Comcast,Sales,5,"My typical day involves prep work, engagement with customers, following up on leads and setting up service. We have several meetings a week. The hardest part is meeting metrics under pressure. We have so much time and resources to make improvements so no excuses are tolerated just results. I think it’s important to understand that it’s all about what you put in. If you enjoy people this is a great company to work for. Do your job well and you won’t have to worry about being jobless. "
Comcast,Administrative Assistant,5,"Flexible schedule , Good benefits and management. Employees feel valued and motivated when their hard work is recognized and rewarded. Rewards can be monetary, such as bonuses or pay raises, or non-monetary, such as a thank you. "
Comcast,Legal Analyst,4,by working with various law enforcement & gov't agencies-you really make a difference and feel good about saving lives and protecting children from predators
Comcast,Installer,5,"Great team work at this office.  If one technician fell behind schedule, another technician will come help out.  Everyone who is worked with was very easy going."
Comcast,Sr. Financial Analyst,3,I think overall it was a great culture but there are some teams where the company culture isn’t instilled. They could pay better vs the market but the free services are awesome! 
Comcast,Sales Professional,4,"I used to love working for Comcast and I still do, however when they make “business changes” the people it affects aren’t cared for anymore.  Being a Communications company, communication is usually last minute for everything that changes.  The company itself has Scaled back compensation payouts heavily in these last few years and advancement becomes less secure.  As an example I’ve watched someone get promoted within just to get let go due to downsizing.  That individual (along with many others)  was told they have 30 days to find something within and apply like everyone else, or walk.   They constantly try to phase out Tenured front line staff to save money that it makes competency a lot more difficult to come across.  Overall I enjoy my time with Comcast, and my schedule is flexible as well as having a nice work life balance, but the compensation is no longer GREAT it’s just ok.  Our services and process are hit or miss depending on your area however when it works it works well!  But when it doesn’t work your customers are quick to let you know and that sticks with them forever. "
Comcast,Retail Sales Associate,3,Was a decent sales job but every year the comp plan changes and usually targets high performers to pay them less. If you are an average sales rep it’s not a bad job.
Comcast,Application Developer Intern,4,I worked at Comcast as a Remote Application development Intern out of the Atlanta office for about 6 months. Overall the job was enjoyable. The pay was pretty good and my team was all quite friendly and helpful.
Comcast,Tech Support Specialist,1,I have worked there for over 16 years and the last 3 years have been the worst ever...they added a ton of stats and don't tell their employees how to make the stats and u get written up for anything there...seems there is a big push to get rid of stateside employees and use all outsourcers
Comcast,Comm Tech 5,3,Middle Management for techs more concerned about covering their a_ _ __s with upper management than watching out for subordinates Terrible retirement benefits. Once you retire company could care less how you built them. 
Comcast,Sales Associate,2,Good luck getting any alert when needed.  Pay was decent. Company doesn't care about their customers just how hard you can shove mobile down their throats
Comcast,Sale Enterprise,5,"Awesome company great place to work, great benefits, great work atmosphere and leaders. Really nothing negative to say about the company. I’d recommend "
Comcast,Associate Account Executive,2,Was not the job i was expecting but gained skills needed to get me to next job in a career area utilizing the markting knowledge i gained in the sales area 
Comcast,Technician,4,I have enjoyed my whole time working here. Who your supervisor are matters. Iv heard horror stories of people who have had bad ones. I never have thankfully 
Comcast,Engineering Manager,3,Senior folks get into junior people's work leaving no satisfaction to the youngsters. Some people bring this bad culture and the upper management do not have transparently taking actions.
Comcast,Technician,4,Great benefits  and perks. Employees get discount services for allLine of business. It’s very hard to move in the company overall unless you know someone or the timing is perfect to move up.
Comcast,Intake Specialist,4,Great learning experience. I left because I was contracted employee and my contract was up.  I worked remotely and the scheduling was very flexible.  
Comcast,Engineer 1,5,Amazing place to work. Culture and coworkers are super helpful. They really believe in helping you build your career. I would recommend anyone to join the team!
Comcast,Smb care rep,3,Great company to work for if you are a people person. Wouldn’t recommend to anytime with kids. Company makes you use your pto for everything so you never have time to use it to spend time with your family. If you have multiple kids you have to basically hero them at a distance so your customers don’t hear them.  won’t survive off the pay staying at 15.00 an hour. 
Comcast,Order Management,3,"They're a good company to work for Was unfortunate to be part of a company restructure and was let go. It was insulting because a week before we were told they were going to let us go, they bragged about how much money they made. Our job was being replaced by overseas workers and automation "
Comcast,Field Sales Representative,5,This is an amazing company to work for and you can tell by the tenure of the current employees. Seems like low turnover rate and everyone I've met has been a true joy to get to know. 
Comcast,Sales Associate,5,Nice job I would suggest it you’re young and have some patience the people there can be fun so you make of it or whatever ever nice job in the end ig 
Comcast,Customer Service Representative,2,Training was three months but the this time was not used well and could be easily improved upon.  Pressure to upsell on all calls and many call metrics to achieve with termination possible if you can’t keep up.  
Comcast,Business Account Manager,5,"Comcast is a great company, anyone should want to work there! I love the people and the business model they have! I wish that I worked at Comcast again."
Comcast,Development Engineer II,4,"Some teams are really good, some teams work on legacy tech. Make sure to get into the good teams like Sky/NBCU are good for SDEs. Some teams in Comcast cable are also great, just make sure the tech stack is nice and cloud based. "
Comcast,Inbound Sales Representative,1,"Comcast managers are liars and incompetent. I wouldn't recommend anyone working for them. They set exaggerated goals. There is absolutely no help once you get on the phones. They sell you a lot of ""family"" and ""opportunities"" in training that disappear once you're out of nesting."
Comcast,Manager,1,"Upper leadership threatens your job, complains when you take time off even though it’s your own time that you’ve earned. Difficult to get promoted even though you have the skill set, they post positions because they have to, but already know who will get the job. Horrible company to work for, treat employees poorly. Talk about no retaliation when you have complaints and that it’s anonymous but not true, HR always knows where and who  the complaint came from. Retaliation always comes next. Would never work for a company that consistently lies to their employees. This company deserves NO STARS but there was no option for that."
Comcast,Data Analyst,1,"I didn’t have a great time, workplace was toxic pay was low and most of the supervisors just took advantage of the better employees and let the others slack"
Comcast,Software Engineer,5,Very good work life balance.The managers and employees and are really good and helpful. Very good atmosphere as well. Like working there . Really wanted to go back
Comcast,Forklift Operator,4,"Overview: As a forklift operator, my primary responsibilities involved moving, stacking, and organizing materials within the warehouse. I worked closely with the shipping and receiving teams to ensure that products were accurately placed and ready for dispatch.Pros:Team Environment: The work environment was generally positive, with a supportive team that helped each other out during busy periods. We often collaborated to meet tight deadlines, which built a strong sense of camaraderie.Hands-On Work: I enjoyed the hands-on nature of the job. Operating the forklift was satisfying, especially when handling complex tasks like maneuvering in tight spaces or organizing large shipments.Routine and Stability: The job provided a steady routine, which made it easy to plan my days. The company also offered consistent work hours, with some opportunities for overtime.Cons:Physical Demands: The job was physically demanding, especially during peak seasons. Lifting heavy items and constantly being on the move could be exhausting by the end of the day.Monotony: While the routine was stable, it also became monotonous over time. The repetitive nature of the tasks sometimes made the work feel less engaging.Safety Concerns: Safety was a major priority, but there were occasional challenges with older equipment. This sometimes made the job more stressful, as I had to be extra cautious to avoid accidents.Limited Advancement: Opportunities for career advancement were limited. While the role was stable, there wasn’t much room for growth or promotion within the company."
Comcast,Customer Account Manager,2,"Get ready to be bombarded with ESG nonsense and pride flags in everyone’s background. Even as a work from home employee they set lock screens on your computer of the pride flag, don’t work here if you like to avoid tons of gay stuff. "
Comcast,Accountant,5,"If you have a good skill set and can communicate well with managers, they're willing to nurture what you bring and help you excel in your work.  Great coworkers, minimal politics and an all around good atmosphere."
Comcast,Sr. Project Manager,5,"Work life balance is fantastic, pay and benefits are solid, company cares about employees and their feedback. The company is always looking for ways to improve the employee experience. Highly recommended. "
Comcast,Cable Technician,3,"it is demanding and sometimes unfair. but it is an ok gig for a little while.If you want to advance your career, i would say just skip this place. But if you need cash then i guess it is ok"
Comcast,Sales Associate,5,"Overall it’s a good place to work and has good benefits, management is very helpful and will get you to where you want to go. It is very focused on sales of course "
Comcast,Engineering Manager,3,Senior folks get into junior people's work leaving no satisfaction to the youngsters. Some people bring this bad culture and the upper management do not have transparently taking actions.
Comcast,Customer Service Rep II,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?If you like a different schedule then what you are initially hired for then this is the job for you. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Getting yelled at by customers, constant change of schedule when you have children and a single parent, worried about getting fired while on FMLA. DEFINITELY the shift bids that you have to do. Overall just a stressful job.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's all a numbers game with them. They will fire you if you don't meet goal, are on FMLA or they just plain don't like you. They don't care if you are a single parent or have a sick family member that you have to take care of. They definitely don't care if one of your family members just passed away either. If you like being just a number and not enjoying your job then this is the place for you.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Back to back phone calls as soon as you get on."
Comcast,Customer Account Manager,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The worst experience I’ve ever had.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?All of it.  No leadership, wanna be managers with no training. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Sucks.

Comcast,Sales Engineer,5,Worked for Comcast for over 10 years and loved the company and the people. Benefits are great and management was good. The pay was pretty good as well. 
Comcast,Product Sales Support & Analysis ,4,Major changes in management and department every 6 months it seems. However my department is remote and pretty chill. Just do the minimum consistently and be easy to work with and you'll go far. You have to network and get your name out there for a promotion.  
Comcast,Network Communications Technician,5,"Great team . Outdoors .good management, training available all year to keep up with new technology and products, Easy to get promoted if that is your goal , great pay and benefits "
Comcast,Sales Representative,4,"I like the company overall however it’s scheduling inconsistencies won’t work well for most people. Also, the constant change of company needs that are unrealistic in comparison to customer trends, particularly in sales, can be a bit frustrating. "
Comcast,Retail Sales Consultant,4,pay is good if you sell right. too much priority and pressure in some areas but that’s just sales.                                                       
Comcast,Utility construction coordinator,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Mostly the people, good benefits, and good perks. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management is more into DE&I then quality it mostly shows up in management they are for lack of better word clueless of who and what they are managing. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Environment was good fun to be around it has changed over the years to undue stress culture turned for the worst DE&IWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Was fun till brought in new management then undeliverable I left."
Comcast,Account Manager,4,It's a good company to work for great benefits. Hard thing is that they are constantly changing things. Nice thing is you do get a set schedule and do work from home also. 
Comcast,Technical Support Representative (TSR),5,My experience with Comcast is good and it gives me knowledge that I can qualify for a different job. They also have coaching sessions to improve your skills.
Comcast,Sales Representative,2,Hostile work environment . Everybody hates each other. Gossip gossip gossip. Management sucks so hard.                                                 
Comcast,Phone Representative,3,So a discussion on my review for this is that you will be busy which is good. Great benefits. And I think that this is okay for my review summary. But maybe not.
Comcast,Supervisor,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits, and could- workers you meet.   Depends where you are on culture they are vastly differ from one division to another What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Micromanagement in some areas.   If you work on phones that can be extremely stressful What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Some divisions are VERY negative culture with no desire to change thatWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Depends on day, some are good others make me want to leave"
Comcast,Account Manager,5,Great company to work for. Great benefits. Base could be higher but commission structure was good. They like to micromanage but it gets the job done. 
Comcast,Retention Specialist,3,"Had great benefits, pay was good too. Unfortunately, they closed the retention department down in Beaverton. Once it becomes inbound sales only, things went downhill "
Comcast,Field Technician,4,"Overall good place to work, good benefits and management. Winters are not fun but summer makes up for the cold weather. Company truck and tools provided"
Comcast,Fraud Specialist II,1,Toxic work environment with a heavy work load that will take a toll on your mental health. Call volumes are insane with zero down time allowed between calls.
Comcast,Account Manager,2,Poor training and they throw you on the floor by yourself with a supervisor who is never available. Dealing with customers who are paying very high prices for internet speeds for their business that is not even available no more because it NOT EFFICIENT ENOUGH TO RUN ANY BUSINESS. You her money taken away from your pay if you do a renewal and lower the customers rate with a promotion. They only care about selling mobile phones and making people switch to Comcast business mobile and if you don’t then you’re not really recognized for your hard work. They are very judgmental and you don’t feel comfortable enough to be yourself they always trying to compare you to a top seller and show how you should be doing numbers. If you have a to a family emergency they will put you in violation and on a probation period which can end in termination. It’s a highly stressful job and not enough Suppourt 
Comcast,Retail Sales Executive,4,Long hours very stressful and you have to put up with a lot but good money  . I also make a lot of money in commission . It is something’s worth questioning if it is worth my mental health though 
Comcast,Comm Tech,3,"They push so many surveys at you that they will remind you of that insecure girl you had a relationship with in high school that you would've liked just fine if she would've just stopped asking every five minutes if you still loved her. Instead you got tired of answering the same question and lost interest in her because she just wouldn't accept it. Giving negative responses are taken out on your direct supervisor even if the question has nothing at all to do with them, most surveys cannot be answered honestly. They try to push a culture of family and team, but you'll see over and over how employees just become another number through the meat grinder. Before one idea has a chance to work or fail someone with even less common sense comes up with a new policy that pushes out the last policy. Being part of a team there ultimately means you will be alone day after day and your numbers will be added to everyone else's (your team) at the end of the month, it doesn't mean you will actually be a part of a group working on jobs together."
Comcast,Engineering Manager,3,Senior folks get into junior people's work leaving no satisfaction to the youngsters. Some people bring this bad culture and the upper management do not have transparently taking actions.
Comcast,Priority Bulk Representative ,3,"Everyone was very nice. I  worked their for over 10  years.  I feel like everyone had a sense of pride and team work for the most part. I  quit because they threatened to terminate me because my sales % were a little lower than what I have done before. But after 10 years , I just didn't feel like it was worth all the  stress.  Full disclaimer I have  Cerebral Palsy and things are very harder sometimes  for me."
Comcast,Billing Analyst II and IT Technician,4,What is the best part of working at the company?Being able to work by yourself What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Trying to get customers to take surveysWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?It’s a great working environment What is a typical day like for you at the company?You do about 4 to 5 jobs. You will either have a completely new install or you will have to fix whatever issue the customer is facing
Comcast,NOC Technician,3,The job has great benefits but very low pay. Not many jobs besides customer service and or sales.                                                     
Comcast,Tech 5 MM COS,5,Comcast Business has a great environment and are very inclusive. I loved the people I worked with and my management team. They have great benefits and great pay compared to what is out there for the same types of roles at the moment. They are great at promoting from within the company and giving you options on how to progress your career. 
Comcast,Field Technician,4,"Working here was great. Good hours, good management depending on how your department is. Overall all good place to work with opportunities to move up fairly quickly compared to other jobs"
Comcast,Hardware Associate,5,A good place to start your career as engineer to learn hard to get a promotion sometime but all in al was good environment and good team to stay with 
Comcast,Crew Member,3,Ita a nice company to wotk for very esasu To work withthis people nice and very good person they thwart youu good andd breaks all good .nice enviromen
Comcast,Xfinity Sales Professional,4,Very stressful. Company makes bad choices and we have to be the ones to deal with it. Customer service for over the phone and chat is out of country and destroys companies visual of caring. To much fraudulent activity happening inside and out. ONLY DO SALES THROUGH STORES.
Comcast,Senior Technical Support Specialist,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Culture and benefits were excellent.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Too many calls to handle in a short period of timeWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?The culture was great, the best.What is a typical day like for you at the company?A typical day was awesome because of the culture."
Comcast,Sales Representative,3,Great training program and with alot of different departments within the company there is room to grow.  Has decent benefits and free cable and internet.
Comcast,Tier 2 retail sales rep,5,"my co workers were awesome came back to the company after a year long leave employees and management are really supportive, incentive change frequently and customers can be stressful at times but some of the most wholesome customer interactions happened while I was at Xfinity and it makes up for the one or two bad eggs. Overall great place to gain experience and meet new people fast  paced but also relaxing during down time.(miss the coffee) . The pay is Ok can really make good money during holidays and base pay plus commission is a huge plus. for benefits I'm still looking for a company to beat what they offer 10/10 in benefits. "
Comcast,Enterprise Account Executive,2,It is  high stress for sales and the stock  benefit does not materialize.  Improvement is slow. Delivery challenges.  The core business is dying as  people cut the cord.
Comcast,Supply Chain Manager,4,The company cares about your well being and provide opportunity for growth.  There are a lot of different avenues that are available via multiple departments to advance.
Comcast,Sales Associate,5,Great managers who actually care and easy to move up or into a different role. Benefits are also great and it actually feels like the company cares.. 
Comcast,CMO,4,"Good, great and Good job to be succesfullyyy. So interesting work in there cause very competitive. Soo good luck every one, and come to join with us in there"
Comcast,Sales Associate,1,"Clueless upper management, insane sales goals, and a strange points system. Along with being expected to fix cell phones and not make money off doing so all led to a frustrating and stressful job. Upper management will just laugh off being insanely expensive and just tell you to sell mobile, if you do well you won't get better pay or any bonus in your check, you get points which you can use to obtain gift cards of their choosing, also phone reps will blatantly scam a customer into a cell phone which will boost their sales and leave us in store with a customer upset with us. "
Comcast,Retention Specialist,3,"Micromanaged and back to back phone calls. Not allowed to leave phone queue even to use bathroom or you get in trouble. Not allowed to be off calls for more than 10 seconds to finish notes or get in trouble. Pay ok, vacation time good. Work load horrific and constantly getting screamed at "
Comcast,Sales Representative,5,"It’s easy to advance in the company, you just have to put the work in. There are times when business is slow but you just have to work around it. Benefits are great."
Comcast,Customer Service Associate,2,Not a long term solution. It’s  Fine if you’re in between jobs and need to get by but definitely an exploitative company.  Nothing is ever sufficient. 
Comcast,Account Manager,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits and PTO and growth opportunities What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Strict adherence to phone time and angry customers.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very inclusive , we all work remotely, so Teams and a webcam are always on.What is a typical day like for you at the company?On the phone with customers needing assistance. Team meetings."
Phillips 66,Supervisor,5,Cohesive work environment with strong upper management support. Benefits package is top notch.  Safety and Work life balance is a priority for the company. 
Phillips 66,Gas Station Attendant/Cashier,4,Nothing much to say it was a gas station. I didn't have that good of a experience at the location in belen. I worked hard but there was a lot of drama. 
Phillips 66,"Selmer, TN",5,its fun and a lot of people say its hot but its not that bad if you aint afraid of working hard and working in a fast place that will pay ok and it fun
Phillips 66,Specialist,3,The environment is very toxic and management does not care about employees. Constant lay-offs so everyone is always on edge. Pay is not as high compared to similar companies. 
Phillips 66,Assistant Manager,4,Its grate company to work for. I have learned a lot from it. They really care about their employees. Store really work with you to make you feel like home. Let you work by yourself and be happy.
Phillips 66,Analyst,5,"The people are Phillips 66 were really the greatest part of my experience. Oil and Gas pay and benefits are very nice and make it hard to leave the industry. There were times that the expectations given to my group were hard to meet, but communication with peers and supervisors was able to mitigate large issues."
Phillips 66,HR Generalist,4,"Good place to work.  Has good benefits, strives to do the right thing ethically.  Opportunity to advance depending on your skill level.  Good work/life balance.."
Phillips 66,Cashier/Cook,4,"A job worthy of having as long as you have a good team thats responsible in the categories of customer service and team work. You will experience several customers purchasing food and or drinks from the station also purchases of fuel such as; gasoline and/or diesel. Alcohol beverages, nicotine, CBD or THC based products even propane and a multitude of other  products are able to be purchased by customers so more than enough customer service is a priority at this job. Cleanliness of the store including stocking of all store products, floors and counters cleaned and store bathrooms clean as best as possible: APPEARANCE OF STORE IS A MUST. Always, make sure soda/water and/or tea/coffee, any other options such as; ice cream and/or slushes are filled and stocked a big thing to keep in mind is that those items are stocked matching the correct labels reconized by customers. Cook things for breakfast, lunch (especially on Sundays) and dinner for the hotcase foods normally fried foods like, fried chicken, egg rolls, catfish, fries or tater tots, corndogs and  other fried and not fried side items should be available as well as possible. Keep count of tobacco sales and keep tobacco products stocked at all times as that is a big purchase for a gas station. Be aware of your fuel stations outside and make sure they're working correctly, they're accepting cash and/or card, the pumps are working, most of all pay attention to no leaks coming from the fuel stations or around the area of the station. Always keep up on the cleanliness of the outside of the store as well; APPEARANCE OF A STORE IS - more..."
Phillips 66,Cashier,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Loved my customers greatly, loved the job, Miss the people and the in and out chit chatWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?just didn't like the way it was managed I guess. Worked really hard to not get a chance to do more like every other person did officially. Certain people usually targeted What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Fast pace and constant, great regulars and relaxed at slow timesWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Pretty constant on work to be done in this go go go industry. A day was tiring but fulfilling"
Phillips 66,Optimization Engineer,4,Title sums it up well.  I moved there in 2023 and have worked there I year.  I do like the work but I am far from family and there’s not much fun to do in Ponca city.
Phillips 66,Controller,5,Great pay good benefits not much to move you up but all in all a good company work life balance is ok but not great you learn alot and have skills you can use 
Phillips 66,Instrument Technician,4,Managment is not so well but overall a good place to work. Nepotism is very high here. Company vs Union is a constant battle. Can make a good living out here if you can handle the bs
Phillips 66,Catering Assistant,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Extremely busy catering unit but it was a good teamWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Didn't have any stress issues What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Although Agency we were accepted by everyone. Would definitely go back if asked What is a typical day like for you at the company?In and ready for work leaving,quick cuppa before start then all hands on!"
Phillips 66,Director,4,Overall a good environment. But constant “transformation”  efforts cause undue stress. Very large company cans sometimes difficult to navigate. But nice co-workers overall.
Phillips 66,Learning Designer,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Pay and benefits are great but the work atmosphere and management is extremely poor. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management will give you much more work and responsibilities beyond your role bc they’ve let go of so many people during business transformation. Extremely stressful. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very toxic atmosphere and culture. Say one thing and do another.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Intense and stressful. Never knowing you are getting cut.
Phillips 66,Crude Oil Driver,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?It's real professional. They will be by the book. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Nothing really. Just do your jobWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's oilfield. If you want easy, McDonald's is hiring."
Phillips 66,Operator/Laborer,1,Horrible management no work life balance   No training horrible culture. Union has no back bone to the company that constantly violates the contract knowing nothing will be done to stop them 
Phillips 66,Accounting Analyst,5,Working at Phillips 66 was a great experience the professional environment was inclusive and positive. The company  went in a different direction with it's accounting department. I upgraded my knowledge with the implementation of SAP -S/4-HANA. My supervisor was flexible and always available.  The most enjoyable part of the job were learning new things and meeting new people.  
Phillips 66,Maintenance Coordinator ,3,Never say never . Work salary 10-16 hours day I learned not to trust my manager and to lookout for myself and the workmates with me Poor management Hardest part was working SundaysI enjoyed what I did 
Phillips 66,Process Operator,4,"I’ve met some great friends here and overall it is a good place to work.  It’s going to have problems, just like anywhere else.  A lot of knee-jerk reactions by management they completely change procedures due to one stupid incident nationwide.  Once a safety procedures put in place it is good for about three weeks until everyone forget about it.  Overall, it is a safe place to work. Depends on what units they assign you to..  Overall, I have high thoughts for this company"
Phillips 66,Customer Service,4,"Your first priority every day, every shift is to meet the supply demands, and then be transactional support , for the customers. The remainder of your shift is tasked with stocking or cleaning. The hardest part of the job, was working in the kitchen. My favorite part of the job was , engaging with the customers, getting to know ppl in the community on a first name basis. "
Phillips 66,Supervisor,5,Cohesive work environment with strong upper management support. Benefits package is top notch.  Safety and Work life balance is a priority for the company. 
Phillips 66,Measurement Analyst,1,It's your typical big oil company. It's all about the money. They don't value you and what you contribute to the company.  And they definitely aren't concerned about work/life balance
Phillips 66,Cashier/Customer Service,2,Would close fri night and open Saturday and sun had keys and security codes and safe codes and keys to store  I would open make coffee get the grill going put donuts out 
Phillips 66,Laboratory Technician,1,"R&D was once a great place to be, now it’s just a joke. Upper management is clueless; direct supervisors lack any sort of skill or knowledge of supervising. Favorites get advancements for playing on their phone all day, while hard workers get “coached” and threatened with disciplinary action.What was once a fulfilling career has become a cluster-f.  100% do not recommend this company!"
Phillips 66,Contractor,4,"Great people, diverse and challenging workload. I worked on multiple projects in different units at the refinery. Good focus on Safety. Sadly, the refinery has closed."
Phillips 66,Billing Analyst,4,"Great coworkers.  Supervisors are hit and miss.  People are rotated into positions where they have no business, especially as supervisors.  I guess it's part of making their employees ""well-rounded,"" but it's not good when they are put into positions they don't want to be in or aren't qualified to be in and they have very little choice."
Phillips 66,Logistics Supervisor,4,"Phillips 66 has good benefits in terms of non contribution pension, plus 401K, employees choice of 19/30s or 9/80s, but many upper managers still have antiquated expectations for their employees.  The company says it has flexible policies (like working from home) but it's very manager/supervisor specific. "
Phillips 66,Project Manager,4,Overall Phillips 66 is a good company to work for but my particular department is very understaffed which makes for long and stressful days.  They let too many people go and have not been willing to staff back up. 
Phillips 66,Cashier,3,Under staffed and over worked. I was able to learn quickly but the fast moving customers whom already has their orders down make the experience not so bad. The drive through was the worst experience due to being the only one grabbing orders or able to. Management needing a break and time off over your life made life and work completely off balanced. Cleaning and stocking became the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customer courtesy. The work culture proved that women were lesser than the men who worked there. 
Phillips 66,Phillips 66 operations ,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Absolutely the worse company I’ve ever worked for What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lack of staffing and showing up 360 days a year What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic, hateful management, terrible leadership, bad union What is a typical day like for you at the company?Wake up, even on your days off and get called into work"
Phillips 66,Operator,5,"So for anybody that wants a job where they can get a raise every year until they get top pay after 3 years this is the place. If your looking for company match 8% paid vacation time off. No weekend work, so your able to have plenty of family time. Company bonuses every year. No prior work experience is needed just come to work with a good attitude and willing to learn. School tuition pay back programs. Job transfer to another location when available. Retirement pension programs. The best health insurance program around."
Phillips 66,Manager ,3,Very strict. The district manager will not let you do your managerial duties your way at all. They should just let the district come in. It would save them money.
Phillips 66,Gas Station Attendant,5,The most common form is an you to the right of your body or your mind and the body is a body of your choice to be a person of color or to have the right of choice in the first instance and to have a good sense for yourself to have the best possible life in your body as a whole in a sense that is the most beautiful and most important part to me is the most powerful and beautiful thing that you have to do in life to make yourself feel better about your life because of your own choices you are not a person you have a right to choose to make and to have your life to be able and to have it be a person that is your life and you are you have to have it is a good day to have it will always have it all day and I will always have the most important part is the best of all that I have to have the best of luck to me is that is what I can get the most beautiful woman and you are a beautiful soul I am a beautiful soul that I love and you have the best friend I am a very good day to me is the most important part about me is the greatest thing about being the most important part is the best thing to have the best person that I can do whatever I have a job and that is what makes it all worth the effort and the most valuable part is the ability for the people I work for to make the most of my time to be happy with my job so that they are able and I have the ability for the most value for them to have in me to make a better living than they have ever had before so that is what makes them a good friend 
Phillips 66,"Director, Business Development, Canada",4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Wonderful organization, great managers & colleagues! What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The disconnect between leadership expectations & the resources available to accomplish the deliverables. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great work environment & culture! Really great people!"
Phillips 66,Research Engineer,2," P66 R&D was a once prestigious organization in the 1970’s and 1980’s, but it has undergone step changes for the worse every decade since.Now it is just a shell that is a research organization only in name. R&D upper management has been unable to form a cohesive strategy for no less than ten years, and corporate is no longer willing to invest and expand on what little output R&D can produce. Like so many companies, MBA’s that know next to nothing about the core technologies are driving strategic choices. Their hard work has brought the company to the median among its peers at best.If you get in bed with a confederacy of dunces don’t be surprised to find the whole  is far worse than the sum of its parts."
Phillips 66,Cashier,4,Its an ok place to work. Easy job nice customers. Upscale neighborhood no ghetto b.s.what you would expect for working at a gas station.  Flexible schedule.
Phillips 66,Process Operator,5,"The pay, benefits, and bonuses are amazing. Just got to be careful with some people because they like to bring people down when they are in a bad mood. Some people here though will show you how the unit works and are willing to train. "
Phillips 66,Production Worker,1,My experience with Phillips 66 is that it’s a fast paced environment where the numbers are the only concern. You will hear safety first but realize fast that’s not the case. Management tells you what you wanna hear but never fixes or takes your concerns seriously. Your expected to work in 95 degrees weather in the summers with no air or concern for your safety. I would never recommend this as a place of employment for anyone 
Phillips 66,Specialist,5,This is the job I have for now so I am doing my best.  Am I happy? No.  Lots of acquisitions and mergers occurred tha didn't look out for the best of employees. 
Phillips 66,Lead Maintenance Technician,2,"This is a review of the savannah lubricants plant maintenance department. So I'll start with the biggest positive, it's the benefits, and from there the rest goes down hill. Maintenance pay is decent at best, when you look at what's being asked of you. So your team will consist of 3 techs(yes, 3 total! 2 on days, and 1 on nights) in a plant with over 20 tanks, pumps, gearboxes, etc. 4 different packaging lines, consisting with over 40 different types of equipment that needs continuous maintence and adjustments for operations, 3 truck off loading racks, with over 50 valves, actuators, etc. Your tasks, and crafts will include, but not limited to heavy mechanical, electrical, boiler operator, low level PM's(greasing bearings, chains, testing emergency lights, etc), locking out all  equipment for contractors, and yourself, draining oil lines, pumps, etc.....etc....  Cleaning machines that are never shutdown for proper deep cleaning, ordering parts, and materials for maintenance related tasks. Prepare for a very disorganized work culture and environment because the department doesn't have a planner, parts department, a dedicated supervisor for that department. As far as career growth? It's limited to nonexist, training is inadequate, higher up positions are filled by outside corporate yes men from various locations, and skillsets. The icing on the cake is you get to hear a billion dollar corporation complain about tiny trivial costs, at the same time bragging about record profits. If all this sounds delightful, then this is the job for you. "
Phillips 66,Staff Engineer,4,"As with any large company, things can be very bureaucratic.  The company, especially Midstream, has experienced a lot change the past few years.  Multiple initiatives to change ways of working, digitizing workflows, and reorganizing the personnel structures.  All the change can be distracting and make it hard to know what the company's direction is.  Overall still a good place to work, assuming you have a good supervisor (like any place)."
Phillips 66,Supervisor,5,Cohesive work environment with strong upper management support. Benefits package is top notch.  Safety and Work life balance is a priority for the company. 
Phillips 66,Operator 1,3,They will find any reason to fire you. Training is good location if good but they demand performance and  won't work with you if anything comes up even if it's an emergency. 
Phillips 66,Analyst,5,Get to work with great people. Corporate management can be disorganized. Decent pay and nice benefits. Get to work downtown. Large organization with lots of resources for the employees. 
Phillips 66,Supervisor,1,The leadership of the company is short sighted and only cares about quarterly shareholder return.  The company has no long term vision to be competitive in the oil and gas refining space.  (Outsourcing is not a vision) Zero commitment to the American worker or the communities they operate in.  If you want to work for this company treat it as a 100% transactional relationship and leave on your own terms.

Phillips 66,First Line Supervisor,4,Pros: Good compensation and hard work is generally recognized. Opportunities for advancement are available. Cons: can be long hours and shift work can be challenging. 
Phillips 66,Scheduler,2,Used to be a good place to work until the consultants arrived. The cutbacks have resulted in a huge loss of knowledge and those left behind doing double duty. Whatever gains the consultants achieved will be short-lived and offset by some major screw ups down the road.
Phillips 66,Mechanical Engineer,4,The company had great engineers but terrible middle level managers. There is a lot of nepotism. Children of GM’s and Executives get promoted to managerial positions at high salary grades over their more experienced and qualified peers. The managers that are not promoted through nepotism are a bunch of “yes men” bullies. Being a mid level manager is like being part of a club. Mid level managers will mess up so badly that a regular employee would be terminated. However they get moved into a cushy role like “business development lead” that has no direct reports and no real deliverables. All while collecting a high salary.

Phillips 66,Technology Specialist,1,"Working at Phillips 66 can be a challenging experience, particularly due to the toxic work environment and the constant fear of being laid off. Employees often face high levels of stress and anxiety, as the company has a reputation for implementing frequent workforce reductions and layoffs.The culture at Phillips 66 can be described as cutthroat and competitive, with little emphasis on employee well-being or job security. The company's focus on cost-cutting measures and maximizing profits often leads to a lack of investment in employee development and support. This lack of support creates an atmosphere where employees are constantly on edge, fearing that their positions could be eliminated at any moment.The fear of layoffs can result in a toxic work environment, as employees may resort to backstabbing and undermining one another in an attempt to secure their own positions. This can lead to a lack of teamwork and collaboration, hindering productivity and overall job satisfaction.Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding job stability can negatively impact employee morale and motivation. It becomes difficult for employees to fully engage in their work or take risks, as they are constantly preoccupied with the possibility of losing their jobs.Overall, working for Phillips 66 can be a stressful and demoralizing experience due to the toxic work environment and the constant fear of being laid off. It is important for individuals considering employment with the company to carefully evaluate their ability to handle such conditions and assess whether this environment aligns with - more..."

Phillips 66,Operator,1,Management thinks operators are the enemy.  Look down upon hourly workers and want to find fault instead of solutions etc.   There is big incentive to be lazy and not do anything because if you do anything productive you risk getting g in trouble with management.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?There was zero stress because there was barely anything to do. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?In the department I was in, the supervisor was so egotistical and he only spoke to certain people. Thought it was just him but his boss was the same way. Very weird dynamic in the Bartlesville office."
Phillips 66,Operator,4,The schedule sucks but you make a lot of money. Which isn’t always a good thing. The benefits are great! It’s a union job so be prepared to be the low man in seniority. 
Phillips 66,Data Quality Coordinator,5,They had you day covered from Coffee in the morning to Lunch etc.  The environment is fast paced but the people are knowledgeable and friendly. The buildings are clean and well kept. The is also a very secure parking garage. 
Phillips 66,Cashier/Kitchen Help,2,"The business had absolutely no structure. On my 3 days of training, I was taught 3 completely different ways of completing the end of day/shift paperwork. Over half of the inventory of the store hadn't been entered into the system and didn't scan. When I asked for the price of items so I could enter them manually, my coworkers told me different amounts each time. Eventually one admitted they just made something up. There was no one in charge. No one person leading in the store. Not even a seniority of employees to follow in place of a manager, just workers with nobody to go to with issues or a final say on rules or procedures except the owner who was often at one of his other 2 store locations or unavailable. "
Phillips 66,ECM Coordinator,3,"Coming into this company was a dream, overworked myself, which ended up being an expectation instead of being acknowledged, no room for advancement.

Phillips 66,Production Associate/Machine Operator,5,Hartford lubs plant was a great place to work. Just like any place you get what you put in. Management to supervisors where good to work with as well fellow employee's. But just like a lot of place you will have the one or two or little more Debbie downers and the constant griping ones. And they still work there and have for years so it can't be that bad if they haven't left. 
Phillips 66,Operator,4,"Like any other oil refinery it has its ups and downs. Maintenance and equipment is subpar. The benefits and pay are great. Union protection which solidifies job security. As any work place you have good and bad apples but you control what you can. Long hours and OT, which is a plus in my opinion. Holidays, weekends, nights. 12hr rotating shifts. "
Phillips 66,Plant Manager,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great working environment.  Great place to learn about lubes.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Small plant and everyone’s job matters, so weak links can slow things down and impact everyone in the plant.

However ketamine, terecia and hunter were awesome."
Phillips 66,Operations,2,Good money for what you do. Management likes to hear themselves talk and sound smart. Operators for the most part are good. Lots of drama and backstabbing that goes on. 
Phillips 66,IAM Analyst,3,"I was at P66 for 6 years. Was a good 6 years, but I was moved to a team that was the good ole boys and they werent very accepting of someone of color - which made the workplace very hostile. HR gave them ""diversity"" training, but as we all know - that wont change much. Good company, but like all companies - it depends on your team. "
Phillips 66,Process Operator,1,"Might be ok for like 5 years just to bank money.. expect no home life, poor management and “coins” as reward for hard work 😂 .. u can get a 5$ lunch with this coin or save up 4-5 of them over a year to get a hoodie or backpack with their garbage name on it"
Phillips 66,Mechanical Engineer,3,"Dying company. If you’re a ChemE and have a burning passion for refining then you might like this place. Otherwise, you won’t want to stay here long if at all. Good pay, good benefits, good work life balance in general. Toxic culture."

Valero,Operator,1,"If you don’t have a college degree, then they don’t value your thoughts or opinions whatsoever. They will NOT consider someone for advancement from your position no matter how good your attendance record, knowledge of your job, or ability to learn. The pay is ok at best. Supervisors are literally told they’re “non-working supervisors” and are incompetent and take micromanaging to a whole new level.  They won’t even help write work permits. Management doesn’t care and prefers to play the turn over game instead of investing in their senior employees who actually have the knowledge and ability to do the job well.  So if you want to work a job with mediocre pay that has little to NO opportunity for advancement then this is the job for you. "

Valero,Operations Supervisor,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great benefit package Competitive pay rateWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Short staff High turnover rateWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Competitive Buddy system on certain deptsWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Relief, shift meeting, unit meeting daily activities, report and relief shift change"
Valero,Mechanical Engineer Intern,3,"Pros: The internship project I received was a great learning experience and my department manager and mentor were really supportive and helpful. The company also threw an intern symposium which was an amazing networking opportunity and all expenses paid trip to Texas for a week ( while still receiving pay). Speaking of pay, the pay was great. They paid as much as my first job and offered a crazy 401k match. The cons:They shove their charity group down your throat. The events manager told the interns verbatim, ""you don't have to donate, but you will not move up in the company as quick if you dont"" and then told us we should start donating during our internship. I don't really vibe with feeling like I have to buy my promotions. They hire interns, but only if they are willing to move wherever in the country they want them. For someone who already has a life established, you can kiss your chance of being hired goodbye unless you are already where they need you. They pay the same starting pay whether you in a state with the lowest cost-of-living or the highest. So if they transfer you to California, don't expect that amazing starting pay to get you as far as if you lived somewhere cheaper. "
Valero,Process Engineer,5,"Worked for Valero for 13 years. High work load, but fulfilling work. Opportunities to see lots of different technologies. Enjoyed working for the company"
Valero,Maintenance Mechanic/Machinist,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Worst company I have ever worked for in my years of employment! The nepotism and favoritism showed by management at this company is unbearable and I am so grateful that I no longer work for such an egotistical rotating equipment superintendent anymore. The guy is so arrogant that I hated going to work everyday!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with brother in laws and friends of some of the management. Some co workers were first class, others were just little moles for the rotating equipment superintendent.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic! You can’t go to work with people undermining you to get ahead.What is a typical day like for you at the company?The worst i have ever experienced."
Valero,System Manager,1,You must be a person that graduated from a Texas school. I been here over 8 years and see the way they treat people that don’t fit in their cult. Mangers stick up for your team don’t let the I/S department be bullies (leadership)
Valero,Analyst,4,"The company values sometimes do not line up with individuals’ agendas, but the company has good intentions. A lot of opportunities here for advancement in your career."
Valero,Lab Technician,4,Great Benefits.  Focus on safety.  The team morale is not always good causing high turnover. More management presence and guidance is needed and to focus on company culture.
Valero,Sales Associate,4,"I worked here back in 2015, the structure was there. Management was firm but always willing to help. Co-workers were a mixed bag, some we willing to help and others were out for themselves. But this is type of culture is everywhere. Overall great experience working there."
Valero,General Laborer,5,Owner and supervisor are great to work for! Clean store and well stocked! Awesome food for being a convenience store! Great coworkers too. Actually enjoy going to work every day.
Valero,T/A Materials Manager,3,"The Valero way (in Memphis) is to let the contractors do all the work and the teamsters take it easy. This particular T/A team is the most toxic environment I've ever been a part of and I've been on over a dozen across the country. There were great people but Majority don't want to do their job, they pass responsibilities to whomever will do them and offer little to no training. Literally had 30 minutes training - Even though I was directly responsible for Valero assets. They have 2 Valero members (from 14 member team) and rest contractors. They say ""long term"" so they don't have to pay you per diem.  Poor culture with even worse leadership. I would avoid the Memphis facility at all cost and go to a real refinery on the coast somewhere. Stagnation is rampant and flight of good employees was taking place before their eyes. They feel like contractors are ""dime a dozen"" then complain about not being able to recruit good people!!! "
Valero,General Laborer,3,Helpful people but weird place. Everyone is fed up and wants to leave. They make you pick up garbage once a month. They can't seem to get people to stay.
Valero,Security Manager,5,The Valero Three Rivers Refinery was a pretty great place to work.  I was there for 7 years before moving back to the Corporate Office.  Some great people there!
Valero,Security Officer,2,"The security department management staff, allows unethical behavior from its supervisors and managers. If you complain now you’re labeled a trouble maker. The directors famous words- that’s the way it is, so if you don’t like it. Go work somewhere else. Very unprofessional for a Fortune 500 company "
Valero,Maintenance,2,"Management is pretty awful there. You will rarely be praised for doing a good job, but the second you make a mistake, you will be scolded to the maximum."
Valero,Associate Engineer,2,"There is little flexibility and a very toxic environment at the job. When I worked there, they had changed the sick day policy to only allowing four days per 12 month period. More than that and you were punished."
Valero,Board Operator,2,"I've been with valero for 18 years. They've provided a good living for me and my family and had been a great place to work for many years. However, management has completely gone off the rails and has made me absolutely hate my job. "
Valero,Process Operator,1,"Slave drivers! No room for advancement unless you know someone that works in Admin. They will not allow seasoned operators to move or what they call ""bid"" to other units. Morale is very low, no true leadership or guidance.  "
Valero,Engineer,3,"Good place to learn and grow early and career, but not sustainable for family life. Advancement opportunities are very limited. Staff is nice, but expectations on project timelines are usually unrealistic with how lean the company runs. This usually results in blame on those who hold no power and have to come up with a compromise."
Valero,Not disclosing ,3,"Yes Men are promoted no matter how inept they are. Imagine if you will a CNA being in charge of a neurosurgeon.  The pay is great, low level management is clueless and their higher ups know it. They are kept though because they're robots that would jump into a volcano if told to. Remember, Yes Men are what the company wants.  OH and if you want to get strong armed into donating to the United Way as if this is the 1930s with la cosa nostra in charge, this is right up your alley! It has never been said in an email, but has been said in person by many managers that your future raises and or promotions are based on if you donate to the United Way or not. It could be a really great place to work if they would stop promoting yes men with IQs of carrots. "
Valero,Credit Specialist,5,great benefits they pay medical. Holidays off more than 1 day during Thanksgiving and Christmas. Enjoyed working with my co-worker's. Great Christmas party's. Pay could always be better. You get annual raises and good bonuses once a year. 
Valero,Assistant,5,Good place to work. Environment is cooperative.  Pay is good.  Benefits are great.  Union and management seem to work together well.  Overtime is no excessive.
Valero,Process Operator,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The benefits were the only good thing about working there.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Never see your family, on call every day you have off, constantly being worried about management either firing you or putting you at unnecessary risk of life and limb.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Management is hostile and is only looking for yes men."
Valero,"Port Arthur, TX",1,What is the best part of working at the company?Not one thing it's good at this company besides the moneyWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?This is the most corrupt place I've ever been involved with What is the work environment and culture like at the company?No integrityLies CorruptionNo communicationExtremely unprofessional supervisionVery poor leadershipWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Like being in prison or with the devil is the only thing comparable
Valero,Process Operator,5,"Excellent place to work at. Valero always ensured that you were well trained, confident, and best of all completely safe. I will absolutely recommend to anyone searching for work within operations. "
Valero,"Instrument - Analyzer - Electrical Maintenance Planner, QA/QC",5,"A typical day at Valero Aruba Refinery Corp. was very interesting. Collogues, were always happy.Learning gadgets, programs and materials were always available and ready to approach.I was employee since the Aruba Refinery was refurbished by Coastal Ref. Corp., USA, Jan 1990.Living close to the facility, travel hours was minimum. Culture was formidable. Job was a daily enjoyment. Being member of the Firefighter, Rescue and Hazmat team was also tremendous. We were always aware for safety and the actions."
Valero,Operator,2,"It was once a great place to work at, but Management turned the place into a Circus.  No one that’s a Supervisor is qualified to lead in the field.  It’s all about Profits and not safety."
Valero,Senior Enterprise Architect,5,Great company that considers its employees as a biggest assets. Great pay and benefit. Very competent and dedicated co-worker and company is very supportive.
Valero,Operations,3,For the most part the management team does not care about the physical or mental well being of the employee. Safety is only “as needed” when needed. Most managers have no experience and only placed in their positions because of the buddy system. Was so much better under Diamond Shamrock. Valero buying them out was the worst thing that could have happened to the refinery. Just the turnover in people the last 3 years should tell anyone what they need to know about work there. They can’t even keep shift  or unit supervisors. Now they have decided to take away breaks from maintenance employees. Poor management and getting worse.
Valero,i and e tech,2,to much management and not enough workers. The amount of time your as work is ridiculous. Unsafe and way to many accidents. moral is very low also .. 
Valero,Stagiaire en ingénierie,5,I appreciated my passage to Valero as an intern.Varied tasks and sympathetic and helpful work colleagues.Several mandate at the same time and necessary support.
Valero,Operator,3,Make as much money as your heart desires. Be expected to work on scheduled days off. Turnover is very high and always short staffed. Work itself is pretty easy 
Valero,Lab Technician,4,"The people in the lab are what truly make the job shine. There is a lot to learn, and things are relatively stable as you gain more experience working. A minor downside is that there is always a bit of troubleshooting going on as things breakdown here and there. However, it is also an opportunity to gain new skills and expertise. All and All, it's a laid back job with decent pay, and good people."
Valero,Security Manager,5,The Valero Three Rivers Refinery was a pretty great place to work.  I was there for 7 years before moving back to the Corporate Office.  Some great people there!
Valero,Operator,4,Had better jobs before here. Don't waste your time working for this company. They only care about there time off and not your. It's not a family friendly place.
Valero,Clerk,3,"Typical gas station job. Management was distant and unreliable. Coworkers were nice. Just normal stocking, cleaning, and checking out customers. 2/5 stars "
Valero,Shipping and Receiving,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Good people to work with.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Sometimes the long hourWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very upbeat What is a typical day like for you at the company?Very smooth work environment.
Valero,Lab- senior fuel tester and asphalt tester,2,I would not recommend tiisjob to anyone who wants a person life! It’s like joining the army... I give it a 2 out of 10... managers Re very demanding... some a good a few are horrible 
Valero,Console Operator,4,Pay is good but low compared to other refineries. Operations is expected to be perfect while watching other crafts mess up regularly. It's good when the unit is running and hectic when there's a problem. If you can make it 30 years without a single mistake you'll be ok.
Valero,Operator,4,Good paying job if you don't mind working your life away. I have witnessed many 10-30 years guys get let go for any mistake. Management and HR are always changing so they don't appreciate your decades of dedication. 
Valero,Operator,4,Working at Valero is a pretty good job. Sometimes there’s a lot of OT and sometimes there is none. Only downfall is how old and outdated some of the equipment is.
Valero,Process engineering intern,3,"Great learning experience, good structured intern program, other engineers and managers are welcoming and happy to help. Hands on, fast-paced rewarding work."
Valero,Alkylation change house attendant,5,"Brilliant place to work, rate of pay is good. Must be able to work alone and as part of a team in a fast paced environment where you can have a laugh but must adhere to the site health and safety standards"
Valero,Operations,3,The company has become notoriously short staffed and the mantra has become do more with less. The old saying of we put our employees first and they are our best asset is out the window. No longer is this a place of pride in feeling that we all work here. It seems lately it is a stepping stone in someone's career as there is mass exodus.
Valero,Manager,4,It is a place where you can develop aptitudes but the pressure is constantly everyday . Casual environment but sometimes you can not apportion new ideas
Valero,HSE,5,Good pay and benefits. Company is resistant to new ideas outside of what's always been done. Large company with solid policies and programs. Lots of corporate involvement in day to day operations. 
Valero,Lab Technician,4,"I don’t have too many complaints about the job itself. My biggest issue is that there’s not much upward mobility in this job if you choose it as a career. You’re generally stuck in the position you’re in unless you somehow get lucky with people retiring. Working hard only gets you so far here, at least at the facility I work in. "
Valero,Plant Operator,4,"I recommend this company if you are looking for long term career placement, but if you have other aspirations, you may find it burdensome or stagnant at times in the first few years. "
Valero,Unit Supply Specialist,4,"Needs to learn about work/life balance, Not flexible with working from home,  good pay and benefits, mostly friendly atmosphere, stable work environment"
Valero,Senior Engineer,4,Excellent engineer experience for entry level engineers.  Non-managerial engineer paths need to be better structured to allow technical experts to stay and excel.
Valero,Assistant Operator,3,MICROMANAGING!!!!! They go overboard nitpicking stuff and some safety procedures actually make the job seem ridiculous. If you can handle that then it's a good fit for you.
Valero,Manager,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The pay was good.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The childish nature of the employees at the refinery.  They did not being led by a young minority, so they made up things to cause stress within the organization and as a manager, I received no support from upper management and HR to root out the bad apples."
Valero,Engineer,4,"Upper management is often promoted based on ability to drive all the productivity out of individuals as possible.  Organization runs lean, and doesn't often cut Valero employees, but it leads to a lot of stress and work load creep."
Valero,Human Resources Coordinator,3,The company runs short of staff in each department. Each person is covering the workload of two or three others—military-style rankings with ego-driven dynamics select management. Frequently have to defer up to get an answer on something that you are qualified to make the call.
Dell Technologies,Project Manager,5,"They care about your personal and professional growth, work life balance is great. You can be rest assured that you have a family type bond as teams are typically no more than 12-14"
Dell Technologies,Sales Associate,1,The RTO mandate was the last straw for many. Dell has been not caring about their employees for years and hit a boiling point when they announced RTO with 2 days notice. 2Days! I had to scramble to find child care and there was zero understanding from managers and higher ups.  Morale is at an all time low and management do not care. No career growth.
Dell Technologies,Inside Sales Representative,5,"Dell was a great first job out of college and gave me a lot of great skills to progress my career! Training was fantastic, management was fantastic, and the office community made it exciting to come to work every day!"
Dell Technologies,Manufacturing Line Worker,3,"There is no issues with the work. Most areas are laid back once the work is completed. 90% of the people you work with are lovely. The shift is an amazing shift. Many people stay because of the shift.As a contractor under Flexsource it’s a hopeless future sadly as your contract is only 11 months and then your left go and get a call back after 100 days. Minimum  wages + shift allowance, no benefit's,no opportunity to become a full time employee with Dell. Over time is slim. "
Dell Technologies,Sales support,3,Colleagues are all nice people.Got AWS from 14 days to 20 days(Increases by 1 day for each year of service)Provide flexible benefit(RM2000)Hybrid work arrangement
Dell Technologies,Presales Solutions Architect,5,Got promoted 6 times over my 8 year career there. Lots of opportunity for advancement and role switching.Had 70% travel job. Expenses were easy. Great management and mentorship. 
Dell Technologies,Sales Manager,4,Very supportive of employees. Pay is above market and benefits are very good. Executive leaders tend not understand frontline individual contributors daily challenges. They add last minute meetings and policy changes. 
Dell Technologies,Storage technoligist,4,"good place to work, Good team that wants to do well for their customers. Some managers think they are technical when they are clearly not. Overall a good place"
Dell Technologies,Senior Project/Program Management | Strategy & Ops,3,You learn a lot working at Dell. The job changes day to day and you are never bored.There is lots of visibility at various levels. Senior management is mostly male with a huge lack of diversity.Huge layoffs regularly at Dell. All employees are expendable here.
Dell Technologies,Sales Coach,3,The people that work there are one of a kind and overall fantastic. The company will make decisions that will negatively affect the sales teams but if you can work through the mess you will find yourself in a promotional opportunity quickly.
Dell Technologies,Data Center Operations Associate - Librarian - Tape Media,5,What is the best part of working at the company?They took care of their employees What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Never felt stressful working in my department I worked 12 hour shift the days went by fast What is the work environment and culture like at the company?There were all walks of people there .What is a typical day like for you at the company?I really loved my job so a typical day for me was coming in doing my job and going home happy
Dell Technologies,Marketing Analyst,4,Enjoyed my time here. I had great manager that supported me and genuinely wanted to see my succeed. I know of other co workers who had horrible managers but I just got lucky.
Dell Technologies,Technical Support Engineer 1,3,It’s a great entry level job for out of college or need a job but it is not a place of advancement quickly. You will need to be there for awhile before you can advance.
Dell Technologies,Customer Service Associate,4,"I learned to consistently deliver exceptional customer service,  will go above and beyond to help my client, and provide top-notch products, and outstanding outcomes for the company /client, "
Dell Technologies,Solution Architect,5,People around you are most meaningful for developing your career in best way and this what you can be sure about it  when working for CSC in Limerick .When you join Dell is so hard to find your field of responsibilities and people around you are just amazing  to cooperate  .You might be not sure about your skills setup and how to use them but management will have idea about you and your role. This is my first job in IT sector and i just enjoying every day!
Dell Technologies,Sales Engineer ,1,Salaries are not competitive at all.They have a lot of constant change of the structures by Layoffs very often.Which does not allow to form a work group dynamic according to the expected goals
Dell Technologies,Inside Sales Representative,4,"Great place to work. Interview process is intense but went quickly. Training academy is amazing.  If you are new to sales or a seasoned veteran,  the training is a great opportunity to learn and grow. "
Dell Technologies,Client ProSupport - IT Support Specialist,5,"Dell was a great place to grow my skills in Customer Service and IT, with very thorough training, and a huge emphasis on doing everything possible to help the customer.Team leads are ever present and totally invested in your success, and the feedback received is very helpful. The workload can be intense, but it is manageable."
Dell Technologies,MArketing,3,"Good company until for more than one year there is no longer Budget at all and fire without hiring.They assign you more responsibilities without increasing your salary and give you any excuse.Gaslighting at its Best, but if you don't mind to have more flexibility, it is your best option."
Dell Technologies,Technician,4,"I worked here for over 10 enjoyable years.Good facility with canteen, car-park, gym. Company supports education and personal development. paid fairly and work load was realistic. ."
Dell Technologies,Manager,5,The benefits are great. They care for the welfare of their employees.especially health. They provide meal carss to ensure that employees have meal allowances that would help sustain work life balance 
Dell Technologies,Project Manager,5,"They care about your personal and professional growth, work life balance is great. You can be rest assured that you have a family type bond as teams are typically no more than 12-14"
Dell Technologies,Sales Account Manager,3,"Dell is a great company. Poor clarity and logic on the accounts provided to work, and no logic in the Quota. No job security as there is lay off expected every 6 months. Leadership is focussed on their growth and continuity in the system, terrible pressure and gets work done by threatening like sidelining, job loss etc. People arr good but the culture forces them to be brutal with team members and to each other. Also zero employee engagement especially for people in sales. Good part is Dell is a leader in AI and GenAI infrastructure, the Incentives, good medical insurance, abundant training modules, strict L&D mandate etc. "
Dell Technologies,Analyst,2,Lots of messy excel to work with. A lot of layoffs happening. Flexible but you will be working long long hours to be able to clear all your work. Lack of focus and direction. Lots of non-work related tasks to do.
Dell Technologies,Project Management ,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Colleagues are the best part of working at Dell.  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lack of work/life balance.  Lack of transparency from leadership.  What is the work environment and culture like at the company?In my experience it is very challenging, lack of transparency from leadership, no work/life balance.  Poor management.  What is a typical day like for you at the company?Typically it would be a 10 - 12 hour day.  Starting with meetings at 6:30 am for a solid five to six hours.  In order to meet deliverables I was required to work long days.  There was the flexibility to take off for medical appointments.  However, deadlines needed to be met hence working late into the night."
Dell Technologies,ISR,3,"Dell is a good place to start if you are new to the city or maybe just out of college. However, the work is boring and the leads are NOT warm. You will meet good people but you will also burn out quick."
Dell Technologies,Financial Analyst,3,"Benefits are good Pension, healthcare. Flexibility with Hybrid work model. Cons are Poor management, worked weekends and bank holidays. Risk of redundancy "
Dell Technologies,Cyber Security Advisor,1,"I can't stress this enough that Dell does not care about their employees. The company is a complete mess. You would think being a billion dollar company they would run like a well oiled machine, but it's the complete opposite. "
Dell Technologies,Director - Dell Global Support & Deployment Operations ,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Opportunities to support at a high level.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?None to speak of.  It was always a changing environment and if you focus on results, you will thrive."
Dell Technologies,Inside Sales Representative - Contract - Temp. (hybrid- remote),4,"It was a fun place to work and a good experience but the pay was low.  Typical work day was monitoring email inbox, working on a project & repeat, management was cool, lotscof office events and amazon gift cards. Great company culture. "
Dell Technologies,Software Engineer,3,"One of the highlights of working here has been the people – they're fantastic, and many at Dell would agree. However, the atmosphere lately has taken a turn for the worse. Layoffs seem to be happening non-stop, even as the company posts impressive results. There's a lot of uncertainty about the direction things are heading, as the focus on AI feels like it's being pursued without a solid plan."
Dell Technologies,Senior Technician,5,Work is too much. Nice perks. Salary Good.bmanagement is doing micromanagement. Company is downsizing due to recession. One can grow if puts hardwork. 
Dell Technologies,Server Procurement Senior Analyst,5,"In my role as a Server Procurement Analyst,  I'm responsible for performing daily cost reconciliation. I believe this position will help me understand the underlying logic behind the data, allowing me to provide valuable feedback to manufacturer. Effective management is crucial, focusing on delivering results within deadlines. The workplace culture at Dell emphasizes building strong relationship with other departments to achieve our tasks collaboratively. The most challenging aspect of the role is the need for extensive communication with various departments to ensure alignment and coordination. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part is learning and utilizing various tools to enhance data validation and improve efficiency. I'm excited about the opportunities for continued development within the company. "
Dell Technologies,"Team manager Global Partner Management, Field Services & Operations EMEA",2,"What is the best thing about working at the company? Not a Great Employer, High Targets, QUITE STESSFUL PAY CAN BE Good Provised Targets Are With Or Exceeded What is the most stressful working at the company? Unrealistic Targets and Unrealistic Timelines to Reach Goalshoe areThe working environment and working culture at the company? Unfriendly, Sometimes Even Hostile Culture, no respect for the individual What does a typical day look like at the company? Work Hard During Long Workinghours"
Dell Technologies,法人営業職,1,"Exchanges among employees are not very common.There are things prepared by the company, but it is not functioning well with a high degree of freedom.There is a gap between occupations and there is almost no exchange between employees.It may be dry only for foreign companies.Of course, employees are working as many employees other than Japanese because they are foreign companies.Relatively quiet."
Dell Technologies,Systems Engineer,5,"Good pay and very kind and helpful people at Dell. Everyone is supportive of you as a person, not just as a worker, and give you flexibility to live the life that you want to live."
Dell Technologies,Team Leader/Supervisor,4,"Worked in a very people orientated department in Dell - it's a busy team, but mgmt always had time for the people & looked after them very well. It was a hybrid role & very flexible. "
Dell Technologies,HR Business Partner,5,"Good benefits, ok salary but no wfh options and no growth opportunities in the organization. It was better in earlier times and the culture somehow has changed now."
Dell Technologies,Senior Software Engineer,5,"Good company to work for except frequent layoffs recently, flexible working hours,good culture, benefits,competitive salary, activitiesCares for employee wellnessNo of leaves are good"
Dell Technologies,Gcm,4,Dell technologies is a decent company with some good leaders. The culture is slowly changing in the last few years for the worst due to constant layoffs and constant changes in strategy. 
Dell Technologies,Software System Principal Engineer,1,"I worked remote for four years - never met any of my team in person.I was routinely passed from team to team and required to ""pitch in"" regardless the language or the technology.  I actually enjoyed that part, because 1) it kept me from having to interact with my toxic manager, and 2) I really love a technical challenge.However, when my manager wanted to give me a nickname, I objected.  Thereafter I was known as ""condescending."""
Dell Technologies,Quality Coach,2,"This company suffers from poor management and abysmal communication. The best employees often leave out of frustration, leaving the remaining staff to pick up the slack. Unfortunately, this means that the remaining hard workers are burdened with the work of their past colleagues due to the remaining less motivated staff get away with doing nothing. Despite this, there are no incentives to retain good staff—no recognition, nothing. It's a frustrating environment where effort goes unrewarded and morale is low."
Dell Technologies,Project Manager,5,"They care about your personal and professional growth, work life balance is great. You can be rest assured that you have a family type bond as teams are typically no more than 12-14"
Dell Technologies,Sales Associate,5,"Team work, environment, motivation, support. Without these it's not that great.  It all depends on who direct manager is.  Only good with a good manager"
Dell Technologies,Computer Hardware & Networking,5,In my ideal workplace I value open communication and teamwork fostering innovation and aligning with your company transparency and collaboration focus
Dell Technologies,Technical Support Engineer,2,"DELL used to be a great place to work. Recently it has become a nightmare where my management in the dept I work for is all about numbers. They really don't care for the mental health of their employees and have a big retention problem. Yes the work could be daunting and stressful, but they make it a nightmare."
Dell Technologies,Account Manager,4,"Pros: Great culture, hybrid position, lots of support, good benefits. Cons: career stagnant, average pay, lots of metrics Verdict: If you're fresh out of college this would be a fantastic opportunity "
Dell Technologies,Customer Service Manager (CSM),1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Pay was good and bonuses good as well, great benefits package as wellWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The awful senior management team and processes/ procedures What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Would be good if Management and senior management weren’t so up themselves What is a typical day like for you at the company?Changes everyday which is good"
Dell Technologies,Project Manager,4,"Excellent culture overall. Very good compensation and benefits, but the organization keeps changing, which makes it quite challenging, especially considering long-term development. Not sure if it is in the correct direction. "
Dell Technologies,Inside Sales Representative,2,"Dell uses so many different tools that you need to scrub just to find out if you can work an account. Their CRM is also flooded with duplicate accounts, so it is a slow process. They cap your commission and give very minimal raises once you get promoted."
Dell Technologies,Technical Program Management,5,"I joined Dell through Restart program, I had alot of help and support in the initial on-boarding and it was a very well-catered process, i had to learn a lot of info about the companies i worked until midnight or sometimes 1-2am watching reading alot of materials from the dell, it was a big organization to go through and understand all the different departments it was a lot of information, everyone was very kind and helpful to me, I had a mentor who helped with career advancement and my managers were also supportive and kind to my career growth.  i was sick during covid period and couldn't go to office and was time-off for few weeks I think i did not explain it or somehow i wasn't accepted too well due to my absence at work from illness...  I was finally laid-off during the covid-19 mass lay work workforce reduction and my position was eliminated.   there is a typical work culture in a tech firm in America, typical corporate America work culture, i really like the job and the people managers and the cutting-edge technology is a bonus, it's a great company for people who want to get into tech company jobs. I would welcome the opportunity to work at Dell if there is a openings available and remote jobs.  Now sure how to go back and find jobs in Dell?Getting to the office was difficult for me, I have issues with wake up and going to work drive on the high way sometimes i get exhausted tired but can't relax had to be alert and work hard.. it's a bit tiring on my physically and mentally stressful at the beginning alot of things to understand at once.. it was better after 6 months. - more..."
Dell Technologies,Analyst,5,Great experience getting to work alongside talented people. Supportive team and great place to learn and grow early in your career. Office and perks are nice as well.
Dell Technologies,Coordinator Assistant,5,"Amazing benefits and support, they really take care of the employees and there's lots of support to learn sometimes of volatile with the changing markets but generally a great place."
Dell Technologies,Support Technician,1,"The job is stressful, on top of the customers calling in yelling at you, each year higher and higher expectations are put on you from the company with no extra time to get them done. Managers watch you very closely. "
Dell Technologies,Senior Program Manager,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?100% remote working which makes a lot of sense when most people I was working with are in different countries/time zones!  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?never lived up to the published company values, perhaps in the US it does but not in AsiaPac.  In my last few months had a new manager who had zero people skills and would not listen to you.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Had little contact with people outside of my team (other than customers) but was supportive within the team.  Management focus 100% on revenue generation rather than doing a quality job.  Process and procedure would be overlooked if it impacted delivering revenue.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Frantic, never enough time to do a job as thoroughly as you would like.  Always an expectation you would work additional hours."
Dell Technologies,Senior Principal Systems Development Engineer,1,What is the best part of working at the company?It is ok kind of company and not much challenging work. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Politics is too much in the company. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work environment is stressful.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Deal with political manager to save your job.
Dell Technologies,マーケティング,4,"Sales are strict with various rules, but if you belong to a global team, it is freedom and it is very easy to work.On the other hand, the best lukewarm water is perfect, and there are not many people who work and work.Excellent people will quit.If you want to work moderately while doing a side job, or want to work slowly as a main business with priority on child care and hobbies, I think it is best.Those who can do it are unsatisfactory and stop without irritation.From now on, it is likely to proceed with US for a while."
Dell Technologies,Data Center Specialist,4,"Working at Dell is mostly a pleasant experience. The company offers competitive pay, excellent benefits, and fosters a strong company culture. However, the biggest issue is the constant influx of workforce reductions over the past three years, particularly in sales and other departments. This creates a lot of stress, as you never know if your job is secure. Additionally, upper management does not always listen to employee feedback, making it difficult to feel seen and heard at times."
Dell Technologies,Account Manager,3,"I have worked for Dell for over two years with a consistent track record of exceeding sales goals by 50% plus. I was in line for a promotion for over a year and then never got the promotion after they changed their remote work policy after telling me it was fine for me to move remote. They do not give pay raises for cost of living increase and view most lower level employees as expendable. My direct leader was a great person to work for. The upper leadership was awful and viewed employees as just numbers on a spreadsheet. Overall, they have good benefit packages, but lower than average pay with little to no chance of moving up in the company unless you were a DEI candidate who lives near the office. They will throw you to the wind when given the chance. Performance is not their top priority when it comes to promotion. "

Dell Technologies,Senior System Engineer,5,"Nothing really, the only thing I regret is that I left the company due to external factors. The management is always carrying, including the upper management, ready to help and implicate various resources to get the job done and take care of the employee. The remote culture was very strong, even before pandemic time, providing 3-4 days per week of work from home - that was something unseen and unbelievable for that period. The projects were very interesting, with the right amount of work - achieving a perfect balance between work and personal time. In conclusion, Dell became my golden standard to which I report every job I get. "

Dell Technologies,Territory Account Executive,4,"I met the best people in my life at Dell. Dell also tried to work me into my grave. It is not possible to be successful at Dell unless you forgo everything except work. Dell promotes from within, so you can count on having excellent managers. ""Team"" is a joke at other companies -- NOT at Dell. You will also build an incredible professional network. I made a great deal of money at my last Dell position, but you are going to have to decide: what is most important, being able to work regular hours and not giving up your weekends, or Dell. Can't have both. Would I go back? If I was still married and if I had kids and family to support, yes. As a single person with no family, never. "
Dell Technologies,Inside sales Representative/ Account Manager,4,Working at Dell has one of the best things happened to me as I have started my sales career with them. we had healthy competition and helping management when we could not solve an issue. Very competitive salary if we do beyond the given work.
Dell Technologies,inside sales,3,"It was a very rewarding job.The evaluation is divided depending on the sales business together.Basically, I work at home, and most of the meetings at ZOOM.A business trip once or twice a year is generated.Occasionally, dinner with customers occurs.The cost of the mobile phone and the Wi-Fi fee can be settled.If you have a good performance, you may increase the salary in the year."
Dell Technologies,Product Manager,2,"As a former employee of Dell Technologies, I feel compelled to share my disappointing experience with the company. My time at Dell was marred by a number of significant issues that reflect poorly on the company’s management and work culture.Firstly, the work environment at Dell is highly bureaucratic and stifling. Despite the company's claims of fostering innovation and employee empowerment, the reality is quite the opposite. Decision-making processes are slow and convoluted, with multiple layers of approval required for even the simplest tasks. This inefficiency not only hampers productivity but also demoralizes employees who are eager to contribute and make a difference.Moreover, the management at Dell is disconnected and unresponsive to employee concerns. During my tenure, I experienced a severe lack of support from my supervisors. Feedback was rarely solicited, and when it was provided, it was often dismissive and unconstructive. There is a pervasive culture of favoritism, where promotions and opportunities for advancement are given to a select few, regardless of merit or performance."
Dell Technologies,Technical Support Engineer II,4,"Dell has really good benefits for medical insurance, pet insurance, school reimbursement, PTO, paid sick time, paid vacations, paid parental leave and paid certifications.The salary was not super competitive but I think the benefits could make it for it."
Dell Technologies,Ingénieur Commercial,2,"This beautiful company has become not recommendable for a possible candidate is constant, small toxic management and wages below the average of the sector because the objectives are voluntarily out of range all the procedures put forward internally to promote well -beingAt work and surveys which reveal a very worrying situation the management turns the head. Permanent acquisition of employment as the departures desired or not in the company multiply during this time the charge increases for those who are still in the company mustpeople is taken very seriously in this company without having the slightest competence"

Dell Technologies,Sr. Advisor Talent Acquisition,3,The most enjoyable part of the job is offering positions to candidates.It is a remote work culture that has now enforced a Hybrid model.Management is very supportive.You learn a sense of balance between work and life.
Dell Technologies,Director,4,"The company is known for having a great culture, fostering a positive and collaborative work environment. However, despite this strong cultural foundation, the organization is currently facing widespread layoffs, which have affected many employees. Additionally, the company has recently implemented a policy change that no longer allows remote work, impacting the flexibility that many employees previously enjoyed."

Dell Technologies,Principal Software Engineer,3,"Dell is a great place to start your career. Career progression varies by department but it's often clouded in politics and how people perceive your skill (not what you are capable of or have achieved). Unfortunately, compensation and perks are not great."
Dell Technologies,Senior Account Executive,2,"Exciting appearance company.The years passing I noticed a serious degradation of working conditions.We quickly felt abandoned in our team.Although humans seem (on the facade) to be at the center of the project, the feedback to the HR of many problems have never been followed by actions.

Dell Technologies,Intern,5,"The work experience at Dell is amazing, whether physically or remotely, because I can do my best, due to excellent work tools. I have learned a lot every day, especially about how to do my work.Amazing and I see them clear in my leadership, which became inspirations for me as a professional. The hardest part of work for me is about the maximum time of the workday of 06h for being an intern.Depending on the amount of demands I get daily, I can't finish them on the same day of the request, getting a ""backlog"" from the previous day to do the next. The most pleasant part of my work is to be able to contribute to the team from which I am part."
Dell Technologies,Rotational Intern,1,"I had a less-than-ideal experience at Dell. They initially hired 20 interns but only ended up offering full-time positions to 10 or 12 of us. Those with master's degrees were often overlooked because of the higher costs associated with employing them. Regardless of the effort and quality put into our projects, undergraduates were often chosen for full-time roles, even if their performance was not as strong. Additionally, there was significant internal politics involved in hiring decisions, with many different parties influencing the outcome. Unfortunately, it seemed that those hired full-time were often from the same universities as the hiring managers, such as Cornell, MSU, Texas A&M, and the University of Texas. If you are from one of these schools, your chances of getting a full-time position are high, but for the rest of us, opportunities are limited. My advice is to take the internship at Dell, but also start networking with people from other companies, as the likelihood of securing a full-time position is slim if you are not from the preferred universities."
Dell Technologies,Sr. Kubernetes Engineer,1,"The very bad:Managers are atrocious, especially Indian ones.No respect for life outside work.No team cohesion or support.They expect you to be available 24/7.The OK:Base salary was decent at least.The Good:Work was fun and challenging."
Dell Technologies,Senior Advisor,1,"Sure, here is your review in paragraph form:---After dedicating ten years to Dell Technologies, I am left feeling deeply disappointed by the company's recent actions. While my immediate supervisors were supportive and provided a positive work environment, the overall experience has been marred by significant issues. Despite my contributions, including projects that saved the company millions of dollars and consistently positive year-end reviews, there was a lack of long-term recognition or reward for my efforts. The recent layoffs, which cut 13,000 jobs, came without any prior notification and were handled with misleading information from upper management. This lack of transparency and communication left many of us blindsided. Although Dell provided a few months of severance, the decision to lay off such a large portion of the workforce feels like a betrayal, especially considering Michael Dell's significant personal wealth. This decision has shown a concerning lack of commitment to the employees who have worked hard to support the company. Moving forward, Dell needs to improve transparency and communication regarding major corporate decisions, recognize and reward long-term contributions, and ensure upper management aligns more closely with the values and efforts of their employees to prevent similar situations in the future."
Dell Technologies,Senior Computer Technician,4,The benefits are good as far as a large corpo goes. Your enjoyment and pay on the job will be up to who you are friends with/ how much you are likeable. Unfortunately and there is plenty of instances where people fail upwards (myself included).
Dell Technologies,Senior Technical Analyst,4,"Great work environment, most mgrs are great , support team development, you just don’t know when the layoffs will happen in your department, work life balance is no longer a priority, It’s all about the profits projections not the long term or older employees.

Tesla,Assembly Technician,2,Management expects everyone to go above and beyond and kiss their butts. Repetitive work gets tiring but time flies. Free food is a plus. Best part of the day is clocking out.
Tesla,Electronic Devices,5,"A topical day at work consists of trouble shooting and maintaining testers. I may not learn new things everyday at work but over time, I learn how to prioritize issues. The work place has its issues like belonging in a circle if you want to advance or succeed. Not a good culture. The hardest part of the job is covering many production lines but I enjoy coming to work because I always look forward to new challenges. "

It's very busy an time do go by fastWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Learning new areas enjoy getting too work on different parts of the car
Tesla,Inside Sales Advisor,5,"Tesla is honestly the best company I have worked for and I regret losing my job because I really did have it good. It can be scary when layoff season comes but if you are doing what you need to do and doing the best you can an your skills show what you e learned or have, then you will be fine and you can Mo w up the latter and move departments. You have a support system set up and they set you up for success you just gotta put in the work everyday.  Benefits are amazing and pay is great . The hiring process wasn’t too bad. "
Tesla,Production Associate,2,"If you don’t mind not being called your name even though you’ve told everyone how to say it, being forced to work while injured even after the doctor gave you a note, and working 4x12’s while running off of 3 hours of sleep a night…then this is the place for you. They don’t properly prepare you for the production line at all during training. The line workers essentially govern things and if you’re not in one of the groups then they’ll talk to you like you’re a child even if you’re older than them. I worked there and for my entire first month no matter how many times i told them my name and corrected them, they still pronounced it wrong and had it wrong on the rotation sheet. HR is also impossible to get ahold of. It’s a free for all up there. Your body doesn’t get enough time to rest. A lot of the work is supposed to be ergo friendly and it’s not. I have permanent damage to my hands now. Take and do what you want with this information. If you’re young and have free time then this is the job for you. But if you’re older with a family and you enjoy your time with them, this isn’t the job for you. All the benefits aren’t worth not being able to pick up your children. "
Tesla,Production Associate,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The benefits are the best part of this job!

What is a typical day like for you at the company?12 hours 3 breaks and water. 6am to 6pm with a 2-hour bus ride each way."
Tesla,Production Associate,4,"Pays well, 10% differential on the night shift. 12 hour shifts which lead to overtime pay every shift and there are opportunities for more overtime. If you want to put your head down and grind hours away this is arguably the best place to do that."
Tesla,Tesla,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Managers are not selected based on experience or work ethic They are too focus on metrics which is causing the department to loose customer retention and loyalty .

Tesla,Service technician,2,I had been a mechanic for 26 year and wanted to work for Tesla. I had no EV experience.  I felt pressured to produce early on. They claimed the first 3 months were training. They didn't follow the training criteria outlined by Tesla. I often got frustrated and struggled. It was very much a dealership environment where the fastest techs got most of the jobs and there was little opertunity to become fast. 
Tesla,Sales Associate,3,Very hard to move forward. Difficult to navigate and very disorganized. No room for upward growth.  Management changes constantly.  Work culture is non existent. They always talk about the good old days.

I moved up from a production associate to a cybertruck repair technician in 8 months. My pay was lower than the normal pay at the time at 21.60 vs the 23.40 lvl 1 techs recieved. On my way to become a technical training instructor, first interview went well. The next day I was promoted to a Lvl 2 technician with my 2nd interview in the coming days.

Coworkers will say hi to you and as soon as you turn around they’ll back stab you for a promotion or to make their supervisor happy. They literally work like animals in this factory. If you applying for PA position don’t expect to encounter smart people working along side you, they are incredibly dumb. The smart people are upstairs.

Tesla,Service Supervisor,1,"If you’re looking for high school drama, here it is.

Tesla,Tesla Advisor,3,The work is fun/entertaining. You get to sell cool cars and it's not that bad. Don't get mentioned too hard on your performance. Regional style management currently is horrendous. Managers are constantly getting fired/hired so getting a promotion is something you really have to work your tail off for. Pay is a lower than what is expected. There is no incentive to sell since it's not commission based.

The human factor adds complexity, especially when dealing with customers. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Many of my daily responsibilities were organized, but a large portion was unscheduled, requiring me to think and find resources that were not always readily available.

The company’s commitment to innovation and sustainability resonates deeply with me, making it a joy to represent the brand.My training was thorough, equipping me with the knowledge needed to assist customers effectively. I appreciate the supportive team environment; colleagues are always willing to lend a hand when things get busy. The focus on collaboration enhances our ability to resolve customer issues quickly and efficiently.One area for improvement is the need for more streamlined processes. Occasionally, I encounter challenges with the software systems we use, which can slow down response times. I believe that enhancing these tools would significantly improve both employee and customer experiences.Despite these minor challenges, the opportunity to engage with passionate customers and help them with their Tesla experiences makes my role fulfilling. I’m excited to continue growing with the company and contributing to its mission."

Tesla,Technicien mobile,1,Mediocre working condition and productivity race. No extra professional activity in order to improve cohesion. No listening or sharing with hierarchical superiors. Performance not necessarily rewarded.
Tesla,Staff Program Manager,3,Priorities and direction would change so quickly that you constantly feel underwater.  Ideas in the company come from the top down and rarely flow the other direction.  Very talented people with tons of potential if guided towards the right goals.  
Tesla,"Material Handler,Repair Tech",4,"Elon takes care of his employees.Benefits from day one that are unbeatable,a lot of room to grow&advance.Overall great company expect some management that are unqualified and throw employees under the bus for personal gain"

Tesla,Tesla Advisor,4,"Working as a Tesla Advisor has been one of the most exhilarating and rewarding experiences of my career. Tesla, a pioneer in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, is not just a company; it’s a revolution in motion. As an Advisor, I’ve had the unique opportunity to be at the forefront of this innovation, guiding customers through their journey with Tesla.1. Impactful Work Environment:From day one, it was clear that Tesla is committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible. The work environment is dynamic, fast-paced, and deeply rooted in a mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. This sense of purpose makes every task feel significant, and it’s incredibly motivating to be part of a team with such a clear and ambitious vision.2. Engaging Customer Interactions:One of the most fulfilling aspects of being a Tesla Advisor is the interaction with customers. Every conversation is an opportunity to educate and inspire. Whether I’m explaining the benefits of Tesla’s advanced autopilot features or helping a customer understand the savings from switching to an EV, it’s gratifying to see the excitement and satisfaction in their eyes. The role demands a thorough understanding of Tesla’s products and services, but the comprehensive training provided ensures that you’re well-equipped to meet these demands.3.

Tesla,Sacker,3,"Time management is an essential skill that can significantly impact productivity and overall well-being. Effectively managing time allows individuals to prioritize tasks, minimize procrastination, and maintain a balanced lifestyle. By creating a structured schedule, people can allocate time to important tasks while leaving room for relaxation and personal activities. One of the key aspects of time management is setting clear goals and breaking them down into manageable steps. This not only helps in achieving larger objectives but also reduces stress by preventing last-minute rushes."

Tesla,Construction Manager,5,"There are always a lot of works to do. What you have to do is to follow Elon Musk and complete your work. If you can colplete your work at Tesla, you will be excellent."
Tesla,Energy System Designer,4,"Good place to work when you are recently graduated since there is no great growth opportunity, yet you learn a lot in the company, everything is almost very clear."
Tesla,Production Associate,5,I look forward coming into work every day doing my stretches and going to the daily meetings.  I love my co workers and the atmosphere.  The hardest part of this job would have to be the long hour's standing in one place.  The most enjoyable part would have to be all the rest! 
Tesla,Fluffer,4,Hired as a fluffer at Tesla. Was required to fluff all employees every hour. So far so good. Making decent money and really enjoy my job. Hoping to get promoted to head fluffer soon.
Tesla,Production Associate,1,It's a corporate sh** show just because everyone thinks it's a good company doesn't mean it is. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone I. Stuck here for a little while longer been here 2 yrs almost and the old saying Is your only as strong as your weakest boss.... there's a reason the turnover rate of employment is higher then other companies 
Tesla,Assembly Line Worker,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Loved to learn about the vehicle as it gets put together.

Tesla,Paint Prepper,4,The cleanest and best layout for any body shop there is. Never had to worry about running out of materials. The people I worked with were like family and easily the best co workers I’ve ever had. 
Tesla,Engineering Process Technician,3,"This is a tough place to work. Not for everybody. Particularly, night shifts still have a higher amount of stress. Minimal amount of training and you have to pick up yourselves.  Overwhelming at times."
Tesla,Supervisor,1,"The team is filled with talented and dedicated individuals, and the work environment offers exciting and complex challenges that foster personal and professional growth. However, there is a significant shortcoming in the form of unclear or inconsistent guidance from the senior executive team within the UK branch. This lack of strategic direction from leadership often leaves employees feeling uncertain about long-term goals and company priorities, which can hinder progress and innovation despite the team’s potential."
Tesla,Data Analyst,2,"Standards are very high with people who dont know the ontology grading you. Most managers are awful and this job was basically high school all over again. You have to suck up to get in, Also no way to move up. It's not real, dont believe them, "
Tesla,Automotive Technician,3,"Fun place to work, it stays very busy most of the time so it keeps you occupied but small shop and feels a little overcrowded but overall a good and fun place to work"
Tesla,Data Annotation Specialist,2,Good resume builder but not a fit for me personally. Perks being it’s a quiet workroom floor when you move past training. There are social aspects if you interact with coworkers during training but it’s a not for everyone gig. I would rather be moving around all day but appreciated a recruiter taking a chance on me. The hiring process is very unique and done completely virtually.
Tesla,Lead Sales Advisor.,2, it’s really unfair when you work harder than all of your coworkers and they decide to promote people they like rather than someone like me who shows results. I sell an average of 60-90 teslas a month and I still got let go. What a joke of a management.
Tesla,Inventory Control Specialist,5,Great place to work at with great benefits. Each department is different to work in. The department I was in had a great team besides my supervisor. There is definitely favoritism and discrimination at times 
Tesla,Vehicle Readiness Specialist,1,"Terrible place to work for anyone with dignity or a life outside of work. Do not start working here if you want to be able to schedule time off, even weeks in advanced."
Tesla,Production Associate level 3,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Respect and wisdom work be on your task What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Nothing stressful about me I did found tell now
Tesla,Material Handler,2,Work 3 days on 4 days off/ 4 days on 3 days offI learned a few things while I was there. Make sure you do your work and not engage in workplace drama.Don't tell your business to anybody there. Management in production would do anything to keep you from progressing and growing with the company. The enjoyable part about them is the work hours and compensation and benefits. 
Tesla,Manufacturing Associate,5,Nice Work and Hours leadership is nice depending who your supervisor is but overall very good time especially when overtime quicks in then you’ll get a good check 
Tesla,Coordinator,2,Tesla gave me PTSD. If you talk to enough ex Tesla they’ll tell you too. It’s a unique place. The pay was meh but the stock made it worth it. Demanding and poor leadership. Bad culture. 
Tesla,Material Handler,3,"It was a good job, worked hard. Showed up one day and was fired along with thousands of others. There was not even a system to it, saw people who worked 5 years let go."
Tesla,Forklift Operator/Material Handler,3,Hardest part of the job is adjusting to the environment. You pick up your fro lift then you drop items on the line. And continue to do this for 12 hours of your day. 
Tesla,Technician,3,Lots of training and fun work environment at times. Sometimes coworkers and managers can be a bummer but if you land at a good stop the day goes by fast
Tesla,Heavy Asset Driver,4,Good place to work. Good Benefits. Good schedule. Made good money. But job security isn’t promised as I was laid off when they cut back 10 percent globally. 
Tesla,Production Associate,4,My overall experience was trying to cooperate with the scale and importance of the business and working within the allocated platforms for a healthy contribution. 
Tesla,Production Associate,1,Honestly Loved working best job Ive had so far Amazing pay lots of opportunities awesome benefits great people to meet But would lay off 4% of the company 
Tesla,Material Handler,3,Tesla is a great company to work for but is also cutthroat in the sense that you can lose your job unexpectedly for no reason. Great pay and benefits with awesome career growth opportunities. 
Tesla,Production Associate,5,"Pay was good, the people were cool but when i wasn’t sick, it felt like that was my home more then my actual home was. Other then that i had a nice time working there till i got injured."
Tesla,"Houston, TX",1,"The only people left are low competency managers and workers coasting until something better comes along. Tesla has demonstrated that they hate smart, competent workers who are paid well. "
Tesla,Production Worker,4,Loved my job the ability to support my family until blindsided by layoffs after 5+ years with the company and a uphill battle to  rehire. The ability to grow is an option with aid and support of your leads.
Tesla,Production Associate,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The benefits are pretty good; other than that would not recommend. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Unless you kiss buttocks constantly your not going to get very far. Office politics is common place and far too many people are way too sensitive. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?They'll work you to the point of exhaustion and then just as quickly cut hours because of over production. Then at the last possible minute let you know that you're working OT. While the pay is decent you're too busy either working or sleeping that you don't have the time to enjoy life. And Gods help you if you have a medical issue because you now have a target on your back and they will find a loop hole and kick you to the curb. And then there's the layoffs. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Cummute for an hour and a half to the plant, spend 12 hours busting your balls, sucking up and basically trying to accomplish the impossible with outdated third hand machines that the hire ups run without allowing time for proper maintenance. Then we get to listen to the production supervisors complain about down time; yet they don't want to hear, or don't care about anything but the numbers. I spent upwards of 16 hours a day away from home for 5 and 6 days a week. Good money but no time to enjoy it."
Tesla,Production Associate,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Free transportation , can listen to music etc What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Switch the schedule whenever they want tooWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Good everybody get alone sometimes What is a typical day like for you at the company?Building cars all they want is us to build cars"
Tesla,Automotive Detailer,2,"Not the job I expected. Seen many red flags from the beginning, but unfortunately ignored them. Getting actually hired took several months, even after getting and accepting the offer. Constant delays in shift availability caused me to switch shifts, in which I was told was a 4 day(10hr shifts) work week day shift. Well, when I started, it was a totally different day shift. I was lied to and was to work a 5 day shift, instead of 4..thats not it. Shift changed SEVERAL times along with the fact there was no proper training or orientation to start. New employees are just thrown out there. Many people there were cool, but like many places it was all about cliques and who was ""friends"" with who. Detail wise..it was a mess.. broken equipment, messy area, no structure or methods to have cars done and done correctly or efficiently. Only 6 car chargers, but they'll complain and ask why you haven't charged the 50 cars you did smh.. I tried the meetings, the talks with managers, coworkers...nothing seemed to change, and when it would ""get better"", it wouldn't last past two weeks. Detailers are the fall guys for other peoples mistakes. You'll be the blamed when an estimator or someone else didnt do their job. You have to do legit details to the cars(they'll say you won't), but they expect them done within minutes. This place also suffered form lazy and non reliable coworkers. People there seem to know who's who work ethic wise, even the supervisors, but like a lot of places your hard work gets rewarded with more work while others sit around or disappear. I've heard them complain about employees, - more..."
Tesla,Sales Advisor,1,"This location, and job is truthfully the worst thing that happened to me. Honestly, the only thing positive that came out of it is the fact that I now have “Tesla” on my resume, which prospective employers care to see.This company is filthy. They are so wrapped up in their own heads that they promote the worst type of behavior. I’m not necessarily sure what I can write here, but the headlines about what happens at these jobs is true- it happened to me, and it might happen to you. And the management here did nothing to stop it, and they actively tried to push me away.You will sell millions of dollars worth of their product, which you get no commission for, you will deliver their cars (most of the time with no knowledge because their training is awful), you get stock that only goes down, and you’ll be surrounded by people and customers that are so one minded that if you do anything wrong- you become a target.If you get this job, genuinely be careful, watch what you say, because they watch you. But the moment you watch them- it’ll be over."
Tesla,Mobile Service Technician,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?The products are cutting edge and excellent to work onWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Poor management. Little or no perks for working for a tesla. No bonuses. Keep changing the working hours and patterns. Like working for a petulant toddlerWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Managed by anybody other than experienced motor trade individuals, and as such have little or no idea about how to run a retail car workshop business. This creates devision in the workplace and forms clicky us/them groups What is a typical day like for you at the company?No real typical days as processes and systems constantly change and mostly for no reason or practical gain. Which has an impact on the customers"
Tesla,Tesla Certified Technician,4,"Loved working here! Gave Tesla 2.5 years of great work, and commitment. Then got canned without a single issue on my record. Good place to learn, while walking on egg shells to keep your job"

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work environment can be stressful and your not really allowed to voice any negative opinions. What is a typical day like for you at the company?I don't work there anymore, I was laid off"
Tesla,Warehouse Associate,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Room for flexibility, travel accommodations to and from work, competitive pay, OT available, benefits from day 1, many incentivesWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?the length of the shift and navigating the factoryWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?work environment is manageable, and culture is diversifiedWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?typical day is much like many other warehouse workspaces"
Tesla,Service Technician,3,"Great place to work at first. But they will fire you if you experience a loss in your family. No understanding for basic human events. I lost my fiance and needed time off to grieve, I was fired when I returned a week later from approved bereavement leave. "
Tesla,Engineer,3,Working environment is good and you can work with many smart people with great passion in engineering. The con side is not much transparency in management level and you get lower than market pay
Tesla,Production Associate,3,"Alot of people see it as a place to be social, but if you keep your head down and do your job, you should be fine. Its long hours ( 12 hours) but  itll be worth it once you see the check."
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Sales Representative,3,"Physically hard , Working as a sales representative for PepsiCo offers dynamic opportunities in merchandising, driven by a renowned brand with global impact."
PepsiCo Beverages North America,ayudante general,5,"Very good employment, with good performance and excellent work environment to develop position skills and development in the company, do not pass the opportunity to belong to the family"
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Loader,3,"Just long hours, super physically and mentally demanding. But if you like hard physical work this is for you. My main thing is the management though. Yknow, the typical favoritism, and the miscommunication, all of that stuff."
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Loader,3,Expect to work a lot of hours. Management is a joke. One of the most disorganized places I’ve ever worked for. Great pay and free healthcare are like the only pros
PepsiCo Beverages North America,MIS Executive,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Good culture and working style also help full bossWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Nothing like this. Some time late let night work in closing What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Environment and culture is goodWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Focus on the campany growth.
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Geo Box Driver,2,"If you are willing to sacrifice your physical and mental health for six figures then this might be the job for you. Geobox driver will be working 12-14 hours a day. Half the tractors have no ac. All guys that have been working there 10+ years limp to their tractor from work related injuries. Equipment is faulty and not fixed in a timely manner. When you are new and you have questions when you are on your own expect to wait a few hours for a manager to get back to you. Employees of the DS stores expect you to stock shelves when a 1/3 case can go up, however managers only expect you to fill when there’s a hole. So they also expect you to be a manager and tell store employees what level of work is expected instead of Pepsi communicating. Very little communication between any positions of authority. No accountability when it comes to managers or sales reps, only drivers. They will most likely deny your work related injury claims. "
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Merchandiser,4,The work is quite demanding but it's easy. Good job for student who wants to make extra money during their studies. Would not recommend for full time job
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Warehouse Worker,3,"Long hours and a lot of stress. Work hours were 3 p.m. until work completed. Product was often in wrong locations which led to higher pick times, which could result in a coaching. "
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Accounts Payable Analyst,4,"It is a place with a very good work environment, but you have to touch you a good manager to see growth, if not, you will feel stagnant professionally and personally."
PepsiCo Beverages North America,District Manager,3,I have great benefits. There's a lot of favortism and unrealistic expectaions. It's impossible to hit plan. It's a very stressful job and the pay should be much higher.
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Order Picker,1,"This place has workers degrading each other and racing for the top spot without an actual promotion or compensation to reward hard work. No opportunities to move up fast like promised, lied to about hours that will be worked. Ex: manager ""3pm to 10pm"" actual shift (2pm to 7am). Unreal work commitment, unclean place , no promotions, workers degrading, fighting each other, expecting high work pace and extreme rates of packing and loading shipments, back breaking hard labor without proper compensation, poor management, they have a lot of favoritism, forced to work on holidays, made mandatory or written up or penalized for not working. "
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Operador Multifuncional III,3,"What is the best part of working in the company? Salary and benefits and work environment is the most stressful part of the work in the company? Incompetent leadership without doubt how are the environment and the work culture in the company? Very good.However, management question is terrible"
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Shipping Clerk,3,"The atmosphere was great the employees were super friendly and helpful but the lack on training for my  position was the biggest issue.  The company was using a new system and everyone was struggling to master it. loved my job but never felt confident in my position. The managers assured me it was a challenging process and it gets better. The job was great until it wasn’t. I will cherish the experience learned a lot, but would rather know how to do my job completely rather than guess how to do it. "
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Fleet Mechanic,4,"Overall it's a great place to work, good pay good benefits and everyone acts as a team in my location. Management has your back and understands if something breaks."
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Warehouse Loader,5,Excellent pay with great hardworking team. You get what you earned. Free lunch on ur first day and team race for free case every week. Managements really take good care of their employees by providing free drinks everyday to avoid dehydration. Best place to work.
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Merchandiser,4,"I usually started at 5am, stocking different stores or chasing our delivery trucks. I put over 11,000 miles on my car in two months . It takes a lot of strength and you can’t be sensitive."
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Merchandiser,4,"You start work before the sun is up, but you get out early. Is hard work, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes routine. Is a good workout too. "
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Relief Driver,5,Relief was a difficult thing due to routes being random.  The other is scheduling of delivering in different time zones made it difficult at times.  Also dollar general was very time consuming.
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Driver,5,"You have to take the good with the bad, excellent pay and good benefits. I enjoyed meeting new customers and learning new skills I would definitely recommend to anyone "

PepsiCo Beverages North America,Sales Representative,3,"Physically hard , Working as a sales representative for PepsiCo offers dynamic opportunities in merchandising, driven by a renowned brand with global impact."
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Merchandiser,2,"This used to be a good company to work for but has only gone downhill the last 5 years. Management are often replaced with college hires that don't have experience in the business. Pay is decent but should be higher when competitor companies pay the same for less work.The work itself has gotten worse since picking up Gatorade. It's a physical job so be prepared to throw soda and gatorade all day. Expect long days in the summer/holidays and expect to be pressured to cut corners during slow seasons to meet hour cuts. Turnover is high. When you're finished with your day early you get sent to help other people. Needy stores that each expect to be serviced first. Bad sales reps that order too much product and order light all week then slam in the product for the merchandisers.I will say it is fairly easy to get promoted to Sales rep since that position also has high turnover but I've done that too and it's honestly better to be a merch. Less stress, less headache. Your life belongs to pepsi as a rep but as a merch you can mostly leave your work at work.Best part of the job was interacting with store workers and other vendors. "
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Transport Driver,5,"PepsiCo has been nothing but good to me . Transporting fountain and cooler equipment all across New England . Union pay, great benefits . Only down side no 401k match"
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Merchandiser,4,"Great people, requires hard work ethic and an early check in. The management takes care of you but you have a lot of stores that you have to take care of in one day"
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Production Worker,2,"The work is easy if the machines are working witch are usually down they have no money for repairs. They like to micro manage and write people up once the busy season comes to an end. Supervisors talk down to you if your machine is down. Most of the time its  the broken down machine, sometimes poor training but they still talk down to you. No appreciation at all evan during employee appreciation week.Do not work for them."
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Manager Assistant,4,Extremely good learning experience... Caring management and colleagues were always supportive. Good benefits and health benefits. Growth opportunity was also good.
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Warehouse Worker,4,It’s a very busy place. Long shifts and nobody cares about you. You have to be mindful of what you’re going to be doing because you’ll be working all night long. They will keep you there till 7am from 6pm the night before 
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Bulk Merchandiser,1,I do not recommend this company. I’ve been there for years now and the pay is terrible. You have to work 6 to 7 days a week for your check to be less of a joke. Senior management complain a lot but are never out in the field working. Single parent having to work 2 jobs to barely make ends meet

Constantly being forced.
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Senior Product Designer,1,"What is the best thing to work in the company? Very good initiatives are carried out at the social level and that was very enriching as a person and worker.What is the most stressful of working in the company? The workload was high and in my case I had the feeling that everything he did was looked in detail.Micromanagement.The schedules did not allow a good conciliation and in summer the intensive day was non -existent for workers who carried projects in the US, with a clear philosophy.However, I have witnessed little ethical behaviors by people with great influence, which made me reflect on how they really interpret and apply business culture. In your case, how is a typical day in the company? Well in general the morningsThey were to work and focus on the tasks that you should share during the afternoon with the different teams of USA and India."
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Merchandiser,4,You're gonna work long hours the pay is decent at $22 hr starting. You will drive your personal car. It's nice that as long as you do your job the bosses won't be on your back

PepsiCo Beverages North America,Warehouse Worker,1,Management presents job as an easy going but once you get hired it’s back breaking work. Management could care less about you long as your working to make them look good is all they care about. Your also on a point system so it doesn’t matter if your on you death bed they will point you for calling out and you get no sick days. They watch your every move and expect you to over pick every day if you don’t you’ll be threaten about losing your job. The amount of work you do does not match your pay. Breaks are also short and you will be scored so you can’t be a minute over your 15 min break and 30 min lunch. Don’t recommend this job long term 
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Account Merchandiser,2,"Starts off as a pretty solid and good job to keep around but once you begin to put your 100%, management puts unrealistic expectations on you and begins to push you to work long hours, then scold you for working long hours, they'll push you to work overtime, then scold you for working overtime. There are days where you'll begin at on store in Phoenix, then they'll pull you from your route and have you drive up 1 hour to Carefree, then back down a 1 hour drive to Queen Creek, then back up a 30 minute drive to Scottsdale and expect you to finish fast. Communication from management is terrible and they often never know who is where and who is on the clock and available. Management plays favorites a lot and will not accommodate anyone they dont like."
PepsiCo Beverages North America,Pepsi Employee,1,"The morale company wide has tanked over the past year. Upper management is horrible. They don't try to fix ""broken"" procedures - they prefer to  belittle the teams & say just get it done. Some nice people work here, but they are quitting because it's so toxic. They do not value their employees at all. The employee appreciation week was a joke. Several activities were community outreach projects (filling backpacks & food donations).  I support those programs 100% ... but don't make it part of the employee appreciation week. At Christmas corporate only sent an email on Christmas Eve wishing you Merry Xmas, but couldn't read it because it was in Spanish. The facility is very old and needs major repairs. Training is horrible across all departments, but they still expect you to know things even if you've never done it before. Very toxic environment which is why morale is so low. I tried but I just can't do it anymore and I start a new job next week. Do yourself a favor and do not come to work at this location - you will regret it. "

PepsiCo Beverages North America,Merchandiser,3,"My time here, if you work at a pace that is not sustainable and work fast for the sake of making boss happy, they will expect you to work at that pace, quick money if motivated in the moment but it irked me that a new hire that would do 1/10 the work I’d do got paid the same amount and treated the same way as me. Might as well work for a union, as I worked for both coke and Pepsi, good job if you live near HQ in Everett. But shifts get to 11-14 hours sometimes. That’s why when I say you can spend an extra hour making the store happy to get more hours for yourself and make it reasonable, then if you don’t consistently do that they will think you are slacking."

PepsiCo Beverages North America,Pepsi,5,"The agencies also make mistakes, we missed all the time.But if you manage an internal creative department like Pepsi, you really need to question your own approach and ensure that it is not limited by its own brand.It is clear that Pepsi didn't do that. ”Nairn adds:“ It's basic common sense that if you are surrounded by people who live and breathe your brand when creating an ad, so you are much more likely to disasters than working with an agencyAdvertising, which will adopt a more balanced approach. “Yes, an agency will take more time to make an ad, but a longer attempt and error approach usually avoid controversy, so it's worth it.”This is linked to which of the 7 dimensions of reptrak, being financial performance, citizenship, governance, workplace, leadership, innovation and products and services?"

ADM,Electrician,1,I wouldn’t recommend ADM for any trades looking for work. You work minimum 6 days a week and the wages are low compared to anywhere else in the province. Maintenance manager is great but the senior leadership are micromanaging every detail and show a large lack of respect for maintenance trades. This place is just ancient obsolete equipment. I worked a year here and I have seen it getting even worse than when I started. Don’t waste your time.

ADM,Process Operator,3,It was a very repetitive job and the swing shift got old very quickly. Their training program is extremely unprofessional and unorganized. It was difficult to advance in your role due to training restrictions.
ADM,Production Specialist,1,"My experience at ADM only lasted a month and in that month having patience for me lasted not even a week. I came in there with a hard working attitude and was more than willing to work hard for them. When you are a person like me who is smart but has High-Functioning Autism Spectrum disorder, you won't last. The management as well as other employees will have no patience for you. They gave me a month and as time went on I was getting better but the effort I put in was never enough. Only one or two people understood why or even cared. I was even insulted and called r*tarded by one of them who works in the Probe Stand. Just because that person had no patience for me. So before you  apply I would ask yourself, is it worth it if you are a bit slower? Because they poorly explain and train you and expect you to know the job like a professional within a couple days."

Union is horrible.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Shift length is not bad but they will bounce you around shifts like a rubber ball.
ADM,Grain Elevator Operator,4,The management at the Creve Couer AMD is second to none. The workers there are top notch and are more than willing to walk you through everything about the job. It’s a great place to learn and to grow professionally.

ADM,Matinence,1,"Everything is constantly breaking down, the company would rather worry about production then take the time to fix and maintain the plant appropriately. This place is a living nightmare. But it pays the bills. (Barely)"
ADM,Maintenance Supervisor ,3,"Great benefits, good pay. It wasn't inside the plant so I didn't have as many corporate bosses around. I liked my job, my location was condemned.  I was told for months my job was safe, but then one day the superintendent walked in and let me go."
ADM,Operator 1,4,Good pay plenty of overtime good management if you like working a lot this place is for you and the benefits are decent and if you like making overtime money it's very easy to.
ADM,Grunt worker,1,"Get up early,30 minutes later you’re covered in sweat,dust and sloop from the pits and the tunnels,also try to work around the occasional rat.Low air levels.Badly maintained. The guys aren’t too bad to work with. The work doesn’t match the pay."
ADM,Operator,5,Hard work will get dirty and stink but good pay. Management is adequate if working night shift team lead is the person to really go to not for the weak a lot of lifting and carrying.
ADM,General Laborer,5,I worked for ADM for 12 years and really enjoyed my work there.  Its a great place to work and the benefits are very good.  The hours can be long during harvest but the rest of the time is easy.  Plenty of time to get caught up on work assignments.
ADM,Relief operator/utility,5,You never know what you will come into at night time I think that’s the best part for me because I was busy right when I get there and most cases there was an opportunity to learn something new that’s what I like the most 
ADM,Truck Driver Class A,1,"Work is easy , mgmt is non existent.. Favortism and mgr tals to you like a child, they are always right and never wrong and you are always wrong and never right !!!"
ADM,Operator,1,"Only care about production, nothing else matters.   Personnel safety is a joke.  Only way they know how to solve operational/maintenance problems is to throw money at it.  Never think problems through.  "
ADM,Financial Analyst,2,"This is such a bizarre company to work for...in my department no one seems to have any big picture understanding of the company or how our work relates to it...people constantly spout sentences filled with acronyms that they have no explanation for when asked. Also very little comradery among coworkers at adm which I value as extremely important. Due to previous outsourcing at the company, they constantly have team building activities that seem fake and no nothing to build a team...probably due to the fact that people r expecting their jobs to be outsourced next.  I would not recommend working here to even my worst enemy"
ADM,Mill Operator,3,Hot and nasty place to work. Great pay. Supervisors are lazy and a bunch of hard donkeys .Over all not a bad job. Bunch of climbing stairs and checking on equipment. Stuff likes to jam or choke up. Very humid wet and dusty environment lifting up to 100lbs

ADM,Plant Utility,3,Loved working here. I learned something new every day and it was fun doing so. Unfortunately my time here came to an abrupt end when I took a mental health day and was promptly fired the very next day.
ADM,Account Manager,4,Pretty solid benefits. 6% 401k match with 3 weeks of vacation starting out. Laid back environment with decent chance of moving up. They don't fire anyone it seems so don't worry about working too hard. 
ADM,QA Technician,2,"Some coworkers were really good but management needs to change asap!! There is A LOT of favoritism and it shows! also, they treat the hispanic workers different from the american ones which is not fair considering that more than half the company is hispanic. Met some great people, wouldn't work there again"
ADM,"Joplin, MO",1,"You’d have better luck finding competency elsewhere. Working there was ultimately my worst working experience. A majority of management could be replaced by snakes and nothing would change. The loaders and cleaning staff were cool, as were lab workers. Everybody else was basically a middle schooler trapped in the body of an adult. "
ADM,Performance Excellence Practitioner,4,There are some strong areas with great leaders but there are equally areas with poor leaders.   Benefits and pay are excellent for managers.  The biggest downfall is that the organization is made of a lot of silos.  Each group is working for themselves with little collaboration across divisions.
ADM,Laborer,1,"Horrible work associates and upper manager, overall bad communication , the company sees most new employees as replaceable,they give little to know effort to improve "
ADM,Senior Legal Counsel,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?The people were terrific to work with and the company provided significant opportunities for advancement.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Substantial volume of work with short timelines.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is professional, but aggressive.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work requests are received throughout the day with verying degrees of complexity or time constraints."
ADM,Deckhand,2,Don’t go to Artco if you’re from another company. They don’t let you have a day off unless you use sick time or vacation days and they treat you like you’re green and the rumors are true. Artco deckhands don’t know much about decking. 
ADM,Operator,1,"Not great, not terrible. Upper management is awful and aloof but local management seems to care at least a lil bit. Recommend working here if you need money"
ADM,Supervisor,2,"Have not enjoyed time working here. Company is run well, but local plant is not. Benefits are aweful, pay can be good if you fight for your pay up front."
ADM,Operator One,3,What is the best part of working at the company?The work is not that hard and the pay is great What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Swing shift one week you're on third one week you're on seconds in one week you are on first no time for your children if you have small childrenWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?It is Multicultural and the environment is okay you learn to take the good with the badWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Loading trucks and rail cars as well as washing rail cars getting samples and ceiling the real cars up to be shipped out
ADM,Operations Manager,5,"Great first job out off college, they tend to use and abuse new hire managers, like working night shift shoveling rotten corn out of rail cars etc. 24 hours on call most of the time after that. The job was stable for awhile but heavily dependent on global grain prices. If there is a bad year there is a lottery system for lay offs. I made it 6 years before the lottery system pulled my number. "
ADM,Utility,3,good job if your looking for hours to make money but like with any plant you will always be on call for over time so some times it feels like you live there. overall solid place to make some money 
ADM,Analista de Processos Sênior,2,"Organizational climate Very Bombons Benefits.Management needs to be more senior, a very inexperienced team. It has a restaurant in the company and good food."
ADM,Mechanic,3,Good co-workers. Bad environment. Constant wear and tear on your body. The work is okay but I don’t like working 16 hour shifts and it happens out of no where. Honestly if you love to work your life away for a factory it’s the place for you.
ADM,Machine Operator,3,They bought it Deerland and ruined it. The company is good to work for in it's self but management is awful. Everyone and I mean everyone is looking for other work because they never have enough employees and they still want the work done. The insurance sucks. The pay also sucks. That's the main reason why people are always leaving plus you feel like you're taken advantage of. 
ADM,Operador de Produção I,3,Pleasant company to work ... but there is exclusion and racism .. indirect
ADM,Operator,2,"Management will do anything in their power to prevent anyone they aren't friends with to grow their career, they will also belittle and call employees below them stupid.  The pay is decent but you will always work a rotating 12 hour shift and get blamed for managements mistakes and incompetence.  The superintendent will also tell you your easily replaceable and to quit if you don't like something. But just remember we're a family here. "
ADM,Production Worker,2,"ADM was one of the higher paying jobs in valdosta at one point. That is no longer the case, needs people that want to do a better job communicating with workers and actually trying to connect with team members. "
ADM,Site Operative,3,"4 on 4 off shift pattern, with plenty of available overtime means you can earn well above starting salary. Role mainly covers different areas of operation for out of normal business hours."
ADM,Manager,3,The company struggles with poor strategic direction and a lack of alignment. Communication up and down the management change is poor.. Benefits are generally good. Culture of focus on how much it costs with not as much regard for people. Work hours can be long. Hardest part of the job is managing expectations of levels above. Pay is all over the map.
ADM,NA,5,Can work lots of hours and lots of overtime available. Benefits are really good. Management team is always there and willing to help. The overtime is good but requires you to work all shifts.
ADM,Inventarios,5,"What is the best thing to work in the company? Everything, salary and environmentThe company? Inclusive, accurate and safe .. How is a typical day for you in the company? ..............................."
ADM,Utility Operator,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits if you can even get a day off to utilize them.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management. Nepotism and favoritism. A Lot of affairs and quid quo pro type of transactions.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic. Most employees who work there are only there for a quick check. They do not care... And the employees that care are often overlooked and mistreated What is a typical day like for you at the company?Easy work but management does not care about compliance just numbers in production.
ADM,Cleaner,1,"The worst experience ever was working at a place that felt like a daycare. Everyone seemed to want to fight, argue, and talk negatively. Despite putting in a lot of effort, I ended up with a broken face in the hospital, almost losing my life. I rushed back to work before fully healing because I didn’t want to lose my job. Unfortunately, I was fired due to medical absences. I definitely wouldn’t recommend that place to anyone!"
ADM,Director of Operations,4,Great people staff and facilities nice cafeteria and fantastic benefits love meeting new people and staff I would recommend it to all to work there for you 
ADM,Packer,1,I worked here for 8 months. The coworkers and supervisors are very rude. Super strict for no reason. Temp workers only make 14 dollars an hour. I’ve had coworkers say rude things to me and management does not care about its employees. WON’T RECOMMEND
ADM,Senior Legal Counsel,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?The people were terrific to work with and the company provided significant opportunities for advancement.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Substantial volume of work with short timelines.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is professional, but aggressive.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work requests are received throughout the day with verying degrees of complexity or time constraints."
ADM,Miller,1,"A typical day is being overworked everyday working 2 weeks straight to have one day off to turn around and do it all over again. Don’t say you’re overworked and stressed out and need a weekend off and take a weekend off because you just get written up for it. Prepare to work twice as much and twice as hard as the managers due to them getting their weekends off no matter what. If you have problems or issues with equipment good luck getting answers from management even if they manage to answer no matter what the problem is or how serious it may be you’re told “it should be fine” and “ keep running we will look at it when we get there in the morning. “ for example a hot bearing on a rollstand that maintenance came and looked at due to it running a high temperature, maintenance instructed me to shut down if the case to the bearing reached 179 degrees which it did, I shut the system down called management and was told it should be fine and to continue production. No care for employees or their safety some employees still can’t access safety equipment from vending machine and management has been notified multiple times and still can’t access basic PPE such as gloves, earplugs and safety glasses. This company fools you with the pay because it’s not even close to worth it better off at any other plant then ADM they at least have a structure where you get days off"
ADM,Miller,1,Production is a priority! Your mental well being isn't.  Communication is nonexistent! If you want to know if you work this weekend wait until Friday & good luck getting the day off if you had something planned. So if you don't value your time & just need a paycheck not a bad place. Insurance sucks. If you have a safety issue or concerns just go talk to a wall at least you will keep some of your dignity.
ADM,Merchandiser,4,Workloads don't exceed limits. Trainings could be better. Overall understanding management when things get tough. HR could use some work. Takes forever to figure out and manage benefits. 
ADM,Encarregado Administrativo Operacional,5,"What is the best part of working in the company? A lot of learning and great benefits, some friends. What is the most stressful part of work in the company? Indirect managers are very unable to assume such a function.They do not know and do not want to learn what actually is their function leaving the employee below him overloaded what the environment and the work culture in the company are like? Need to improve a lot in practice.Because in theory is very fluent. How is a typical day for you in the company?Commitment and loyalty to perform tasks."
ADM,Lead Operator,1,It's very demanding both physically and mentally. Extremely hot and dirty work. And during COVID no compensation for the danger we had to work regardless. The managers are horrible I dislike this company very much 
ADM,Coverter operator,2,Seems like there is always a shift doing more than another but the ones who do most work get treated unfairly. While they play favoritism with the employees which they are fond with.
ADM,Bulk Loader,4,Competitive pay in small town makes it hard to find a good reason to leave. Slow work flow in spring and summer can make those days feel real long. Good benefits 
ADM,Operador de tombador,5,"The company is top, works quietly without running, and is well regarded by superiors"
ADM,Agronomist ,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Terrible company, management doesn’t even understand the roles they supervise. It’s a company full of dreamers not doers from top to bottom. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with incompetent co-workers"
ADM,Machine Operator,1,"Job is hot, loud and mundane. Rather slow paced and gets tedious with the long hours. Management doesn't really do much here and there are several people who don't do much work."
ADM,Dock Worker,5,Hard working job but if you stick around and work you will be compensated for it. My boss made the job.  If you get a good group of coworkers its not bad at all. 
ADM,Engineer,4,"Great first job for exposure to plant operations and project management. Culture varies widely based on plant, but in my experience colleagues were all helpful and they were the best part of the job. "
ADM,Inventory control,5,"Great benefits, good team work, weekends off, good training, easy to get along with everyone at work, having the option to work overtime if you would like to."
ADM,Maintenance Worker,2,"Fast paced, you don't trust anyone! Work place culture, daily backstabbing, people wanting to move up by sucking up to those who have no business being in a supervisory role! The hardest part, not knowing your fate on a daily basis, all rules don't apply the same to everyone."
ADM,Operations Manager,1,This place has little to no concern/respect for their employees.  This is a toxic and good  old boy culture and environment.  Look behind the curtain.
ADM,Maintenance Technician,1,Typical day of getting blamed for boss not having repair items inventoried. Union Maintenance dept being thrown in the mud for failures of salaried supervisor position. Tensions between union and ADM staff. Segregation entirely from offices to parking lots between the peasant union members and the first class salaried staff. Very disgusting workplace environment.
ADM,Plant Utility,1,"12 hours of dealing with operators that don't want to teach you anything. You'll self teach a lot.Management is professionalCulture here is horrendous, all from other operators in training able to not do their work (which falls onto you), harass you and get away with it; to operators being on their phones, watching the game during work hours, and gossip about you behind your back constantly. Operators tend to not tell you what's going on and then gets frustrated when something goes wrong. Hardest part of the job is definitely learning the plant. Most enjoyable part is learning new things ."
ADM,Accounting Analyst,3,"The pay and benefits are great but if you have a question about their antiquated systems, on how to do something, or just curious how something is done more often than not you won’t get answered or it’ll take forever to get an answer. But more often than not you get passed around until you give up and just wait to see if someone will answer you. Was the worst culture to work in and network. "
ADM,Feed loader,4,It was an ok job .management  wasn't too bad . Being a machine operator  wasn't to hard to lean easiest job was feed loader once you know what your doing
ADM,Senior Business Communications Specialist,1,They're super old school and the CEO doesn't allow any business practices that don't resembled the 1960's. They don't train their staff and expect those they hire to come in and be able to perform their role without any help or supervision. They'll give you good performance reviews and fire you with 0 notice. Saw this happen to a few people in my time there.
ADM,Senior Legal Counsel,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?The people were terrific to work with and the company provided significant opportunities for advancement.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Substantial volume of work with short timelines.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is professional, but aggressive.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work requests are received throughout the day with verying degrees of complexity or time constraints."
ADM,Operator/Forklift Driver,1,Horrible environment to work in hours are long with no idea at some plants when your day will be because of production schedule. Nepotism abounds with friends and family being hired not a friendly work place
ADM,tecnico en mantenimiento,1,"There is no salary increase, there is no motivation to the employee, lack of tools and spare parts, little personnel not there growth, lack of safety tools (footwear)"
ADM,Operator 1,2,The managers don’t care about you. They will pick on you and find reason to fire you. The Quincy locations are under an umbrella of corporate protection. Many foul practices. 
ADM,Lab Technician,3,"Top pay and benefits.  With the turnover, overtime can get overwhelming at times.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the automacy you get.  Attention to detail is necessary to be successful in this position."
ADM,Manager,1,"Antiquated management and systemsOld school HR policies such as no WFH and below-market benefits Below market salaries and poor pay increment, basically a retirement homeOutdated systems that no one is motivated to upgrade as they do the bare minimum Expats get double the pay of locals and are part of management’s inner circle"
ADM,Pretreat - General laborer ,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?It's an opportunity to meet and work with many awesome people.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?To me, I don't see any stress about the job because it's give time for a breaks What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It is a family oriented business- friendly enviroment- possibility of advancementWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Mostly is to clean and dust some machineries"
ADM,Analyst-Corn Processing,1,What is the best part of working at the company?ADM offered good pay and decent benefitsWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?They seemed to make the job more stressful than it needed to be. Working first Saturday of the month just to be able to get things done in the allotted time frame for accounting close periodWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?The culture was good until Archer Daniels and Midland hired CEO for millions while not giving raises to employees who had been there for yearsWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?I would like to point out no sick days were allowed. I even had to take a vacation days to go see a doctor or dentist
ADM,TRADE MARKETING,2,What is the best thing to work in the company? Reputation and name of the company worldHow is the environment and the work culture in the company? Is regular by not having support for the parent company in many processes. How is a typical day for you in the company? Assume responsibilities and structure processes totally from scratch.
ADM,Operator,2,"Short if any breaks,Learn on your own, very little assistance from trainers,2 weeks days, 2 weeks nightsTeam members and management pick on new guys,No help from management or hr when actual problems occur (men fighting, harassment etc)Great pay, Rough work."
ADM,Alcohol operator,1,"There is no work life balance, constant forced overtime, it’s union versus company and at the end of the day all the union workers are replaceable. If you die your job bid will be put up the very next day. The union insurance is amazing and the pay is great. 1/2 the management really doesn’t care about your safety and it’s grind grind grind ahead of everything else . 100% don’t recommend if you want to maintain a relationship with your family. You can easily pull 120k a year with the forced overtime if you don’t mind being at work more than home"
ADM,Operator,4,The pay is good however over the years corporate seem to not care who or how  the operations are ran. Its very scary nowadays. Swing shifts are not pleasant if your looking for straight shifts RUN. Not the place for you. Your pay can go up very quick depending on what you want to do.
ADM,Director Comercial,2,"It is the typical culture in which each of the areas is responsible only for themselves and the fault of everything to the others.There is no head leadership, the matrix structure generates very harmful internal competition."
ADM,Driver,3,Not a bad company it’s just certain aspects of it is frustrating. The communication of information to help you do your job is lacking and you have to hunt down the correct info.
ADM,Ejecutivo de Cuenta,2,"Excellent benefits and good salary vs. Heavy Labor Environment Market, excess work, lousy in internal processes and disorganization"
ADM,Técnico em segurança do trabalho sênior,5,"Corporate environment for learning performance, rugged EHS culture in everyday life, environment with high flow of operational demands."
ADM,Forklift Operator,2,"Supervision is not professional, they don't let you know your appreciated or that your doing a good job.  They pick and  choose who they wanna talk too. Rather than having meaningful conversations with all employees.  They will tell you one thing and not follow up with you.Benefits are good. Pay is also good. Just supervision could be a little more professional. "
ADM,Manager,4,Good pay decent benefits long hours and work life balance is not the best. Do your job and be available and you will do well. Inconsistent accountability.
ADM,Operator,4,good pay bad management was not a fan of the swings as they didn’t keep the patterns correctly  would constantly switch which day i was making it hairs to schedule things outside of work
ADM,operador 3,5,A great work environment where respect is part of the company's culture.
ADM,Production Operator,1,"Pay is good, benifits good. Completely awful and toxic work environment for all hourly employees. Double, sometimes triple standards for salary. Management has a huge nepotism and favoritism issue regardless of your knowledge of the plants and  operations equipment.  Don’t waste your time!"
Fannie Mae,Operations Engineering Associate,5,"Signing bonuses, yearly bonuses, AND yearly raises are given, no matter the position. I am very much encouraged to take time off, and will even get reprimanded if I respond to emails while on vacation. I have support from all angles and levels of management, and they make me feel validated and important enough to where I can always speak up in the prescience of upper management in meetings.I really cannot complain about even a single aspect. They care about their employees’ well being and even let us decide whether we want to be completely remote (and even work from anywhere in the country) or come in any days. "
Fannie Mae,Associate,2,"Pros: Pretty much what everyone says is great about Fannie Mae including flexible work, salary, and benefits.Cons: Depending on what team you're applying for, there can be a lot of stress and politics. My department went through multiple restructures and that led me to have multiple managers. A majority of my managers told me that they cared about my career growth, but in reality, they never were advocates for me.  People don't have the ability to communicate and often work in silos within their division. You will often get reprimanded for doing your job. I got frustrated over the fact that my managers wouldn't provide any opportunity for me to progress in my career and solely focused on what matters the most - divisional goals. I honestly got stressed every single time I woke up for work. My direct manager would often find fault on my work without a reasonable explanation and single me out. All in all, my career at Fannie Mae was a disappointment. I regret working here."
Fannie Mae,Engineer IV Portfolio/Domain Architect,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Learning environment and great peopleWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Bureaucracy  and managerial politicsWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Supportive, friendly, low pressureWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Design strategy, operational issues, project tasks"
Fannie Mae,"Manager, Finance",3,"Pros: work remote, good salary, good benefits, flex fridays, easy to take sick days Cons: sometimes the culture seems laid back but it really isnt. There is so much unnecessary politics. Took me forever to get promoted then felt like i was treated way worse after getting promoted. The salary increase was not worth the stress increase, i left.  Teams would not share information making it impossible to do your job, but then you would get yelled at for not doing your job. A tone at the top mentality with some teams being arrogant and knowing they can get away with not doing their work and constantly delaying. People have an inability to accept blame. Claim layoffs on teams due to budget which was clear a lie - as they immediately rehired. Low morale as certain teams are held to unfair higher standards. I would lay awake anxious about meetings the next day because of the horrible personality types. I even started to engage in talking badly with other people about teams that refused to do their work - which made me feel guilty - but we were all frustrated from being blamed for not being good at our job despite people withholding the info we needed.  This job made me more stressed, anxious, lose sleep, depressed etc which is not worth the paycheck. I even started to get an attitude on calls because i was defeated. Had to be in weekly therapy for stress and anxiety.  I can visibly see in my face this job aged me.  "
Fannie Mae,Data Entry Operator,5,"I have definitely learned that Fannie Mae has a caring and understanding team, that I love working with. They make you feel like a real family. If they had room for me a full time position I would definitely take the offer."
Fannie Mae,"Reston, VA",1,"My experience at Fannie Mae was overwhelmingly negative, marked by a highly stressful and anxiety-inducing work environment. The atmosphere was riddled with excessive political intrigue, which overshadowed the actual work and made it difficult to focus on achieving meaningful results. The constant maneuvering and backstabbing created a toxic culture that was detrimental to both mental health and professional growth. Overall, my time at Fannie Mae was a deeply frustrating and disappointing chapter in my career."
Fannie Mae,Administrative Assistant,4,No organization is perfect but I’ve been working here for years and I have to say the benefits and people kept me here. I have had a great experience with senior leadership and navigating our hybrid work environment.
Fannie Mae,Closing Specialist,4,"love the flexible work schedule from home and in the office, pretty much work independently, allowed to make a lot of decision on your own.  Good benefits "
Fannie Mae,Financial Engineer,1,"Very political, fraternity-like culture. You’re either “in” or you’re “out”. This is especially the case in the SF finance division. Weak leadership at the director and VP level. Terrible work environment for your mental health. Pay sucks"
Fannie Mae,Operations Management - Senior Associate,4,Fannie Mae is a workplace that will provide you with great benefits and compensation along with a flurry of challenges to both improve your understanding of the housing market and field as well as demonstrate how what you do benefits the company. Your standard work days can go from business as usual to a constant fight to prioritize tasks and meet needs.
Fannie Mae,Sr. Director,4,"Good company to work for: many interesting and important topics to work on; people are professional and high quality; caring culture. Reasonable pay and stable employment. As a big company your experience is much dependent on your line manager and the small work environment.  No major complains. WFH and flexible Friday afternoon is definitely a big plus. As a working mom, I would cut pay and extend working hours for this benefit. I don’t mind working 2 more hours after my kids go sleeping, but WFH makes it possible for me to send my kids to and pick them up from school bus. "
Fannie Mae,Sr. Big Data Engineer,1,very deceptive management style the manager's only look after themselves and nothing else. would advice the top management to recruit good management team from outside as the in-house manager's are not fit to lead as they give importance to personal only who they are related or know who he or she is . 
Fannie Mae,Procurement Manager,3,management is too concerned with fitting the liberal agenda in Washington rather than actually attending to the overall housing industry. the new CEO is a joke.
Fannie Mae,Cloud Infrastructure Engineer,5,"Great place to start working. Work life balance is very good. Remote working permanent is a huge perk, along with flex-fridays.On full days of work, you do work a lot but overall very nice with the amount of true time outside of work."
Fannie Mae,DevOps Engineer,1,"Employees have this facade of being interested in the work you do but they either reject it to your face or manipulate your responsibilities to make it seem like what you're going to be doing is important when infact it depletes your skill set and before you know it you're just filling out spreadsheets.  Additionally no respect of work/life balance (had to work weekends and off hours with absolutely no compensation for that time taken).  Management is incompetent, just say a bunch of buzz words to make them seem like they know what they're doing but all in all they know nothing and just want to make themselves look good, no technical expertise whatsoever."
Fannie Mae,Residential Real Estate Appraiser II,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great culture, people, benefits-Outstanding place to work!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Progressive changes in a fast paced environment.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Newer very nice office with a diverse cultureWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Timely and productive with good computer systems!"
Fannie Mae,ETL Developer,4,"Great work life balance, you get Fridays off early, it depends on your team but the company has amaxing benefits, the only thing lacking is the compensation. You recieve no stock, raises seem like they get less and less every year. "
Fannie Mae,DevOps/Build and Release Engineer,5,Really enjoyed the work environment and the people that I have worked with. The benefits are great and I had excellent health insurance options to choose from. PTO and other benefits were also very amenable.

Fannie Mae,Senior Associate,4,"Pro:Good pay, work/life balance.Benefits Con:Limited opportunities for growthManagement wasnt open to change. Bad at channeling information. Bureaucractic."
Fannie Mae,Graphic Designer,1,"I have heard great things about FNME and i was so excited to join. I landed a decent contract however the onboarding was a failure, team culture was abhorrent and communication with individuals was depressing. Utterly arrogant members with zero communication skills and zero strategy. Very cliquey (old vs new) and zero employee support. made me hate my day to day work. Top reason why i left. "
Fannie Mae,Analyst,5, amazing growth and development. Great place to be and learn. Lots of opportunity to choose your own path and career! People are nice understanding and want to support and help you! 
Fannie Mae,Project Analyst,5,Absolutely best place to work. Superior culture. Life changing teammates.  Highly recommend this organization to anyone. Very engaged and supportive leadership team.

Fannie Mae,SDET/QA Automation Engineer,4,"Remote work, good work life balance, pay is average, good learning opportunities, kinda like a government work place feel to it. Very transitional, many come and go"
Fannie Mae,IT Project Manager,4,"Always seemed to be asked to do more with less...was given way too many projects to work on, which turned out to be a detriment.  A lot of red tape as well as groups are weary to make decisions...which delays implementations.  "
Fannie Mae,Analyst,2,"Could be a great place to work if management was better. Managers gossip about their own employees to other members of the team, display favoritism, and allow dysfunction and workplace bullying to go unchecked. "
Fannie Mae,Business Analyst,4,"Descent place to work, good work/life balance. Your experience will vary greatly by group and manager. The pay is above the average for the DMV area, but nothing spectacular. Work can also get repetitive and boring."
Fannie Mae,Analyst,5,Great working environment to learn and grow. There were always meetings everyday but this encouraged strong communication between management and employees. 
Fannie Mae,Technology Engineer Manager,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?The overall benefit package can’t be beat. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The lack of clear direction by some of the bosses in the company. I’ve had some really good leaders and some really poor bosses. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The environment is very flexible and the culture is accepting. There are a ton of special programs and groups for all cultural types you can think of. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Starts early, work through lunch so you can get out reasonably close to on time. TONs of meetings. Seems that all we have once you are in management."
Fannie Mae,Analyst,3,It was stressful.Hyphen Interchangeable.            Condescending. stressful. stressful.stressful.   It was stressful. It was a stressful environment. I was under pressure.
Fannie Mae,Accountant,3,Amazing company to work for  only con is people stay until retirement so it is hard to move up. Great culture and benefits and overall amazing. Great benefits and training 
Fannie Mae,QC Analyst,1,"I liked working there but the preference is millennials, so anyone past the age of 50 was let go.  Management was good but no longer there due to all the layoffs.  Too many managers at times so it depends on which one one works for how the day goes, for me it was good.  They do favor men and pay men 100% more than women. "

I have support from all angles and levels of management, and they make me feel validated and important enough to where I can always speak up in the prescience of upper management in meetings.I really cannot complain about even a single aspect. They care about their employees’ well being and even let us decide whether we want to be completely remote (and even work from anywhere in the country) or come in any days. "

Fannie Mae,Senior Associate,5,"Fannie Mae is a great place to be professionally and personally for development. My managers were very attentive, but gave me the space I needed to focus unless I asked for help. It was definitely a flex schedule so you have to have great time management skills and be able to push yourself!"
Fannie Mae,Technical Project Manager,3,Great people and pay and benefits - if you have a great team behind you things are great - but don’t step on political land mines.  Overall great place except for some managers not easy to handle  
Fannie Mae,Accounting Operations Manager,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The benefits , and the ability to collaborate across different business units  with very little red tapes. I love the fact that I work for a company who is so active in our communities What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not having a clear path to a promotion despite getting amazing reviews, a the top 1 ratingWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?I love the culture, we get lots of opportunities to get together and celebrate the various successes.

I am always on a project rollout as a Product Owner lead because of my knowledge, and I would think also based on my work ethics, and my ability to get along and coordinate with other business units"
Fannie Mae,Operational Support,5,"When the pandemic started, Fannie Mae went immediately to remote work.  Upper management and the CEO continued to reach out to the employees and helped keep morale up, while ensuring that the employees still felt connected.  The colleagues that I worked with were engaged and always willing to help make me more successful.  Fannie Mae was a very good place to work. "
Fannie Mae,Manager,5,"I love the culture, hybrid work options, work/life balance and commitment of management to employees.  The company has done a lot in 2022 to add benefits and compensation for employees. "

Fannie Mae,Loan Management - Foreclosure Specialist,5,I dont have anything to say. Fannie Mae is a great company to work for.  Great work life balance and pay. I would recommend this company. I would go back if i had the chance. 
Fannie Mae,Software Engineer,5,"Team is very kind and helpful, work is not so challenging, which makes for boring tasks at times, but work life balance is stellar. When there are interesting features to work on, work gets fun again."
Fannie Mae,Analyst,4,"Good maternity benefitsGreat learning environment : lots of smart people, get to know everything about mortgage finance, if you are inquisitive enough "
Fannie Mae,Senior Associate,3,"The heart of this company is fantastic. The mission of the company - essentially to help people become homeowners and lower the racial housing gap, is an extremely important mission you can feel good about working towards. Most of the company’s Management Committee are hard working, well-meaning, honest people. The problem is, their intention gets lost somewhere around middle management and as a result, the associate level for the most part does not believe the hype. Most associates are overworked and underpaid, and with the company still working under a conservator, they don’t have ability to approve any company wide pay/benefit increases. Culture is toxic and dysfunctional in many departments and HR does not seem an effective support mechanism for employees - as a result it appears the company is hemorrhaging really talented employees. This is just my view from many years experience in the Marketing and Communications department.  It could be a different experience elsewhere in the company - which again is a good company with great intent. "
Fannie Mae,Mortgage Underwriter,3,The benefits were good included 401k. At the time Fannie matched dollar for dollar. The  health insurance by Aetna  cost was reasonable and the coverage was great
Fannie Mae,Advisor,2,"Favorable compensation and benefits, but the work culture is extremely toxic.  Rude emails, forced collaboration with uncooperative people and everything is re-worked to death.  High turnover means something is not working.  "
Fannie Mae,Underwriting Support Specialist,5,I enjoyed the teamwork and management while I worked at Fannie Mae. The job tasks provided always kept me busy and engaged. The benefits were amazing.
Fannie Mae,Project Analyst II,2,Benefits are great Pay isn’t up to parVery discriminatory Say they focus on diversity and inclusion but only a few actual diverse departments Hard to get promoted 
Fannie Mae,Operations Engineering Associate,5,"Signing bonuses, yearly bonuses, AND yearly raises are given, no matter the position. I am very much encouraged to take time off, and will even get reprimanded if I respond to emails while on vacation. I have support from all angles and levels of management, and they make me feel validated and important enough to where I can always speak up in the prescience of upper management in meetings.I really cannot complain about even a single aspect. They care about their employees’ well being and even let us decide whether we want to be completely remote (and even work from anywhere in the country) or come in any days. "

Fannie Mae,Instructional Designer,5,"I’ve been a full-time employee for a few months. Projects are interesting and meaningful, and my co-workers are talented, smart, supportive, and collaborative. A great place to work."
Fannie Mae,Project Manager/RTE,4,"I absolutely loved working at Fannie Mae.  Great company that always cared about Work Life Balance and that has a great purpose.  However, in the last few years, focus shifted from employees to trying to go public again, hence cutting into compensation for people and budgets, therefore causing folks doing jobs of more then one person.  "
Fannie Mae,Loan Management – Senior Associate Operations,5,"It's a wonderful place to work and the culture is awesome. Management, benefits, and work-life balance are all great. My advice to new employees would be to take advantage of networking and or training opportunities. And look for opportunities to move around every few years. "
Fannie Mae,Category Manager - Advisor,3,"Wonderful work/life balance. You get every Federal holiday, half day Fridays, start off with 3 weeks vacation (max out at 4 weeks, yet can roll over 5 days / year), very good benefits and the company now gives you a choice of remote, in-office or hybrid.  However, there isn't much room for positional growth, nor compensation growth.  You must push for a high base coming in, as annual increases aren't even half of inflation and bonus may vary based on position & internal group.  Company like to speak of diversity, yet barely any African-American above Sr. Mgr level."
Fannie Mae,Associate,4,"In Finance, work/ life balance needs improvement. There is alot of pressure to meet deadlines that apoear to be unrealistic as employees are constantly working into the evening. "
Fannie Mae,Triage Specialist,2,"routine job just review the docs and correct mistakes.  The job was easy pay wasn't that good . People are not very kind , you can't trust anyone there .  Job security is sucks.  They will tell you that contract for at least 6 months but you can  get lay off in 3 months for no wrong doing ."
Fannie Mae,Senior Associate,5,"Fannie Mae is a great place to work and grow your career. It's just not a place where you're going to get promoted in your current role. That said, once you're in your position for a year, you can apply to another internal role.  "
Fannie Mae,Senior SharePoint Administrator,4,"Pros: FM will I help  with closing cost on your first home purchase.There are  good interships Cons:IMO too many managers and few engineers that are doing the hands on work, so workload is intense and you are expected to work after hours/weekends "
Fannie Mae,Foreclosure Specialist III,4,The people were the best part of the job. Management was pushing to outsource by any means necessary. No comment on overall work experience as it was a stepping stone to bigger/better.
Fannie Mae,Project Lead,4, Very nice .Lot of learning n gr8 team Nice technicals Good rocking atmosphere. Home mortgage. Flexible working hours .Very nice project manager.Good career growth 
Fannie Mae,Board Coordinator II ,4,The executive management team has been great throughout the pandemic. They thoroughly think about the things surrounding the pandemic from the health of employees to ensuring the office needs while working from home. Excellent job executive management. 
Fannie Mae,Mortgage Trainer/Desktop Originator Area Manager Southwest Region,2,They have favorites who do not work but depend on other people to do the work and for them to get the glory is very manipulative and some management would gear the wrong way to make themselves look good
Fannie Mae,Scrum Master,4,"Fannie is a great place to learn.  The overall culture is to learn from trainings, from colleagues, and experiment at work.  Management supports out of box thinking."
Fannie Mae,Business Operations Analyst,4,Fannie Mae is a family oriented company with a great family life balance motto.  We have the best benefits in the country.  Remote is a great option for families with kids
Fannie Mae,Chief Engineer,5,I had a great group of team members in the Engineering Department. We took care of  All aspects of the facility.  I would recommend this company to anyone who's looking for a job.
Fannie Mae,Manager,5,"Excellent place to work for with great benefits, good work life balance and excellent learning opportunities. Great people and our new offices have state of the art technology"
Fannie Mae,End User Technology Services Associate,5,Great company culture that is active in making a change. The CEO actively keeps the employees updated on what Fannie Mae is doing currently and planning on doing in the future. Responded ASAP to COVID outbreak in March 2020 and has accommodated employees because of it.
Fannie Mae,Data Analyst,5,"People are really nice, helpful and professional. Great working life balance. Data might be boring if you are not interested in finance or accounting data. "
Fannie Mae,Manager,4,"Good remote culture.  Strong approval of COO and their DE&I initiatives.  Good company mission, but behind the times in engineering practice(s) and tooling.  "
Fannie Mae,Operations Engineering Associate,5,"Signing bonuses, yearly bonuses, AND yearly raises are given, no matter the position.

Fannie Mae,Data Engineer,4,Great company to work for . Stress free. HAve a great work life balance . Paternity leave. 401k match . Except the salary increase is not that great compare to other companies.
Fannie Mae,Sr. Software Engineer,5,"Wish advancing in the company was easy. Management doesn't care. Sometimes people go through 3 round of interview to get ""promotion.""Some manager are good other don't care "
Fannie Mae,Senior IT Specalist,4,"Fannie is ok to work at nothing special, especially as a contractor. It isn't accessible to get hired full-time.  I think management should give contractors an equal opportunity also."
Fannie Mae,Associate,4,It's a good company with good benefits and good compensation. Your experience will depend largely on what team you are on and the manager you have because it's a very large enterprise. Leadership is not completely transparent and re-orgs are frequent. 
Fannie Mae,REO Manager,4,"Looks good on the resume.Lots of former employees or relatives of former employees.Limited advancement opportunities. Lost many experienced FTE's, resulting in lower healthcare costs. This may have been the goal..."
Fannie Mae,Associate,5,Benefits and work life balance are excellent. Projects could move a bit faster. Managers are supportive but you’ll quickly notice that they have their favorites. Conservatorship has stifled increases and bonuses
Fannie Mae,Application Support Specialist,3,"The place was good for anybody that wants to get paid well and learn. Just didn't have the right work/life balance for me personally and almost every day was a high stress in the area where I worked. Remote working also kind of butchered the learning process, but that wasn't their fault."
Fannie Mae,Associate,5,Fannie Mae emphasizes work-life balance. My managers are understanding and flexible when it comes to work. The company is pushing towards more social justice work. 
Fannie Mae,Business Analyst,3,People don't get the pay they deserve and managers favor those who have been in the team's longer. They move people around to positions that their skill set does not align. 
Fannie Mae,Business Analyst,2,"Fannie Mae has historically been a good place to spend a career, with great work life balance.  However, this also means that everybody is disposable.Most positions at Fannie Mae would allow average employees to complete their daily tasks within 5 hours of work.  If employees are more efficient, a day's work could likely be completed within 3 hours, and, if the process were to be revamped, what is now a day's work for some positions could probably be done in less than an hour.This shifts an employee's value away from their contribution, and toward  a more political workplace.  Employees can either get ahead through self-promotion or keep their head down and enjoy an easy, laid-back job.The other side of this is that the other shoe drops quite often-- restructuring is constant and employees are often laid off regularly.  There is not much communication for how and to whom these initiatives will affect, or what the planning behind it is.  "
Fannie Mae,Application Support Analyst,5,budget cuts are scary lol it was a good job with great benefits. If i could go back I probably would after the covid situation is over an ppl can work onsite
Fannie Mae,Loan Servicing Specialist II,4,The company was great culturally but advancement was about who you know. Speaking in a specific department they looked out for their friends first. Given the opportunity again I would definitely go back and work there.
Fannie Mae,Analyst,3,lack of work and life balance. and useless management that never gives an answer. It goes circles. Employees are good but the mid-management levels don't care about the people much. 
Fannie Mae,Senior Associate Finance ,5,"Great company with a clear mission and cultural.  Lots of people leaving due to no raises and bonuses for a few years. Limited hiring of full time employees once people leave. They are just replacing most position with contractors. The company is cutting back on benefits. Also, promotion are really hard to come by ."
Fannie Mae,Configuration/Change Manager,4,"I worked as a consultant in CM team. It was a great team to work with. The working hours were great and flexible. Overall, it was a good environment to work and grow career-wise."
Fannie Mae,SE Mgr,2,"Old tech, legacy, very hierarchical. Zero room to grow ! tons and tons of processes which are clear waste of time. Innovation is on name sake only. Very old fashioned."
Fannie Mae,Security Engineer I,5,This was a good company to work for.  The compensation and benefits were great.  I enjoyed the mentoring I got and learned valuable lessons.                  
Fannie Mae,Enterprise Program Manager,4,"The company tries really hard and talks the people first talk all the time.  However, this often fails in execution.  Lack of trust and transparency across all orgaanizations.  Very siloed. Depending on where you are and WHO you are there is not much room for growth.  Fannie Mae would rather let go of experienced workers than continue to grow internal talent.  Organizational knowledge is diminished because a cheaper workforce is now of greater value. The mission-driven company of the 90s no longer exists."
Fannie Mae,Operations Analyst,5,Pay could be better! Little room for advancement in  my department  Coworkers can be catty. Contractors are not treated well in most cases. It’s a sink or swim
Fannie Mae,Analyst,3,"Politics, incompetent managers that play favorites and director level and above that have no idea what goes on in the trenches.  Favorites are rewarded and working hard wont get you anywhere. If you want to play the game this is the place for you. They also like to downsize every few years and love the phrase, ""do more with less."" "
IBM,Salesforce Platform Administrator,4,less compensation but learned a lot . Great management and work life balance .No job security - Layoffs are the ritual of every year.Lots of opportunity to grow
IBM,Account Manager,5,Plenty of room for growth. Have learned from previous acquisitions and there is a great deal of room for growth within the IT Automation space around cloud cost management
IBM,Financial Analyst,5,"Great place to work, good compensation and lots of flexibility. I had great co-workers and leadership. I left to focus on education, however, I would definitely go back any day."
IBM,Consultant,2,"In Consulting the worst part of the company are the industry partners and the area managers, especially the younger ones.The former sell the possible below cost, the latter create an almost feudal environment in which the closest people (often for pure sympathy) are favored and pushed into the career, and the others are put to pick up the project holes with false objectives and prospects ofCareer, never honored with the excuse of orders from above. Good wipes from Junior, but then very slow as growth. Polding of learning instead very interesting, even if the training in presence are often assigned with little criterion. For now total smartworking withoutchecks, despite the 2 days/weekend from the contract"
IBM,Machine Operator,1,"As a manager at XYZ Corp, my experience has been highly rewarding. The company fosters a collaborative environment where team members are encouraged to innovate and take initiative. Leadership is approachable and open to new ideas, making it easier to implement changes that drive results. The training programs provided a solid foundation, equipping me with the skills to effectively manage cross-functional teams and complex projects. Work-life balance is highly valued, and the company's flexibility allowed me to maintain personal commitments while excelling at work. However, like any organization, there"
IBM,Cash Disbursement Team Member,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Nothing. Maybe the people I met. They refused to train there were many emails sent about the issue. They allowed their clients to bully them and their employees I won’t say who their clients were but it’s a soft drink company. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not being trained. And at the end being stuffed with information that would take some one a year or more to learn What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Remote so you don’t see others unless it was on zoomWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Zoom calls, listening to the clients saying we are not working hard enough. Asking for help getting none.  Trying to keep up the flow of things"
IBM,HR Service Delivery  Lead,4,liked the hybrid set up but allowances are not increasing plus we dont have good benefit. No free HMO dependent. No retirement fund. Decent salary increase is only when you got promoted
IBM,Site Reliability Engineer,3,"If you get on a good team you're generally ok, but there has been an increase in offshoring in the last few years. Management priorities change frequently. "

IBM,Account Manager/Sales,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Gratitude is the most important aspect of teaching..sprinkled with love and a sincere desire to improve the academic and social trajectory of success in EACH studentWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Grading assessment and parental conferences and updates… co-workers who do not have the same empathy for struggling studentsWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Excellent and engaging rewarding and  seeing projects and task completed in a timely and professional mannerWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Enter early work diligently throughout the entire day take two breaks to rejuvenate my excitement and curiosity stay late and prepare an “outline” for the next day classes
IBM,Project Manager,5,"What is the best thing to work in the company? A large company, with mature processes, high -level professionals, and where the growth ceiling is determined by you.

IBM,Recruitment Specialist,3,The RPO isn’t stable and you feel like “just a number”. Many of the accounts are new and not organized. They can abruptly move you to another account. Not a good experience and wouldn’t go back. 
IBM,Advisory Software Engineer,3,Work/Life balance is good.  There is too much process and move slowly compare to the competitors.  Very often there is resource action which impacts morale
IBM,Senior Managing Security & Privacy Consultant,4,"You’re given the flexibility to work your way, so long as you prove yourself. The work was challenging, interesting and involved close interaction with clients. "
IBM,Application Security Engineer ,4,I like IBM its a fun place to work. IBM gives you lot of learning opportunities and work life balance is great. Do not expect much in terms of salary hike.

IBM,Sr. Software Development Manager,3,"I have the privilege of working for Ibm for over 20 years. In that as a manager, I laid off more people than I had working for me in my last position as an up line manager. I really like the company, but in the end, no matter who you are, you will hit a ceiling and if you just keep bouncing against that ceiling eventually, they’ll show you the door. By all means work for IBM and get the experience, job hop within the company if you can, if not, use it to better your opportunities outside the company both in position and salary."
IBM,Tester QA,4,"It is a company that helps when you start your work career, it has good performance, the bad is for salary increase there is a lot of favoritism on the part of managers."

IBM,Finance Transformation Leader,3,"A great place to work depending on your role, age, and location.  Not so good for older employees outside of main sites.  Pay is competitive.  Work is demanding but hours are flexible."
IBM,Analista de Benefícios,3,"What is the best part of working in the company?Therefore the salary range is very low by the amount of work demand.What is the most stressful part of the work in the company? The volume of contracts are large, so it is a lot of delivery that can exceed your working hours and even weekends.Very stressful and confusing 😕 How are the environment and work culture in the company? Toxic environment depending on the customer and managers.But it is not general to sectors that are worth insisting, but the opportunities are barred depending on your manager. How is a typical day for you in the company? Each one with their problems.Although we are a team.It is not always collaborative."
IBM,Application Developer & Package Consultant,4,"The work culture at IBM is both dynamic and supportive, fostering an environment where innovation thrives. Employees have the opportunity to collaborate closely with clients on cutting-edge projects, while gaining exposure to a diverse range of technologies, regardless of their position. The organization offers flexible working hours, and the team, including both colleagues and managers, is friendly and encouraging. This is an excellent place to launch your career, offering stability and growth within a secure organization."
IBM,Application Developer,3,Good culture of continued learning but past that extremely lackluster. It doesn't matter if you're a hard worker as long as you do the bare minimum you are sure to succeed. Very low salary compared to industry standards and will block you from transferring if you get an offer for an internal transfer. Good luck getting a raise and good luck getting validated for your efforts.

IBM,Managing Consultant,5,"It was very flexible, but you have to be able to manage your work life balance. Politics could interfere with career goals. Be ready to travel! The best thing about working here are the people you will work with. IBMers care about the work that they do. On the best teams, people still have a great sense of integrity, and will honestly advocate for their clients rather than being a bunch of yes men."

A moment say ""if you change at the 9 AM-6pm schedule you only come 1x per month"" without spending or 2 weeks, they already tell you that you will have to come 2-3x per week and without theTransport that you would have at any other time. A moment they told me ""on Fridays they will be your business day"" Then they say goodbye for not working that Friday. It is an impossible mission to progress, wages are not equitable, the benefits are difficultto take advantage, and in general there is an exaggerated level of disorder.The environment at the headquarters of Costa Rica is very unprofessional.For example, when you get to work and return home goes a little more than an hour and becomes 2h30mins or even more. They do not provide solutions to anyone for anything.There is no flexibility.There is no growth.Departments as executive assistants are only considered an expense for the company, unlike others as cybersecurity that is valued, they receive better salary, benefits, even transport (although they do not need it because their salary allows to buy car or live near the company)."

The products and services I received did not meet the quality that was advertised. Despite multiple attempts to get assistance, there was no significant improvement or follow-up from their team.

IBM,Regional Sales Executive,5,"My “Work family” at IBM are some of the smartest people I have ever worked with. Everyone is well educated, professional, and has a quick mind.  The workforce is older for a tech company.  It’s the little things like there are no snacks, coffee and there is classical music playing. I liked it but many tech millennials & Z’s make it the butt of a joke. There is no coffee!. The aesthetic is dated.

Johnson & Johnson,Foundry Operator,2,"J&J wasn’t the worst place to work.  The specific tasks I performed I didn’t dislike.  I would say the benefit package was slightly better than average.  Pay was average, but raises were weak.  Management was a mixed bag.  Some were good.  Others, not so much.As for the ugly, the deck is stacked against you if you don’t know people in higher places.  Nepotism and favoritism are rampant!  And they make no effort to hide that.  The environment is very “cliquey”.

But when severe problems and toxicity started to emerge, no one from leadership or the 3rd party credo hotline came to help. It has made people lose their minds, quit their jobs, retaliatory PIPs are their best friend, over working in the hopes of silent quitting, and so on. It is SO HIGHLY POLITICAL. If you cross the wrong person's path, you will be blacklisted from promotions, bonuses, or career development opportunities - and there are ALOT of people in leadership you don't want to cross paths with. My advice, if you still are looking to pursue this company, keep your head down and stay out of everyone's way. It truly is a dog-eat-dog world there, even when they shove ""family culture"" down your throat. There is a reason why employee retention is alarmingly low.   "

Eventually things settled down, we got back to 3 supervisor rotation and then I got to move up rather quickly based on my performance during the ""tough times"".  My managers were the best, and then I got transferred to New Jersey with a nice promotion.   I came back to Texas, but had changed to Texas Instruments.

Johnson & Johnson,Atendente,5,"Tops too much, I really liked Z leisure, great collaborators, people are wonderful, I recommend it a lot, you feel good working there, and the salary is very good"
Johnson & Johnson,Cook,5,Hood haven’t been there to work to see was trying to see if there a good company or no was just wondering if they was or not so I can let people know to work there r not 
Johnson & Johnson,Intern,1,"Minimal pay and long hours. Working at JNJ has been a disappointing experience marked by poor management decisions and a lack of clear communication. The workplace culture is stifling, with minimal opportunities for growth or recognition of employee contributions. Team dynamics are strained due to frequent micromanagement and a pervasive sense of favoritism among supervisors. Moreover, the company's infrastructure is outdated, hindering productivity and making even simple tasks unnecessarily complicated. Employee welfare seems to be an afterthought, with inadequate support systems for professional development or work-life balance. Overall, JNJ fails to foster a positive and motivating work environment, making it challenging for employees to feel valued or motivated in their roles. "
Johnson & Johnson,Project Manager,5,Wonderful culture and management. I’m very happy to be working here and proud of the things we do. If you wanna work in a company that makes like saving products this is definitely the place work 
Johnson & Johnson,Senior Quality Engineer,5,Not a great place to work.Lot of favoritism and less focus on actual capable employees.Less importance give to the complaints made. Not a people friendly manager 
Johnson & Johnson,Production Technician,4,"Ok place to work if you are ready for the shift work. Month of days and nights, 12 hours shift. Overall job is not hard but can be stressful from time to time. Managers could take more effort into training new employees as well as organising some touring since the facility is enormous. Colleagues are friendly and helpful so overall atmosphere is nice. "

Johnson & Johnson,Gerente de ventas Alta especialidad ,5,"What is the best thing to work in the company? The benefits and salaries. What is the most stressful of working in the company? The constant pressure for the result What is the environment and the work culture in the company?Well, collaborative, competitive. How is a typical day for you in the company? Start 9am has no term"
Johnson & Johnson,Senior Manager,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits and pay. Nothing else What is the most stressful part about working at the company?People are very disrespectful and have low integrity and morals. New ideas are quickly shot down by legacy employees and the training program is herendous What is the work environment and culture like at the company?They talk about DE&I but don’t practice it at all. Too many legacy employees who don’t hold each other accountable. They violate policies knowingly. Their superiors are their friends so a blind eye is turned to violations. What is a typical day like for you at the company?I have to learn what my support perform and do on a daily basis because they refuse to do the tasks required of them that supports me. A task that should take an hour with the help of a support group takes me 6 hours because I have to learn to do the task myself. Too many meaningless meetings to attend and poor tracking of action items with the correct owners.
Johnson & Johnson,Clerk de producción,5,"Good company, it has excess staff but in general good benefits, bonis of productivity, activities related to the community, it is difficult to enter"
Johnson & Johnson,Trial manager,4,The work/life balance is great and really helps with stress.  I like the people I work with and my manager so I’m very happy with this company.   Only con is they are slow to promote.  
Johnson & Johnson,Intern,4,"There is a big emphasis on learning at J&J. Once you are in, people tend to stay because there is not just vertical growth, but lateral growth where you can pursue your passions. "
Johnson & Johnson,Process technician ,3,"The place is going down the toilet. Lots of lines shut down now. The new ""technician's"" they hired are absolutely useless and don't do any work, which means the experienced guys have to do it all. Management are great either and Overtime has now been banned too."
Johnson & Johnson,Warehouse Worker,3,Working  at  Johnson  and  Johnson   is  good  for  people  that  don't  really  know  English  or  the  older/younger  crowd  that  are  either retired  or  students. 
Johnson & Johnson,Pick Pack and Ship Associate,5,"Johnson and Johnson is a great place to work. It's a learning and growing company. I really enjoyed my time there and if I didn't have to relocate I would probably still be there. I loved my responserbilities as an employee. My promotion. My team players were great people to work with,also management was fair."
Johnson & Johnson,Ejecutivo Comercial,4,Companies with various growth opportunities.Salary a little lower compared to other companies in the sector.Much administrative load in addition to field work
Johnson & Johnson,Operador de Produção Especializado,2,"What is the best part of working in the company? It was, while I was there, to read the staff that exposes the mission, values, vision and also the policies of the company, having the daily hope, that everyone, at all levels: operational,Intermediate and institutional, they had impact and were touched by this feeling! What is the most stressful part of the work in the company? The climate generated by competitiveness between equivalent levels. As the environment and the culture of work in the company?Work culture needs to be better supported, especially at the intermediate level.The institutional level could modulate work teams, aiming to reduce the negative impacts of competitiveness. How is a typical day for you in the company? It was busy and challenging.The possibility of the employee being able to optimize the process through projects like Eureka was rewarding and motivating."
Johnson & Johnson,Financial Analyst,1,"My experience there was not successful, as I had a very toxic boss who was very unprofessional by stressing me out and making me doubt myself. After joining I learned that 3 of my predecessors left the team due to the same reason. I gave up with my end of service of around ~AED 24k - I could have taken it if I completed a year in the company. I worked 11 month and 2 weeks choosing my mental health and I never regretted. "

The supportive work environment and comprehensive training programs have equipped me with the skills and confidence needed to excel in my role. The company’s commitment to innovation and quality is evident in the cutting-edge products we represent, making it easier to engage clients effectively. Additionally, the competitive compensation and clear opportunities for career growth have made this job both fulfilling and motivating. While the fast-paced nature of the role can be challenging, the overall experience has been overwhelmingly positive."
Johnson & Johnson,Coordinadora de Seguridad,5,Typical day very accelerated to evaluate risks excellent inclusive and respectful culture
Johnson & Johnson,Sales,4,"Slow to market, it’s all about who you know. If you live in a big city you are more likely to get what you need but if you’re rural, good luck. Benefits are good though. Don’t fall for the scam that once you’re hired, it’s easy to transfer internally. It is not unless you know the right people. Otherwise your just a name on an application and they still don’t give you the time of day or even an email back as to why you weren’t selected. "
Johnson & Johnson,Engineer,5,What an exciting opportunity for everyone who is here and there we love working for everyone and at that time we will continue to see that people are working greater 
Johnson & Johnson,Analista chimico,3,Excellent for learning and acquiring skills.Young environment.A little false environment based on appearances.Poor possibility of indeterminate if graduates.
Johnson & Johnson,Cx,3,"The company offers good benefits, but it has several ISSUES. Growth to management controls is very preferred towards the people of Colombia the responsibility does not depend on the country where you work, but also operation of other countries, this generates a saturating of activities very soonsince there is not much team.Your growth will always depend on someone you did not work with."
Johnson & Johnson,Project Manager,5,Management is nice and projects are interesting. You can grow as an employee within the company which is nice. The benefits are also something to consider. Overall nice job.
Johnson & Johnson,Operator,3,"great team, good management, friendly colleagues . they should avoid recruiting agencies, these make impossible to get a permanent contract with the company"
Johnson & Johnson,Operator,4,"Production was a bit high specially after going from 12 hours to 8 overall decent enough only couple of good supervisors, jobs not hard but repetitive "
Johnson & Johnson,Technician,3,"Overall good and nice company to work for. Contractors are not treated the same as internal employees which made me feel treated differently at times. Internal employees get 36 holidays which is really nice. Old buildings which the labs are not functioning probably in the summer with high temperatures. Salary is average, could be way better depending on your degree and work input. No negotiation is possible about salary which is ridiculous in this economy."
Johnson & Johnson,Promotor de Vendas e Merchandising,5,What is the best part of working in the company? The best part was adding even more my knowledge with Pharma which is the most stressful part of work in the company?Management was wonderful.How are the environment and work culture in the company?
Johnson & Johnson,"Manager, Data Analytics",4,"The company has a lot of great talents. Most people are nice and respectful. Good work life balance (also highly depends on your department and your role).Better pay than most pharm companies, especially considering the pension plan which is rare nowadays (BUT I could see it being discontinued anytime).Decent job mobility which is openly encouraged and facilitated.Downside is constant org changes and little respect to employees’ voices. Also pretty bureaucratic and a heavy people relationship company."
Johnson & Johnson,Sales Manager,5,"Strong credo based work approach, large company with good diversity and little bit of politics. Office location is not great as it is outside the city center and traffic can be bad"
Johnson & Johnson,Territory Sales Representative,5,"I've worked with J&J for more than 2 years, and this company really takes care of their people. If I didn't have to move, I would retire with this company. During covid, they company even provided a wellness benefit to make sure we healthy mentally and physically. With the wellness benefit we get to buy a gym equipment or anything health/mental related to keep us productive. I bought myself an apple watch and an indoor bike. "
Johnson & Johnson,Associate Director,3,"The overall company esperience was good. Some employees were not the best to work with, but you'll find that everywhere. Management could be better with communication, but not a bad experience overall."
Johnson & Johnson,Executive,3,"It is a good company from the outside, but quite messy from the inside including the processes, management, organization. Leadership should be stronger and clearer in what they want to actually achieve."

State Farm,Account Representative,4,"I want to make clear that I work for a State Farm agent, not State Farm corporate. As such, your experience will differ depending on the agent. Some are very knowledgeable and will teach you everything you need to know. They’ll also pay for your licenses and classes. However, the agent can decide how much they want to pay you. Not a lot of room for advancement either. You’d have to start your own agency or make the switch to the corporate side. Overall, not a bad introductory job to insurance. "
State Farm,Team Member,5,Absolutely beautiful family environment. Kind and hard workers. Very understanding and they treat you like family. This is the best place I have ever worked for. 
State Farm,Agent Team Member,3,"I applied to become a salesman but was giving a receptionist role instead. Not too bad in itself but when asked about opportunities to move to salesman position, I was told there were no openings when there were two empty offices and only one other salesperson in the building. When receiving calls from potential clients, I was strictly forbidden from giving new clients to any other salesman than the one mentioned. If I did to try and give the others a chance, i was reprimanded and scolded by my superior. "

State Farm,Claims Specialist,5,"I worked hybrid with them for almost a year and the claims to specialist ratio was unbalanced causing an overload of claims at one time in a wide range of zip codes requiring far travel. Management was kind but did not step in often when required or requested. It is a tough job, but it pays well and the benefits are great. "
State Farm,Office Representative,5,State Farm as a company is great but utilizes their own system and terminology compared to everyone else in the insurance industry and what your licensing courses teach you. Working for an agent can also be tough but overall is a good opportunity

State Farm,Licensed Customer Service Specialist,1,"Big work flow with little breaks, I work remotely and when I take a restroom I have to deduct the time I’m in the restroom from my normal breaks which is absurd, agreed on a schedule and a month in they changed it, they consider literally anything to be “negative wording” with customers even if you say “I am not for sure about that” they will give you a talk about it, also rates for them are insanely high so daily get screaming customers about their insurance going up by hundreds of dollars also their systems are horrible and always messing up while trying to help customers"
State Farm,Customer Service,1,What is the best part of working at the company?other staff members and work environmentWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?massive tasks to complete everyday.  lack of training for the programs required to work in.  number of clients to work with was more than could be services by the number of staff in the office.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?fun but stressful due to work loadWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?busy and always left work with more to do
State Farm,Auto Claims Adjuster,1,Like a good neighbor state farm is never there lol. What a jone of a company to work for. Unrealistic expectations and onky cares about metrics not the insured or workers
State Farm,Licensed Insurance Agent,2,"They make you believe that the roll you are training for is Sales, then tell you that its just a customer service role for the after hours call center for the agent's in the field.. if you have your licenses you are going to really let down and over qualified for the position "
State Farm,Claims Specialist,5,I formed genuine friendships at State Farm. My TM was great and very hands on. The optional OT did become non optional if there was a severe weather event. 
State Farm,Claims Associate,5,Great company & excellent benefits. Room for advancement. Would definitely recommend especially to someone wanting to start out in this industry. Working hybrid is also a plus!
State Farm,Team Member,4,work environment is very nice. everyone gets along and everyone is eager to help when is needed. it’s a family oriented office which works very smoothly.
State Farm,Agency Recruiter,5,Great CultureEver evolving and great experiencesHard work but rewarding workdevelopment opportunities are available.  May work non-traditional hours. 
State Farm,Customer Service Specialist II,1,"The quality of leadership is severely lacking. Their approach to personnel is disappointing and impersonal, and gives little to no regard for individual success, satisfaction or work-life balance. New hires are overwhelmed with information at a rapid pace, leaving minimal opportunity for thorough understanding. The training provided is insufficient, particularly considering the critical importance of good insurance. Given the level of training their call center employees receive, I would be uncomfortable relying on many of them to provide advice or make adjustments to my policies as a customer.The "
State Farm,Claims Specialist,4,Work in any department for that matter you are always in queue. Requesting time off is better than it use to be. The people on my team were always great & easy to talk to if they weren’t on the phones.

State Farm,Customer Service Representative,1,"Nice people, good training, overzealous micromanagement of human beings to the point that so many people want to quit. Big company that Needs to Reheis itself to its internal customers."
State Farm,Claims Associate,4,"I had an okay experience at State Farm. They offered great benefits but in Express, there was horrible micromanagement. Also, the metrics were borderline unachievable, but we were expected to handle 'expectational customer service'."
State Farm,Associate,2,Call center environment extremely busy with non-stop calls working in auto ILR.  Very metric oriented. Hard to stay long term. On the positive side they make it easy to service customers. Best to get a promotion as soon as possible.
State Farm,Claims Specialist,3,They are not family oriented. The training was all over the place and you basically have to learn most of your job on your own. My first manager was great and when he got transferred it was terrible after that
State Farm,Auto Damage Appraiser,5,"Despite the difficulties that come along with being an auto damage appraiser, working for State Farm has been a great experience. Great leadership...."
State Farm,Agent,1,Very fun and rewarding job offered healthy and beneficial compensation package and the work is something that leaves you satisfied at the end of the day
State Farm,Contact Center Representative,1,"Antiquated computer systems that do not function properly, micromanaged, treated like a machine instead of a person, expected to do the work of three people for minimum pay, raises are horrible."
State Farm,Claims Specialist,2,The job has steadily gotten worse since I started a few years back. Work loads have doubled and tripled in some cases but the metric requirements remain the same. It seems that upper management is grasping at straws at this point because the current system is not sustainable. They are bleeding money. Lower management doesn’t have the guts to tell upper management “no” or “this won’t work”.
State Farm,Underwriter,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Working from home is a plus !!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?You will loose your job if you don’t pass sooooo many test it’s stressful, feel like you in college and the training sucks What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The employees are nice but the staff are gatekeepers"

State Farm,Sales Associate,3,"I’ve learn a lot when I worked at State Farm about auto and health insurance, the job was great until it was time to hit commission. They push you a lot to hit certain numbers and sometimes it’s impossible to beat other quotes."
State Farm,Account Manager,1,"Poor management (it's obvious you're hired by a sales agent that tells you what you want to hear) , compensation lacks (small bonuses and no renewal) , salary isn't flexible as one would think, you have set hours and don't be late. You rely too much on salary coworkers and not enough time with manager "
State Farm,Team Member,4,"It’s good. Fair to employees, pay is decent. Commission is based on your sales. Sell more, make more. I like coming into work at 9. Gives me plenty of time to wake up."
State Farm,Secretary,5,Great place to work. Good hours too. Easy work but have to be professional and sometimes deal with rude customers. But overall is a great job to work at. 
State Farm,Customer Care Specialist,3,It’s a good place to work but it involves a lot of patience. You shadow someone for a week but after that you’re on your own. Can’t really ask a manager for help because they are always busy and when you use their help line they are sometimes clueless.
State Farm,Account Manager,3,Basically luck of the draw. Hope you get lucky with the office you apply to. There is essentially no fluid structure between offices and some agents are significantly more involved than others.

State Farm,Spanish Customer Service Representative,3,It’s not bad but they will micromanage you. The hours are good but you have to work Saturdays. Pay is decent right 22.50 hourly. I think it could be more. Hours are pretty flexible though 
State Farm,Underwriting Service Assistant,1,This job will not prepare you for an  actual underwriting assistant job. It’s a production job. Quantity over quality no matter what they say. And the pay is at the very low end compared to other companies offering the same title.
State Farm,Claim Associate,4,"ok place to work, If you have a good manager, it will make your day even better. Metrics are key for a good raise. Overtime is expected. Not enough time for lunch."

State Farm,Office Manager,5,"We actually take care of our customers, ourselves, and our families. We are able to actually do positive things for ourselves and community. It isn't all about just making a dollar. It's more about making a difference in the lives around us. "
State Farm,Insurance Producer,5,Very helpful people and Jolene is very supportive. The environment is flexible with both work from home and work hours. The office is good at what they do and honest with their customers. 
State Farm,Insurance Representative,2,"If you don’t like working on commissions, not the best place to be. Unless you have a good agent but most of them aren’t that great. Terrible environment if your agent sucks "
State Farm,Insurance Account Representative,5,Mainly do sales. Insurance sells itself to be honest. Its about how big you can build your circle and provide value where you can. The commission depends on the agency you are in but look for an agent who wants you to grow.
State Farm,Account Representative,5,Meet new people and protect families. It takes work to learn something new but once you get it gets easier. I enjoy doing the marketing events and being part of the community. 
State Farm,Claim Specialist-Property Complex-File Steward,4,"The management is super supportive here and have helped me excel in my role. I’m a Property Complex Claim Specialist so I handle a multitude of different issues everyday. These issues can take up a lot of time and big your workday down heavily. When I first started this job I was told I would be a Liability Investigator/ Adjuster, what you actually end up doing is being a generalist that handles every issue that other departments deem “out of our scope.” This leads to a lot of confusion and a brutal learning curve, but your peers and manager are there to help you which is the only saving grace for this job. Be warned though, working in claims is extremely stressful. State Farm has some work to do to improve the operations side of claims handling."
State Farm,Producer,3,Good introductory sales job. Pay isn't all that good. If you want to make a decent living you have to sell a lot. Micromanaging is very high in most offices.
State Farm,Claims Specialist,2,Working claims is pretty easy but there very little work life balance. They have non optional overtime that they require or you will receive a write up.
State Farm,Resident Producer,5,"I've been with State Farm for nearly four years now. It really all depends on the agent that you work for. I happen to have a wonderful boss. And he has 45 years invested into the company. So we really only take care of our existing clients, and it's a pretty laid back and quiet environment. I was able to choose my schedule, and I have a ninety minute lunch break, so i'm able to get a lot of things done during that time. "
State Farm,Customer Service Representative,4,Enjoyed my job. Didn't like calling past due customers. Good company to work for. Good environment. People were mostly helpful. Have to get insurance license 
State Farm,Insurance Agent,1,They really only want you to sell life insurance. They don't care how much you sell in any other line. They really should make the owners take leadership classes. 
State Farm,Team Member,5,Cold calling and getting sales.  Thebhardest part is not getting people on the phone as much as you'd like. The people are really good people who care about others. 
State Farm,ILR Claims Associate,3,If you like insurance then this is the place. Hard to get promoted to do anything outside of that. I think they could do better with raises. Not paid enough for what I’m doing

State Farm,Claim Specialist,1,Worst company ever. The team leaders suck. The systems suck. I quit because it was that bad. They don’t pay enough for all the responsibilities that you have to do. 
State Farm,Claims Adjuster,1,It’s ok. Good foundation but definitely look elsewhere for better pay and opportunities. Managers like to micromanage you. But just get the learning you need.

State Farm,Claim Specialist,5,Management always has your back and pushes for you to move up and get promoted. Benefits are good. Plenty of PTO and health insurance starting from day 1.

State Farm,Account Manager,5,"Great money, steady pay. Room for advancement within your agency. Also full benefits depending on your agent with retirement and 401k match. Work life balance is typical 9-5, off on holidays."
State Farm,Producer,4,"Lot of work, happy to help people from the same area. Compensation especially commissions depends on sales and type of policies you sell. Enjoyable if your agency provides a comfortable work environment. "
State Farm,Trainee insurance agent ,1,Don’t quit another job to join this company.They have no qualms about cancelling a full time job offer less than a week in to training.Not worth the hassle. 
State Farm,Customer Service Representative,5,"This was my first csr job, training was great, they set you up for success. Pay was good and you had a great work/life balance. Easy going place too.."
State Farm,Claims Adjuster,1,Super micromanaged horrible work environment. I don’t recommend anyone working there. Way too much work for the pay. And unrealistic and robotic work life.
State Farm,Subrogation Claims Specialist (Multi State Licensed),1,What is the best part of working at the company?There was not a day I enjoyed this job. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?State Farm is a high stress environment. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is not professional. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Too many unexpected meetings. State Farm does not expect you to do a job. They expect you to keep a metric system.

State Farm,Agent Staff,5,Great leadership and learning opportunities especially if you are looking into agency for yourself.  Can be fast paced some days but very well rewarded. 
State Farm,Life Insurance Agent,5,Great company to work for great benefits but poor work home life balance. They want you to put the job first family later. Great company for single parents

State Farm,SIU Claims Specialist,3,Not bad but no real short term advancement opportunities. Need to be with the company for several years before advancing. Good work schedule and work from home most of the time is a plus. Benefits are good and teammates are helpful. 
State Farm,Auto ILR,4,State Farm is a good company to work for. Some of the polices can be unfair. The pay for what we do is too low but decent.  Your work-life depends on the Manager that you get. 
State Farm,LIFE RESPONSE CENTER,4,Good training and lots of upward mobility. A lot of information to learn before going live on the floor. Constant calls in the LRC. Metrics driven. WFM controlled breaks

State Farm,Insurance Producer,3,"Dealing with the general public seems to be worse when you’re working with insurance. You get screamed at all day over prices you can’t change and didn’t decide, and you’re usually paid less than $40k"
State Farm,Customer Service Representative,5,"I was very happy at this job, had good coworkers and good bosses. I left do to relocation but in overall a nice place to work. Nice hours and we will get bonuses on performance and upselling."
State Farm,Claims Processor,3,Team work environment. Great team.  This kept the stress down. Could take a vacation without stress.  Poor manager with poor management skills.  Had obvious favorites. 
State Farm,Property Complex Claim Specialist,1,employees unfairly. Too much work and not enough support or assistance with questions Not enough time to complete the amount of work assigned. Heavily micro managed. 
State Farm,Auto Claims Adjuster,4,"Worked here for 3 years and enjoyed it. It was always busy, always something to do. I did feel overlooked when trying to advance probably from the lack of degree."
State Farm,Intern,3,Found my boss to be entirely professional but a little bit of a tougher boss than necessary overall I feel that my time at State Farm could be better used 
State Farm,Sales Representative,2,Toxic environment. They overwork you and pay you less and tell you if you don't like it to work somewhere else. So much for 'family'. They will pay new hires more than the people who have been working there over 10 years. 
State Farm,Retention Specialist,1,"Low pay Opening weekend is Friday, Sept 20th and Saturday, Sept 21st. As we discussed at your interview, we will have a ticket for you and a friend to come through that weekend, either night. Generally we don’t schedule New Hires to work opening weekend, but there are always exceptions to that rule. If you find yourself scheduled, make sure you can still get through the shows at some point. THIS WILL BE"

Tons if opportunities of growth!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Trying to advance sometimes can be a bit challenging What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's amazing! It's a very accepting environment What is a typical day like for you at the company?Perfect. We are a hybrid/ remote company. Makes going to work very easy!
State Farm,USA,4,Limited growth opportunities. Prior non State Farm work experience is not considered when seeking promotions at State Farm.  It’s all about your track record at State Farm which makes it harder to move around. 
State Farm,Claims Specialist,5,I enjoyed working with State farm and miss everyone terribly. The work life balance was incredible and the building I worked at was great. Our breaks were not watched like other businesses and we can even eat at our desks. What I loved most is State Farm really wanted us to be trained and knowledgeable with everything there was needed to know about each state and I was happy to be apart of this group. Sadly I had to move out of state and there wasn't an open position at the time in Florida from Illinois. 
State Farm,Customer Account Service,1,The worst most disrespectful company they do not adhere to human rights or employment law. They deny people the right to use the bathroom. They threaten people when they need to use the bathroom about points and metrics and being removed from the line of business. They do not train their personal properly. They're training is inadequate at best.
State Farm,Claims Specialist,3,"The department for claims is unstable. No organization. Very chaotic at times. Too many issues with claims, problems get passed around not really resolved. No accountability from management. Reactive instead of proactive when claim volume gets high. The claim load is too much for one person to handle. Handlers have too many roles  to fulfill.  Answering calls for customer service, taking their own calls, and handling claims while others are out plus their own claims.  There is an opportunity for overtime, and pay increases but it’s just not worth the stress.  Department needs structure."
State Farm,Claims Specialist,1,"State Farm is a hit and miss when it comes to meeting great people. Heavy workload, that puts a lot of stress. There are times where you will have to be moved to a different team. Just because how you performed on your last team and your Team Manager thought it was good does not mean it will work for the new Team Manager. Sometimes they will ""understand"" why you work a certain way and that you were trained that way, but then will come back and write you up for it. "
State Farm,Multiline Representative,1,"It started off well, but if you're not a butt kisser you're not going to get far. Everything is sales driven with very few benefits and culture is very anti-disability. Wants to run a call center and not allow people their own space. Does not fairly compensate with bonuses for work completed, even for those that are performing to monthly goals. Team building rewards are pizza parties but nothing special for someone with their family. Lots of big talk."
State Farm,ILR Associate,3,High volume call center with unrealistic metrics expectations. Very high turn over and an extremely stressful work environment. Training was not enough to prepare you for been on the floor 
State Farm,Agent,5,Good place to work The provide you with lists of potential clients and all pertinent information that may be needed to get the contacts that you may need to reach out to potential customers 
State Farm,Customer Service Rep,1,"The initial licensing is the ONLY training you get about insurance terminology.  The training classes are only to describe how to add vehicle etc.  The simulated training system does not match the live environment so you are lost the moment you start taking calls.  Mistakes are rampant.  Customers are not happy.  Rates are outrageous and they are discontinuing almost every discount other than multi-line and drive safe and safe.  If a customer has a claim - or even calls to ask about a claim, they WILL GET CANCELLED.  Then YOU will take the call from the angry person.  Rates have gone up 40% or more for most people.  The stress is incredibly high, you will not know what you are doing.  The call metrics are unreasonable and the ONLY thing that matters.  If you give good customer service, but your call runs too long, you will get in trouble for it.  It is God awful.  If you have any other options - choose something else.  It's really not worth it.  Providing great service for a bad company is still a negative experience.  It's a shame.  I thought it would be so much better or at lest different.  I REGRET THIS DECISION EVERY SINGLE DAY! "
State Farm,State Farm Agent Team Member,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Going home at the end of each day.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working for agents who only care about money. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Just don't be the new guy. You'll be fine What is a typical day like for you at the company?Constantly doing service work as a licensed agent even though there was an office manager, instead of sales which was my actual job."
State Farm,Title Processor,1,Not really much to say they never really wanted to teach anything. Training had nothing to do with the actual job. Everything was through zoom and no one on one interaction 
ADM,Senior Legal Counsel,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?The people were terrific to work with and the company provided significant opportunities for advancement.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Substantial volume of work with short timelines.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is professional, but aggressive.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work requests are received throughout the day with verying degrees of complexity or time constraints."
ADM,Manager,5,"Great place I would recommend to all my friends and family members. Always something new, never boring, great pay and benefits. I should have come sooner !!!"
ADM,Operator,1,Say something that doesn't want to be heard and management will just stare you down angrily and mock you. Overall this isn't a good place to work and wouldn't recommend it.
ADM,Electrician,1,I wouldn’t recommend ADM for any trades looking for work. You work minimum 6 days a week and the wages are low compared to anywhere else in the province. Maintenance manager is great but the senior leadership are micromanaging every detail and show a large lack of respect for maintenance trades. This place is just ancient obsolete equipment. I worked a year here and I have seen it getting even worse than when I started. Don’t waste your time. 
ADM,"Operation A Manager, Second Shift",5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Co Workers and Management. Lots of good people to work with. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Performing at a high level if that matters to the individual. So many factors out of one’s control. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It’s good. Good people and management to be around. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Fast paced, constant movement and work to do."
ADM,Lab Technician ,2,Very strict. Cannot check in until 3 minutes before your shift and can only clock out on the exact minute your shift ends. Workplace culture = drama. Not much privacy. Lots of gossip. Poor communication  about coursemill. Take tests on the daily. 
ADM,Process Operator,3,It was a very repetitive job and the swing shift got old very quickly. Their training program is extremely unprofessional and unorganized. It was difficult to advance in your role due to training restrictions.
ADM,Production Specialist,1,"My experience at ADM only lasted a month and in that month having patience for me lasted not even a week. I came in there with a hard working attitude and was more than willing to work hard for them. When you are a person like me who is smart but has High-Functioning Autism Spectrum disorder, you won't last. The management as well as other employees will have no patience for you. They gave me a month and as time went on I was getting better but the effort I put in was never enough. Only one or two people understood why or even cared. I was even insulted and called r*tarded by one of them who works in the Probe Stand. Just because that person had no patience for me. So before you  apply I would ask yourself, is it worth it if you are a bit slower? Because they poorly explain and train you and expect you to know the job like a professional within a couple days."
ADM,Level 1 Technician,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?It's a check, not a big one, but still a paycheck.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Misleading info when you start .  You are lead to believe you get two weeks of PTO from the start.  You only get oneWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Disorganized and not treated equally"

ADM,Operations Supervisor,3,"Good people. Old facility that runs non stop.  Knowledgeable people across most departments.  Obviously an important plant to the company, but it could use investment.  "
ADM,Production Operator,1,"Very draining place to work. No home, work balance. Management is terrible. You get treated like a number.  Always feel like your job is on the line. HR is a complete disaster they can’t handle there job at all. "
ADM,"Erlanger, KY",5,"Good benefits, the pay is really good and competitive with other companies.  Has great opportunities to advance your career.  Rewarding work, you are part of people's lives every day."
ADM,Plant Utility / Flour Transfer Relief,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Overtime is good but often forced.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The most stressful would be the expectancy to work 7 days a week and mean eyed if you didnt.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very toxic and fake smile by management. Union is horrible.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Shift length is not bad but they will bounce you around shifts like a rubber ball.
ADM,Grain Elevator Operator,4,The management at the Creve Couer AMD is second to none. The workers there are top notch and are more than willing to walk you through everything about the job. It’s a great place to learn and to grow professionally. 
ADM,"Reserve, LA",5,"I learned to become a team player, on hand's training quick development, understanding the principles of a work ethics.I learned how to work the cover station, how to operate a bobcat, sounding.The only thing I didn't like about working there was when they cut hour's, my favorite part about the job was over time was always available, but it's a great place to work and I'll recommend anyone to work there "
ADM,Operator,1,Management lacks clear communication and turns hostile in a very unprofessional and immature manner. The job itself is slow with equipment breaking frequently. Decent compensation for the area though. 
ADM,Production Worker,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Company is overall great. A lot of incentives for employees. Can move up if you are willing to learn. Show up and be on time along with be a team player. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The people who I work with are usually there for a check.
ADM,Machine Operator,1,"management is a joke, the less you do the more you are recognized and who you know, no training and lazy people that do absolutely nothing night shift is expected to do everything  "
ADM,R&D Microbiologist - Scientist ,5,Working at ADM is a great experience. Manager is always going to be supportive and compensation is good. There is a little gossip but not that bad. You can get limited overtime if wanted 
ADM,Probe Operator,5,"Very motivating , reliable, strong and open minded, assertive, leadership and teamwork , and no slacking ,make a positive impact on others.help find solutions.ask question if lacking understandment ,try to be better than yesterday "
ADM,Senior Legal Counsel,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?The people were terrific to work with and the company provided significant opportunities for advancement.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Substantial volume of work with short timelines.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is professional, but aggressive.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work requests are received throughout the day with verying degrees of complexity or time constraints."
ADM,Matinence,1,"Everything is constantly breaking down, the company would rather worry about production then take the time to fix and maintain the plant appropriately. This place is a living nightmare. But it pays the bills. (Barely)"
ADM,Maintenance Supervisor ,3,"Great benefits, good pay. It wasn't inside the plant so I didn't have as many corporate bosses around. I liked my job, my location was condemned.  I was told for months my job was safe, but then one day the superintendent walked in and let me go."
ADM,Operator 1,4,Good pay plenty of overtime good management if you like working a lot this place is for you and the benefits are decent and if you like making overtime money it's very easy to.
ADM,Grunt worker,1,"Get up early,30 minutes later you’re covered in sweat,dust and sloop from the pits and the tunnels,also try to work around the occasional rat.Low air levels.Badly maintained. The guys aren’t too bad to work with. The work doesn’t match the pay."
ADM,Operator,5,Hard work will get dirty and stink but good pay. Management is adequate if working night shift team lead is the person to really go to not for the weak a lot of lifting and carrying.
ADM,General Laborer,5,I worked for ADM for 12 years and really enjoyed my work there.  Its a great place to work and the benefits are very good.  The hours can be long during harvest but the rest of the time is easy.  Plenty of time to get caught up on work assignments.
ADM,Relief operator/utility,5,You never know what you will come into at night time I think that’s the best part for me because I was busy right when I get there and most cases there was an opportunity to learn something new that’s what I like the most 
ADM,Truck Driver Class A,1,"Work is easy , mgmt is non existent.. Favortism and mgr tals to you like a child, they are always right and never wrong and you are always wrong and never right !!!"
ADM,Operator,1,"Only care about production, nothing else matters.   Personnel safety is a joke.  Only way they know how to solve operational/maintenance problems is to throw money at it.  Never think problems through.  "
ADM,Financial Analyst,2,"This is such a bizarre company to work for...in my department no one seems to have any big picture understanding of the company or how our work relates to it...people constantly spout sentences filled with acronyms that they have no explanation for when asked. Also very little comradery among coworkers at adm which I value as extremely important. Due to previous outsourcing at the company, they constantly have team building activities that seem fake and no nothing to build a team...probably due to the fact that people r expecting their jobs to be outsourced next.  I would not recommend working here to even my worst enemy"
ADM,Mill Operator,3,Hot and nasty place to work. Great pay. Supervisors are lazy and a bunch of hard donkeys .Over all not a bad job. Bunch of climbing stairs and checking on equipment. Stuff likes to jam or choke up. Very humid wet and dusty environment lifting up to 100lbs
ADM, Boardwalk Ambassador ,4,"There was always something new to experience, you meet different people from other  places , you walk back and forth on the boardwalk in the cold and heat"
ADM,Lab Technician II,2,Love working at my job its just the people that I dont work with that have all the decisions. No upward mobility. Left to train people that will be above  you.
ADM,Production Utility Operator,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Feeling apart of something abd knowing that u are making a difference. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Remembering one day at a time. U will get where u are going.. just trust in the process!!What is the work environment and culture like at the company?U are up for the elements but people are nice and helpWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?12 hours of making sure safe practices are in place and making sure the process moves smoothly
ADM,Plant Utility,3,Loved working here. I learned something new every day and it was fun doing so. Unfortunately my time here came to an abrupt end when I took a mental health day and was promptly fired the very next day.
ADM,Account Manager,4,Pretty solid benefits. 6% 401k match with 3 weeks of vacation starting out. Laid back environment with decent chance of moving up. They don't fire anyone it seems so don't worry about working too hard. 
ADM,QA Technician,2,"Some coworkers were really good but management needs to change asap!! There is A LOT of favoritism and it shows! also, they treat the hispanic workers different from the american ones which is not fair considering that more than half the company is hispanic. Met some great people, wouldn't work there again"
ADM,"Joplin, MO",1,"You’d have better luck finding competency elsewhere. Working there was ultimately my worst working experience. A majority of management could be replaced by snakes and nothing would change. The loaders and cleaning staff were cool, as were lab workers. Everybody else was basically a middle schooler trapped in the body of an adult. "
ADM,Performance Excellence Practitioner,4,There are some strong areas with great leaders but there are equally areas with poor leaders.   Benefits and pay are excellent for managers.  The biggest downfall is that the organization is made of a lot of silos.  Each group is working for themselves with little collaboration across divisions.
ADM,Laborer,1,"Horrible work associates and upper manager, overall bad communication , the company sees most new employees as replaceable,they give little to know effort to improve "
ADM,Senior Legal Counsel,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?The people were terrific to work with and the company provided significant opportunities for advancement.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Substantial volume of work with short timelines.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is professional, but aggressive.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work requests are received throughout the day with verying degrees of complexity or time constraints."
ADM,Deckhand,2,Don’t go to Artco if you’re from another company. They don’t let you have a day off unless you use sick time or vacation days and they treat you like you’re green and the rumors are true. Artco deckhands don’t know much about decking. 
ADM,Operator,1,"Not great, not terrible. Upper management is awful and aloof but local management seems to care at least a lil bit. Recommend working here if you need money"
ADM,Supervisor,2,"Have not enjoyed time working here. Company is run well, but local plant is not. Benefits are aweful, pay can be good if you fight for your pay up front."
ADM,Operator One,3,What is the best part of working at the company?The work is not that hard and the pay is great What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Swing shift one week you're on third one week you're on seconds in one week you are on first no time for your children if you have small childrenWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?It is Multicultural and the environment is okay you learn to take the good with the badWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Loading trucks and rail cars as well as washing rail cars getting samples and ceiling the real cars up to be shipped out
ADM,Operations Manager,5,"Great first job out off college, they tend to use and abuse new hire managers, like working night shift shoveling rotten corn out of rail cars etc. 24 hours on call most of the time after that. The job was stable for awhile but heavily dependent on global grain prices. If there is a bad year there is a lottery system for lay offs. I made it 6 years before the lottery system pulled my number. "
ADM,Utility,3,good job if your looking for hours to make money but like with any plant you will always be on call for over time so some times it feels like you live there. overall solid place to make some money 
ADM,Analista de Processos Sênior,2,"Organizational climate Very Bombons Benefits.Management needs to be more senior, a very inexperienced team. It has a restaurant in the company and good food."
ADM,Mechanic,3,Good co-workers. Bad environment. Constant wear and tear on your body. The work is okay but I don’t like working 16 hour shifts and it happens out of no where. Honestly if you love to work your life away for a factory it’s the place for you.
ADM,Machine Operator,3,They bought it Deerland and ruined it. The company is good to work for in it's self but management is awful. Everyone and I mean everyone is looking for other work because they never have enough employees and they still want the work done. The insurance sucks. The pay also sucks. That's the main reason why people are always leaving plus you feel like you're taken advantage of. 
ADM,Operador de Produção I,3,Pleasant company to work ... but there is exclusion and racism .. indirect
ADM,Operator,2,"Management will do anything in their power to prevent anyone they aren't friends with to grow their career, they will also belittle and call employees below them stupid.  The pay is decent but you will always work a rotating 12 hour shift and get blamed for managements mistakes and incompetence.  The superintendent will also tell you your easily replaceable and to quit if you don't like something. But just remember we're a family here. "
ADM,Production Worker,2,"ADM was one of the higher paying jobs in valdosta at one point. That is no longer the case, needs people that want to do a better job communicating with workers and actually trying to connect with team members. "
ADM,Site Operative,3,"4 on 4 off shift pattern, with plenty of available overtime means you can earn well above starting salary. Role mainly covers different areas of operation for out of normal business hours."
ADM,Manager,3,The company struggles with poor strategic direction and a lack of alignment. Communication up and down the management change is poor.. Benefits are generally good. Culture of focus on how much it costs with not as much regard for people. Work hours can be long. Hardest part of the job is managing expectations of levels above. Pay is all over the map.
ADM,NA,5,Can work lots of hours and lots of overtime available. Benefits are really good. Management team is always there and willing to help. The overtime is good but requires you to work all shifts.
ADM,Inventarios,5,"What is the best thing to work in the company? Everything, salary and environmentThe company? Inclusive, accurate and safe .. How is a typical day for you in the company? ..............................."
ADM,Utility Operator,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits if you can even get a day off to utilize them.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management. Nepotism and favoritism. A Lot of affairs and quid quo pro type of transactions.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic. Most employees who work there are only there for a quick check. They do not care... And the employees that care are often overlooked and mistreated What is a typical day like for you at the company?Easy work but management does not care about compliance just numbers in production.
ADM,Cleaner,1,"The worst experience ever was working at a place that felt like a daycare. Everyone seemed to want to fight, argue, and talk negatively. Despite putting in a lot of effort, I ended up with a broken face in the hospital, almost losing my life. I rushed back to work before fully healing because I didn’t want to lose my job. Unfortunately, I was fired due to medical absences. I definitely wouldn’t recommend that place to anyone!"
ADM,Director of Operations,4,Great people staff and facilities nice cafeteria and fantastic benefits love meeting new people and staff I would recommend it to all to work there for you 
ADM,Packer,1,I worked here for 8 months. The coworkers and supervisors are very rude. Super strict for no reason. Temp workers only make 14 dollars an hour. I’ve had coworkers say rude things to me and management does not care about its employees. WON’T RECOMMEND
ADM,Senior Legal Counsel,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?The people were terrific to work with and the company provided significant opportunities for advancement.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Substantial volume of work with short timelines.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is professional, but aggressive.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work requests are received throughout the day with verying degrees of complexity or time constraints."
ADM,Miller,1,"A typical day is being overworked everyday working 2 weeks straight to have one day off to turn around and do it all over again. Don’t say you’re overworked and stressed out and need a weekend off and take a weekend off because you just get written up for it. Prepare to work twice as much and twice as hard as the managers due to them getting their weekends off no matter what. If you have problems or issues with equipment good luck getting answers from management even if they manage to answer no matter what the problem is or how serious it may be you’re told “it should be fine” and “ keep running we will look at it when we get there in the morning. “ for example a hot bearing on a rollstand that maintenance came and looked at due to it running a high temperature, maintenance instructed me to shut down if the case to the bearing reached 179 degrees which it did, I shut the system down called management and was told it should be fine and to continue production. No care for employees or their safety some employees still can’t access safety equipment from vending machine and management has been notified multiple times and still can’t access basic PPE such as gloves, earplugs and safety glasses. This company fools you with the pay because it’s not even close to worth it better off at any other plant then ADM they at least have a structure where you get days off"
ADM,Miller,1,Production is a priority! Your mental well being isn't.  Communication is nonexistent! If you want to know if you work this weekend wait until Friday & good luck getting the day off if you had something planned. So if you don't value your time & just need a paycheck not a bad place. Insurance sucks. If you have a safety issue or concerns just go talk to a wall at least you will keep some of your dignity.
ADM,Merchandiser,4,Workloads don't exceed limits. Trainings could be better. Overall understanding management when things get tough. HR could use some work. Takes forever to figure out and manage benefits. 
ADM,Encarregado Administrativo Operacional,5,"What is the best part of working in the company? A lot of learning and great benefits, some friends. What is the most stressful part of work in the company? Indirect managers are very unable to assume such a function.They do not know and do not want to learn what actually is their function leaving the employee below him overloaded what the environment and the work culture in the company are like? Need to improve a lot in practice.Because in theory is very fluent. How is a typical day for you in the company?Commitment and loyalty to perform tasks."
ADM,Lead Operator,1,It's very demanding both physically and mentally. Extremely hot and dirty work. And during COVID no compensation for the danger we had to work regardless. The managers are horrible I dislike this company very much 
ADM,Coverter operator,2,Seems like there is always a shift doing more than another but the ones who do most work get treated unfairly. While they play favoritism with the employees which they are fond with.
ADM,Bulk Loader,4,Competitive pay in small town makes it hard to find a good reason to leave. Slow work flow in spring and summer can make those days feel real long. Good benefits 
ADM,Operador de tombador,5,"The company is top, works quietly without running, and is well regarded by superiors"
ADM,Agronomist ,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Terrible company, management doesn’t even understand the roles they supervise. It’s a company full of dreamers not doers from top to bottom. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with incompetent co-workers"
ADM,Machine Operator,1,"Job is hot, loud and mundane. Rather slow paced and gets tedious with the long hours. Management doesn't really do much here and there are several people who don't do much work."
ADM,Dock Worker,5,Hard working job but if you stick around and work you will be compensated for it. My boss made the job.  If you get a good group of coworkers its not bad at all. 
ADM,Engineer,4,"Great first job for exposure to plant operations and project management. Culture varies widely based on plant, but in my experience colleagues were all helpful and they were the best part of the job. "
ADM,Inventory control,5,"Great benefits, good team work, weekends off, good training, easy to get along with everyone at work, having the option to work overtime if you would like to."
ADM,Maintenance Worker,2,"Fast paced, you don't trust anyone! Work place culture, daily backstabbing, people wanting to move up by sucking up to those who have no business being in a supervisory role! The hardest part, not knowing your fate on a daily basis, all rules don't apply the same to everyone."
ADM,Operations Manager,1,This place has little to no concern/respect for their employees.  This is a toxic and good  old boy culture and environment.  Look behind the curtain.
ADM,Maintenance Technician,1,Typical day of getting blamed for boss not having repair items inventoried. Union Maintenance dept being thrown in the mud for failures of salaried supervisor position. Tensions between union and ADM staff. Segregation entirely from offices to parking lots between the peasant union members and the first class salaried staff. Very disgusting workplace environment.
ADM,Plant Utility,1,"12 hours of dealing with operators that don't want to teach you anything. You'll self teach a lot.Management is professionalCulture here is horrendous, all from other operators in training able to not do their work (which falls onto you), harass you and get away with it; to operators being on their phones, watching the game during work hours, and gossip about you behind your back constantly. Operators tend to not tell you what's going on and then gets frustrated when something goes wrong. Hardest part of the job is definitely learning the plant. Most enjoyable part is learning new things ."
ADM,Accounting Analyst,3,"The pay and benefits are great but if you have a question about their antiquated systems, on how to do something, or just curious how something is done more often than not you won’t get answered or it’ll take forever to get an answer. But more often than not you get passed around until you give up and just wait to see if someone will answer you. Was the worst culture to work in and network. "
ADM,Feed loader,4,It was an ok job .management  wasn't too bad . Being a machine operator  wasn't to hard to lean easiest job was feed loader once you know what your doing
ADM,Senior Business Communications Specialist,1,They're super old school and the CEO doesn't allow any business practices that don't resembled the 1960's. They don't train their staff and expect those they hire to come in and be able to perform their role without any help or supervision. They'll give you good performance reviews and fire you with 0 notice. Saw this happen to a few people in my time there.
ADM,Senior Legal Counsel,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?The people were terrific to work with and the company provided significant opportunities for advancement.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Substantial volume of work with short timelines.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is professional, but aggressive.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work requests are received throughout the day with verying degrees of complexity or time constraints."
ADM,Operator/Forklift Driver,1,Horrible environment to work in hours are long with no idea at some plants when your day will be because of production schedule. Nepotism abounds with friends and family being hired not a friendly work place
ADM,tecnico en mantenimiento,1,"There is no salary increase, there is no motivation to the employee, lack of tools and spare parts, little personnel not there growth, lack of safety tools (footwear)"
ADM,Operator 1,2,The managers don’t care about you. They will pick on you and find reason to fire you. The Quincy locations are under an umbrella of corporate protection. Many foul practices. 
ADM,Lab Technician,3,"Top pay and benefits.  With the turnover, overtime can get overwhelming at times.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the automacy you get.  Attention to detail is necessary to be successful in this position."
ADM,Manager,1,"Antiquated management and systemsOld school HR policies such as no WFH and below-market benefits Below market salaries and poor pay increment, basically a retirement homeOutdated systems that no one is motivated to upgrade as they do the bare minimum Expats get double the pay of locals and are part of management’s inner circle"
ADM,Pretreat - General laborer ,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?It's an opportunity to meet and work with many awesome people.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?To me, I don't see any stress about the job because it's give time for a breaks What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It is a family oriented business- friendly enviroment- possibility of advancementWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Mostly is to clean and dust some machineries"
ADM,Analyst-Corn Processing,1,What is the best part of working at the company?ADM offered good pay and decent benefitsWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?They seemed to make the job more stressful than it needed to be. Working first Saturday of the month just to be able to get things done in the allotted time frame for accounting close periodWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?The culture was good until Archer Daniels and Midland hired CEO for millions while not giving raises to employees who had been there for yearsWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?I would like to point out no sick days were allowed. I even had to take a vacation days to go see a doctor or dentist
ADM,TRADE MARKETING,2,What is the best thing to work in the company? Reputation and name of the company worldHow is the environment and the work culture in the company? Is regular by not having support for the parent company in many processes. How is a typical day for you in the company? Assume responsibilities and structure processes totally from scratch.
ADM,Operator,2,"Short if any breaks,Learn on your own, very little assistance from trainers,2 weeks days, 2 weeks nightsTeam members and management pick on new guys,No help from management or hr when actual problems occur (men fighting, harassment etc)Great pay, Rough work."
ADM,Alcohol operator,1,"There is no work life balance, constant forced overtime, it’s union versus company and at the end of the day all the union workers are replaceable. If you die your job bid will be put up the very next day. The union insurance is amazing and the pay is great. 1/2 the management really doesn’t care about your safety and it’s grind grind grind ahead of everything else . 100% don’t recommend if you want to maintain a relationship with your family. You can easily pull 120k a year with the forced overtime if you don’t mind being at work more than home"
ADM,Operator,4,The pay is good however over the years corporate seem to not care who or how  the operations are ran. Its very scary nowadays. Swing shifts are not pleasant if your looking for straight shifts RUN. Not the place for you. Your pay can go up very quick depending on what you want to do.
ADM,Director Comercial,2,"It is the typical culture in which each of the areas is responsible only for themselves and the fault of everything to the others.There is no head leadership, the matrix structure generates very harmful internal competition."
ADM,Driver,3,Not a bad company it’s just certain aspects of it is frustrating. The communication of information to help you do your job is lacking and you have to hunt down the correct info.
ADM,Ejecutivo de Cuenta,2,"Excellent benefits and good salary vs. Heavy Labor Environment Market, excess work, lousy in internal processes and disorganization"
ADM,Técnico em segurança do trabalho sênior,5,"Corporate environment for learning performance, rugged EHS culture in everyday life, environment with high flow of operational demands."
ADM,Forklift Operator,2,"Supervision is not professional, they don't let you know your appreciated or that your doing a good job.  They pick and  choose who they wanna talk too. Rather than having meaningful conversations with all employees.  They will tell you one thing and not follow up with you.Benefits are good. Pay is also good. Just supervision could be a little more professional. "
ADM,Manager,4,Good pay decent benefits long hours and work life balance is not the best. Do your job and be available and you will do well. Inconsistent accountability.
ADM,Operator,4,good pay bad management was not a fan of the swings as they didn’t keep the patterns correctly  would constantly switch which day i was making it hairs to schedule things outside of work
ADM,operador 3,5,A great work environment where respect is part of the company's culture.
ADM,Production Operator,1,"Pay is good, benifits good. Completely awful and toxic work environment for all hourly employees. Double, sometimes triple standards for salary. Management has a huge nepotism and favoritism issue regardless of your knowledge of the plants and  operations equipment.  Don’t waste your time!"
Procter & Gamble,Sales Manager,5,A company with a strong training system and innovative capabilities that drive business growth through consumer-centric products and continuous organizational expansion.
Procter & Gamble,Gerente de Projetos,3,"Company with salaries above the market, a great place to learn and develop.Lack of quality of life, overwork compromises personal life.Week -day without time to leave.Work on weekends without extra time"
Procter & Gamble,Muy mal,1,I was working for them.They have hired Randstad that the staff takes them so as not to make anyone fixed.They call you loose days without any stability.But the worst thing is that they even call you at any time.They called me at 3-4 in the morning without warning to go to work that same morning.You can't live pending a phone ... They ask you for total availability at any time at any day of the week. It is a precarious work so that they do not offer you a fixed position ..
Procter & Gamble,Ingeniero de Procesos,3,"24/7 There is no rest, work Saturdays and Sundays day and night, you have to be available at all times, there is no extra time payment if you are not unionized"
Procter & Gamble,Technician,2,"The shifts are a 12+ hour day alternating days/nights. Breaks are never guaranteed because if there are problems with the equipment, breaks are few and far between. On a good day you will get sufficient breaks. If you are on a supportive team, you will get all the training you need if you are not, you are not trained and expected to do the dirty work. Very negative environment from management down to technicians. I have brought up concerns to management about some issues on my team and lack of training and it was never addressed. As long as the production is going well,  they don’t care about your concerns.  Results driven management. Training is available if your boss lets you sign up for it if they don’t, then you don’t get it. In order to get promoted, you have to chase people down to sign off your skill block and if they don’t have time, it doesn’t get done so then you don’t get promoted.  When first hired In orientation, they tell you how much opportunity to move around, change roles and  learn but once you get in your department, some departments do not allow transfers so it’s impossible to get out of a role that you are not a good fit for. Pay is decent. Holiday pay and time off is good but very long work days. "
Procter & Gamble,Account Manager,5,Could be an example of a perfect company in my view. I like company ethos and compensation is great. Worked there for 8 years in total after a transfer from a different country. Their recruitment is amazing - pick the best people
Procter & Gamble,Administrator,5,Awesome company with superior products especially cereal with tons of sugar to get you going in the morning if you don't drink coffee all the time and fun too especially the golf.
Procter & Gamble,Financial Analyst,5,"work environment is good, very competitive and kind colleagues, compensation is very good and work condition is ideal where there is work life balance and such"
Procter & Gamble,Brand Manager,5,"It was my real, first professional job I got and it was a wonderful experience! It was the place I was welcomed into a great work culture and the people around me were great to work with!"
Procter & Gamble,Software Engineer Intern,4,"Great company and culture, but lacks technical rigor. Many have a decent technical experience, but leans more towards business-style positions rather than tech"
Procter & Gamble,Lab Manager,4,"P&G has a very strong internal culture that stretches across facilities. The good part is that you know what you're getting, the bad part is that the employee benefits are slowly eroding. "
Procter & Gamble,Product Supply Engineer,3,"As an employee with an engineering background, i never thought i’d be working manually— oiling up machines, fixing defects on old machines. The chance of you getting out of the production line is too small, you’ll end up attending to machine breakdowns for the rest of your life. Benefits were good but the physical work was too much. "
Procter & Gamble,Préparateur de commandes,4,"At Kheops, as a coaster, I noticed that many spend a lot of time on their phone, especially those on permanent contracts.It seems that if you have good relations with the chefs or that you are a little flattering, you are more likely to stay in place for a long time.Unfortunately, those who try to report problems or provide solutions to superiors see no change.This creates an environment where it is preferable to remain discreet and follow the movement rather than speaking openly about problems. There is also a notable difference under working conditions between preparers and carists.Preparers seem to work constantly, while carists have more flexible conditions.This can cause tensions, especially when some benefit from bonuses simply because they have good relations with the chiefs, while others are left out. In terms of management, there is a lack of transparent leadership.For example, I observed chefs who spend a lot of time on their phone, sometimes even playing, which gives the impression that their priorities are not always aligned with those of employees.Improvements are possible in this area, and I hope that the company will be able to identify these problems to progress. Globally, it is an environment to avoid if you are looking for a workplace where equity and merit are valued.However, with changes in management, including better-More ..."
Procter & Gamble,Engineer,3,"i reached 5+ years in this company and resigned cuz i was exhausted and some workmates died cuz of covid. i see people who was successful, enjoyed their work, and stayed lifetime in the company. but saw people who resign asap, after a few mos, few years only. can be successful or stressful, up to you. ask around before accepting & applying cuz people have differences in experiences here. like other comments here, it is good and bad depends on you. some people liked the enviroment and some people did not like the politics & competition. good luck & it is not bad to try, it depends on you."
Procter & Gamble,Line Shift Leader,3,"They hire so many people with no experience in manufacturing, then put them in positions leading others. It is the blind leading the blind. Horrible work schedules."
Procter & Gamble,Plant Technician ,2,"Just to keep the line running if we have a stop fellow workers Don't take the time to show someone how they resolved the issue they want to get line up and running fast their worried about PR for the day, the hardest part is getting some training or help sometimes you work with lazy people who sit and look at their phone all day and teach nothing and the schedule is horrible days and nights no family time all you do is sleep.  Best part is the end of the day."
Procter & Gamble,Group Manager,5,Excellent culture at the work place . Give people early in career . One of the best managers . No sorry office politics. People support each other and healthy competition
Procter & Gamble,Finance analyst,5,you learn alot in the job but it can be very stressful. The work life balance is hard to maintain. The job has many benefits and is a good pay. The culture is good and people are very helpful.
Procter & Gamble,"Lima, OH",1,They do not train you right and expect you to just know what to do. Management does not follow the handbook and they don't really care about the employees.
Procter & Gamble,Research Assistant,2,"There is a reason why people refer to those from Procter and Gamble as ""proctoids."" If you plan to work here be prepared to be surrounded by many other proctoids- people who have no personality outside of doing their job as robotically as possible"
Procter & Gamble,Senior Engineering Manager,4,"For more technical advancements you should move on. Payment is fair, but not the best. If you are tech person - there is not much of deeply technical work - technical hard-core work is done by contractors "
Procter & Gamble,Sales Manager,5,A company with a strong training system and innovative capabilities that drive business growth through consumer-centric products and continuous organizational expansion.
Procter & Gamble,Senior Analyst,5,"Most managers are fantastic and supportive. Quite a bit of politics and layers, making it difficult to make quick decisions and get promoted. Great people, very smart and competitive. A lot of processes which can be annoying, but keeps everyone organized and on track."
Procter & Gamble,Plant Technician,5,Great pay & benefits with great work/life balance. This is a great company to work for and be proud of.  There is so much room to grow in the company.
Procter & Gamble,Line shift lead,1,"The hours and pay of this job are tough. Rapid rotating swing shift is hard. No all leadership is bad but in the culture they are building currently they are getting more and more strict. It was a fun job for years till they began firing people left and right. Some for valid reasons, some for small errors. Every workplace has policies for a reason, but unless you know the policies more than you know the laws your job stability is in jeprody. And the kicker is, policies at a site level are open to interpretation with no clear how or why, you can be doing the right thing for this company and they just want to part ways for a single mistyped word or date. The stress and physical damage the rapid rotating schedule does to a person is not worth it. Your chances of advancement are slim to none, even if you preform well, they will keep you on the rapid rotating schedule instead of letting you get a dayshift promotion and say it's because the buisness needs you more on the floor. This company is not as good of a place to work for as it leads on. It REALLY comes down to your leadership and most are too busy trying to save themselves from getting fired or getting their own promotions to actually help you. Good luck to those who work here. I hope they succeed. This job was great for years till they wanted to get more greedy and cult like with who stays and goes. "
Procter & Gamble,Technician Level 3,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?P&G allows technicians the freedom to improve their own performance and skills with specialized training. They also encourage employees to develop and improve the equipment they are selected to operate. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working a continental shift. 12 hours rotating. Week 1 Monday Tuesday days off Wednesday Thursday  nights Friday Saturday Sunday. Week 2 off Monday Tuesday then days Wednesday Thursday. Week 3 opposite of week 1 and week 4 opposite to week 2What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Everyone has a place and purpose. The company works via servant leadership. The leadership works for you. Whatever you need they’re there to support you. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Meet outgoing shift, meeting with teammates and leaders. Plan events for the day whether routine or unplanned. Start regular activities on the line. If work is related to an outage or breakdown in your area you’re responsible to schedule maintenance and contractors to repair and restart the line."
Procter & Gamble,Blois (41),5,"There is a mutual company, possibility of payment of sup or in receipt, bonus participation and profit -sharing ... Possibility of evolution, good business"
Procter & Gamble,Warehouse Associate,4,I personally hates it cause it’s so monotonous but if you like routine and overtime it’s for you. You get three weeks of paid training and then they send you off
Procter & Gamble,Operador de Produção,3,"Company with productive and dynamic workplace, good salary and benefits.Several responsibilities are assigned to employees such as machine owner, supply, operation, preventive and corrective maintenance, production planning, constant learning courses."
Procter & Gamble,Business Planner,5,"It’s a very friendly environment, you pick up areas of the business you never anticipated you would, and pick up a number of skills along the way. Heavy workload but the culture is supportive enough to cope with it"

Procter & Gamble,Plant Technician,3,"I'll be honest - most people who work in this position are here for the money, and it's plentiful if you keep your nose to the grindstone, find some allies and play your cards right in other ways.  The wages and benefits are fantastic.  But if it's not just about the money then you should really consider accepting a plant tech position here.  There are opportunities but it'll take awhile; and you need the above-mentioned allies to help you get there.  While some management is there for a very long time, it seems that the majority are swapped out every 2-4 years to move on to other posts and other locations.  HR is frustratingly difficult to work with and 99% of the time will refer you to corporate phone numbers for assistance.  Safety is drilled into your head - and rightly so - but there's a lot of ""do as I say, not as I do"" here.  They pile rules on top of rules on top of rules but overlook so many other things.  If you know any current employees, ask them why they like working there - guaranteed that you'll hear similar answers - most likely the money and benefits but anything else will be things that the company repeats on the regular.  Don't get me wrong - it's not a horrible place to work.  But if you want to make a difference and have a meaningful work life, this may not be the right place for you.  "
Procter & Gamble,Security Officer,3,It’s an okay company to work for the staff are generally friendly although there is always an occasional Karen. Beware though the company will openly get you excited and mention raises through out your employment let me advise you to only believe it when you see it. In my time there never seen it 
Procter & Gamble,Senior Financial Analyst,4,"Big salary increases for top performers, workload might be overwhelming depending on your team. Promotion may take a while. Very good employee benefits. Super great place to start a career. "
Procter & Gamble,Merchandiser,4,"It was a stable company, now they sold many brands, that made jobs be lost, they complied with the uniform, and were strict with the payment date"
Procter & Gamble,Expert Analyst,5,"Love working here. I spent 12 years in the company and enjoyed all roles I've been in. I love the managers, and all the people I worked with. I miss working here. "
Procter & Gamble,Technician,2,Terrible rotating schedule plus mandatory overtime gives you less than 24 hours to go from nights to days. Terrible work life balance. Teams are always short staffed. 
Procter & Gamble,Process Engineer,5,"Fair pay, longer hours, good people, a lot of growth, decent annual raises, annual bonus. Operations can be tough, but if you have a good manager it’s okay. "
Procter & Gamble,Marketing Specialist,3,"It’s a good company that will look well on your resume, especially if you are planning a career in marketing. However, be prepared to be managed by younger people who lack the experience driven by a diverse background as they were scouted by P&G right after university. "
Procter & Gamble,Product Supply Engineer,5,There are trainings and qualifications for new hires before doing the main job which is in operation and maintenance. All employees were friendly that you could ask for help whenever you don’t know things. 
Procter & Gamble,Logistics Specialist,4,its good place to start your carrer as you will follow the company path. Nice caffeteria and bonuses. People not so friendly thats why I left this company
Procter & Gamble,Sales Manager,5,A company with a strong training system and innovative capabilities that drive business growth through consumer-centric products and continuous organizational expansion.
Procter & Gamble,Brand Manager,5,"Supportive culture, a lot of things to learn, good pay & benefits especially in the early years (1-5ys), then it might become less competitive on salary. "
Procter & Gamble,Design Director,5,"Great corporate culture and smart people to work with. Good work life balance with much flexibility. Work based on trust, nobody will track your working hours, so individual need to be disciplined."
Procter & Gamble,Assistant Brand Manager,3,"Good pay, a company that is alluring to all the graduates of marketing degree, however, the experience of working there is not pleasant, usually overworked, most employees under pressure, quick-paced, but overall a very reputational company that adds credits to your resume. "
Procter & Gamble,Solid State Polymer Formulation Chemist,2,They would not renew my contract because they felt that I was not proficient enough at Excel.  They gave up on me. For a week or two I was giving all I had to learn Excel for them. Learning the Extrusion Request Excel procedures I could tell really was not that big a deal. If only they would have trained and taken some personal human interest then I would have learned their Excel within a matter of three or four months at most.(Maybe much less)!>I know the extent of my abilities and almost always succeed when I decide to do something. 
Procter & Gamble,Technician,1,"Very overwhelming and stressful, but if you can handle it good luck. Long hours, gym on site, cafeteria on site. A heavy disconnect between team and management, being told one minute you are doing great and then the next the management would say that you're making them look bad. It became very Unencourgaging, stressful each day. The stress would make me sick and you often get compared to peers, even if you have limitations. Overall I think that management needs to be more encouraging, instead of telling you that you should quit 4 months in..."
Procter & Gamble,Plant Technician,5,"Love my job. P&G offers great benefits - competitive pay, profit sharing, 401k, decent health insurance, disability pay, etc. Vacation time is good too. Start with 120 hours with the option of buying an additional 120. Get about 4 sick days a year too. Work is easy. Hardest thing, I'd say, is getting used to the rotational shift schedule. Not for everybody."
Procter & Gamble,Quality Inspector,4,What is the best part of working at the company?Getting to know the different products and watching it being made.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Making sure you getting the job done.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Productive and relaxing at the job.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Making the product and making sure it is correct.
Procter & Gamble,Warehouse Manager,5,"I worked for 7 years and is a good company to grow and learn. I had 5 different roles and in every one of them I had many challenges. What I like the most was they always emphasized in ‘doing the right thing’  and it was 100% true, which made me feel really comfortable working there. You will have many responsibilities and you will need to be very organized and align your expectations with your manager  if you like to have work life balance, because it’s a lot of work. "
Procter & Gamble,Plant Technician,2,"They have a culture of selecting all of managers from engineers. It’s almost like a non-written law.  I have seen people being with the company over 20 years that been downgraded from manager to mechanic and replaced with newbie engineers. This is a huge problem at a manufacturing plant. All these engineers didn’t do anything wrong. This is an upper management problem. They hire 20 years old people with no real job experience except internships to manage a team of 15. Obviously they don’t have the ability to do so. They don’t know how to communicate, how to manage time, operations, people and technicians pay the bills for this lack of abilities. Management uses this team managers as a communication device to micro-manage employees, decisions that will not be welcomed. As a result of this everybody including team managers have a high stress work environment.  My team lead was responsible for a site-wide software without any advanced computer knowledge. I offered to write a guideline about this software but it was rejected because I’m not an engineer. That’s the level of ignorance. You expect to do what you need to until you retire and don’t ask for anything further."
Procter & Gamble,Maintenance Planner,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Pay and benefits are quite good and the company hires excellent quality peopleWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Step up cards, Skill matrixes, and Integrated work systems make everything about the job stressful. You cannot simply do your job. You are forced to innovate What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The facility is clean and well kept. The management means well but they have no earthly idea how to implement their ideas. Many times the techs are instructed to "" do the thing"" but not given any further guidance What is a typical day like for you at the company?A unique blend of stress and boredom."
Procter & Gamble,Production Worker,5,"Procter and Gamble is a good company to work for. Have the opportunity to meet new people from different countries. Procter and Gamble was a different experience for me. I learned different jobs that I didn’t know how to do before.  I learned how to load and unload the machine, also learn how to load the line as well."
Procter & Gamble,Product Supply Engineer,2,"They always push the Product Supply Engineers to work hard but they don't respect or listens to your concern. You will feel like you are always being watched and one wrong move that you do they will treat you different already.  The management style in one module is very bad. You will feel unmotivated when the management is being biased with other employee. It's only looks good because it is very big company, but once you work here as a rank and file employee you will understand the politics in the management especially in one certain department. They also deduct to your payroll if you have minimal defect on the property that they've lend you even though they already give you that certain thing already broken."
Procter & Gamble,General Laborer,5,"The job is easy, just tedious work. If you don’t mind being on your feet 12 hours, it’s not a bad job. Good people, good benefits, management is ok. Mechanically inclined will help tremendously. "
Procter & Gamble,Service operation,5,"There are defined objectives and you will always have teams that help you achieve them.You have complete decision making, your manager helps you grow without suffocating, the benefits are incredible and the flexibility of schedules allows you to have a great balance of life and career.Here the atmosphere is good, the very well offices, it is a dream"
Procter & Gamble,Accounts Payable Clerk,5,"It was a great place to work, until I had a family. Rotating shifts is hard enough when you don’t have a family. We were like family there. I advanced quickly as they have an interview process that checks your qualifications. "
Procter & Gamble,KAM Jr,3,They were pretty good they teach and prepare you.All the time there are opportunities to grow and your bosses are good and reasonable with you.The days are reasonable schedule
Procter & Gamble,Family care tugger driver,1,The hardest part about the job is being around people that don't care about your good work enthusiasm and the fact that they just don't care and they will try there hardest to find a reason to write you up or get you fired
Procter & Gamble,Production Associate,2,"The culture is like a cult. Favoritism and cherry picking rules. Lots of sneaky backstabbing people and bigots. They act like safety is first on the front, but behind the scenes they care more about production. Wild goose chase to get signed off on things for raises. You couldn’t pay me enough to go back there. "
Procter & Gamble,Operador De Produccion,5,"Procter and Gamble is an excellent company, the benefits are very good, the balance between personal and work life is very good, job stability as in a few sides, very competitive Don wages despite the fact that it works under mu has pressure."
Procter & Gamble,European Tax Compliance Accountant,5,"Great place to work, benefits are very good. Team culture is fun and professional. Everyone is VERY supportive and always offers a helping hand when needed. Career progression opportunities if you want them. WFH policy is 2 days in the office 3 days at home. Pay could be better."
Procter & Gamble,Sales Manager,5,A company with a strong training system and innovative capabilities that drive business growth through consumer-centric products and continuous organizational expansion.
Procter & Gamble,Process Owner,3,"Prepare yourself for the workload as it will be very heavy and even though it is not recommended that you will do overtime, you will because of works."
Procter & Gamble,Plant Technician,1,It’s a great company to work for but in order to advance and get a higher salary you must jump through hoops to do so! Plus you’d better like working shift work too! They work a 2-2-3 12 hour shift! It’s okay for the younger generation but I wouldn’t recommend it if you’re older!
Procter & Gamble,Technician,1,"Most enjoyable part is walking out the gate to go homeNot worth the aggravation Culture is very negative, constant high school like behaviors with drama"
Procter & Gamble,Administrador,5,"Working at Procter & Gamble is an enriching experience and full of opportunities.The company is known for its commitment to innovation, which provides its employees with the possibility of developing avant -garde projects in a dynamic environment.In addition, P&G promotes an inclusive and collaborative work environment, where diversity and personal growth are valued."
Procter & Gamble,R&D Intern,3,"Job was stable, enjoyable and engaging. However some managers can be particularly snooty and demanding of the interns that are there. I can hardly blame them, as many went through the same demanding experience and feel the same should be experienced by the new batch coming in.Some individuals were very ambitious in their roles, putting in 10 hour work days, others seemed to do a whole load of nothing until 3'o'clock came around and then they would ""work from home"".Bear in mind I did this stint during COVID, so the atmosphere may have changed. The individuals I know that work there are very happy, they get paid well, and the pension is very well compensated."
Procter & Gamble,Business Planning Manager,5,"What can I say? You work with a lot of smart people, pay's ok but the office is really out of the way. You get a lot of responsibility from very early on, but you also learn a lot while there."
Procter & Gamble,OPERATOR,1,"Racist people will never contribute a good impact for others. As a professional and well experienced in production team for 6 years, work ethics benefits not only as individual but also other people who are open minded.  It will enhance and build strong confidence to work with positive mindset and good working environment."
Procter & Gamble,Production Worker,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?They have good benefits. They pay really well.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?They can force you to come in 4 hours early, four hours late and force you to work weekends. They  constantly switch management around. Each new manager changes things and disrupts everything.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's clean for the most part. As for culture, they don't hold people accountable for their mistakes and the managers constantly change things so you never know what's expected of you.What is a typical day like for you at the company?The job itself is not hard. You run equipment that either makes toothbrushes and packs them into boxes."
Procter & Gamble,Leader Government Relations and Public Policy,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Work Life Balance and Learning curve What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Nothing, during my tenure at P&G it found that this is one of the best places to work. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Inclusive, protected and progressive with evolving  What is a typical day like for you at the company?Fun but  productive at the at the same time."
Procter & Gamble,Senior Engineer,5,"Typically start day shift at 8:00 amMonday through Friday only, some overtime requiredI learned about industrial level product manufacturing, time management, leadership skills, communication skills, project management, training skills, cross cultural management"
Procter & Gamble,Finance Analyst,4,P&G was one of the best company that I have worked for. Great people and leadership team. A lot of great benefits as well but the base salary was not that competitive. Fresh grad are commonly hired as manager so it can be a challenge for the team sometime.
Procter & Gamble,Team Leader,4,Excellent training plan in which each person decides as far as they want to get a typical work day.
Procter & Gamble,Project Engineer Consultant,4,"I was a short-term project engineer, and I enjoyed the project and my manager. It was a struggle to connect with very provincial QA department. In all my prior and later experience, I interface with QA very well, as that has nearly always encompassed much of my job. The QA manager at PG had seemingly no QA experience outside of her PG employment, so needless to say, their procedures were very non-standard and not meeting cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Processes). It was difficult to read this person's mind and know what she wanted when virtually nothing was documented. There was no Quality Manual or written QA department SOP's of any kind shared with me. This was some time ago, so I hope improvements were made, or that some leader with a more collaborative personality overtook this critical role."
Procter & Gamble,Field Service Technician,4,"I only wish the matter of training for those with little to no prior experience was more systematized, structured and longer then a few days, there is so much theoretical knowledge you need to absorb in order to start building meaningful skills and expertise based on theory."
Procter & Gamble,営業、企画、人事、管理,5,"Working at this company, please tell me what you think is the best.(2) There is a flat relationship with the boss without a faction.Working at this company, please tell me what you feel most stressed.Please tell us about the company's work environment and culture.Please tell me the flow of the day of the working day at this company. Private preparation team meeting visit sale Next step setting Next preparation"
Procter & Gamble,HR Manager,5,It was a very good workplace. We had good compensation. So many benefits. Really learned a lot from everyone I met there. Good work balance also since I was able to do the things I like.
Procter & Gamble,Técnico Eletrônico,4,Very good salary compared to other companies. But a lot of bureaucracy for simple activities in general is an environment of working. Opportunity of growth.
Procter & Gamble,Production Worker,5,"If I had a chance, I’d return and work for them again if I had the opportunity I work from them again I have nothing negative to say about this work environment"
Procter & Gamble,Supply Chain Manager,5,Really good place to work. Good managers. Good team. Incredible work experience and culture. You get to learn and work at the same time. I love it there
Procter & Gamble,Initiative Operations Leader,3,"Competitive benefits, low internal growth probability"
Procter & Gamble,Sales Manager,5,A company with a strong training system and innovative capabilities that drive business growth through consumer-centric products and continuous organizational expansion.
Procter & Gamble,Associate,5,Great way to start your career as a fresh grad. Work life balance depends on the role and function. People are smart and this fact inspires you to do your best as well
Procter & Gamble,Manufacturing Process Engineer,5,Good culture of encouraging young engineers to work in manufacturing and follow their passion right from college. Encourages people to move around and try different roles
Procter & Gamble,Logistics Coordinator,5,"Good salary, excellent package, excellent colleagues, the best experience i had in my life as an employee (left to create my entreprise). Lot of advantages in terms of quality of life at work. The management is human oriented and the objectives were reached with motivation and happiness. A big family ! "
Procter & Gamble,Administrative Assistant,1,Many departments are yte-washed into thinking they have diversity and yet they would take way one’s job roles or duties after one mistake and act rebellious towards you when you are trying your best. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY. STAY AWAY MAIN OFFICE IF POSSIBLE. 
Procter & Gamble,Social Media Executive,5,Management is good. You will learn lot. Team members are supportive.Career growth is the best here. Supportive team leader.                            
Procter & Gamble,Senior Data Engineer,2,"If you decide to work there, negotiate the best salary.I advise you to use the employer as he uses employees - less work, more money, more time for himself.Use chatgpt and have fun.In this way you will achieve balance and happiness."
Procter & Gamble,Cybersecurity IT/OT Systems Admin,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?All benefits are the same when you start, you don't have to be a manager to purchase  company stock shares like AmazonWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?You are expected to do at least 3 roles in one and have the work completed yesterday.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful and make it work with the least amount of resources.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful managers use intimidation and interrogation in their unpleasant meetings.  They micromanage you to the max."
Procter & Gamble,Team leader/PE/QA/ Education Training leader/Process Coach ,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Everyone’s input is encouraged and welcomed. Work as a team not individually.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?At times keeping lines and equipment running.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?People are treated as equals and respected.
Procter & Gamble,Business Planning,4,The best professional work experience.Incredibly bureaucratic and political for career movements.Very good job remuneration
Procter & Gamble,Nigeria Imports Leader,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?The freedom for employees to express themselves without fear and be creative in the roles.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The most stressful part we’re the long process it took to get approvals for tasks and projects that needed to be executed swiftly. This often led to competitions overtaking us in bringing new innovations to the market.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Based on my experience, P&G was the only company in Nigeria where the safety and wellbeing of employees were taken very serious and considered above the interests of the companyWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?A typical day was fun in the office. Even though the work could be tedious most times, the conducive work environment made it easy for employees to go through the day in pleasant manners"
Procter & Gamble,Technician,1,You'll be treated poorly by people who don't care. They preach safety and will still run you into the ground making unsafe work environments. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
Procter & Gamble,Técnico Superior,5,"What is the best thing to work in the company? Benefits, link areas, bosses, extra hours, what is the most stressful of working in the company? Only the workload, but it is in reduced times and days, it is compensatedWith other things, how is the environment and work culture in the company? They have a lot of culture in general, they teach you many work and personal things, you have a lot, you look at your goals, you strategies how to handle staff, correct mistakes and you are as empathic as possible"
Procter & Gamble,Process Specialist (Technician),2,"Quite a Rigid pathway structure that may be quite outdated from the standpoint of building a lifelong career and learning on the job;  there are 2 types of pre-destined pathways, one for technicians, one for managers. I find that is easy to get Pigeonholed into one . Manager pathway gets better recognition from the company and higher-up levels , including easier to get things done and fast-track, than the technician pathway, although technician pathway does more of the hands-on work.  Not easy to switch tracks.  Local office seems to have limited say over such implementations, and mainly toes the line when any feedback or suggestion is brought up.  Quite a fair amount of bureaucracy.  "
Procter & Gamble,Line Shift Leader,4,"As a line tech, most of my day was spent troubleshooting and unloading raw materials. Leadership typically leaves you alone unless you or they need something. The company is very hands-off usually. No micromanaging. Depending on the dept, expect to either be inside all 12 hours, or outside all 12 hours. "
Procter & Gamble,Technician,5,"Interesting place to work, always something to learn.  A lot of promotion opportunities.  Plenty of chance at overtime if wanted.  Can also travel if interested."
Procter & Gamble,Commercial Operations & Solutions Analyst,4,"In P&G, the work culture is excellent, promoting a collaborative and positive environment.However, vertical growth within the company can be a slow process, which can be a challenge for those who seek to move forward quickly in their professional career."
Procter & Gamble,Customer Service Advisor,3,"Working for Procter & Gamble (P&G) is a highly rewarding experience characterized by a dynamic work environment and a strong focus on innovation.

Procter & Gamble,Warehouse Technician/Forklift Operator,1,there are some good leadership within the company but overall super toxic and stressful environment leadership fraternizes with their employees the amount of stress i endured due to leadership harassment my last 2 to 3 years of employment with the company caused significant anxiety and health issues.
Procter & Gamble,Category Specialist,3,"Got stuck in the role, not for me. People were nice but staid. Hard to move out of the position, and there was not encouragement to do so. Underpaid for role"
Raytheon,Associate Technical Support Engineer,4,A nice fast-paced type of job with great people to work with as well as great management who cares about work balance life.
Raytheon,Supply Chain,2,"Raytheon is an excellent company to work for, the people are amazing, and what they do and who they support is why I've worked there as long as I had. Unfortunately hard work, dedication, over-time, proven results and a constant strive for success isn't recognized by management or HR. You will not be rewarded, compensated properly, and under valued. A family friend told me the only way to make money at Raytheon is to leave and come back, and that's true. They will pay more money for an outside hire to come in and do the same job you're doing, or if you apply within to advance, they'll under cut you and try to justify it saying they can't exceed granting you a 10%+ raise. When it's not a raise. It's a new position. New pay grade. But an outside hire will come in for that same job and make $20k more than what they'll offer you."
Raytheon,Planning Analyst,5,"As with any large corporation, especially within the realm of defense contracting, there will be displeasures inherent with the work itself - namely a lot of bureaucracy and red tape. If you overlook these things - the work itself is fascinating, job security is as good as you'll find, and the people and leadership are, for the most-part, great to work with."
Raytheon,Software Engineer,4,"I always felt valued at Raytheon. During my 3 years there I never once heard about an abusive manager or drama in any capacity. Pay is good and my experience with management was 100% positive. The building I worked in was very depressing however, dull gray and washed out tan cubicles as far as the eye can see. You can definitely rise to higher positions at Raytheon as it was something I routinely found with my own career as well as others. A lot of people work here their entire lives and I don't blame them. It is very comfortable and stable. However, you might have work and search for a few years to really find a project that excites you. "
Raytheon,Coordinator,3,"RTX is a company obsessively driven by metrics with never ending updates to policies, programs and procedures. Other than that, the pay and benefits are ok and you get to work with some very professional and competent people."
Raytheon,Mechanical Design Engineer,2,"Projects just get handed off with little information. Up to you to pester people for their input/approvals. No clear objects, just work until something hot comes up then its rush rush rush."
Raytheon,Calibration Technician,5,What is the best part of working at the company?B EST work ever. All over the plant What is the most stressful part about working at the company?People are the problem  the company are racist all over the places What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Metrology technician cables harness mechanical work What is a typical day like for you at the company?Good work for the company  all bosses are bad for the people
Raytheon,Senior Cyber Security Engineer,1,"After 3 different positions in Raytheon/RTX and 7 years here are my thoughts... benefits are suffering and the only way to get paid more is to move externally, then come back to the company. Raytheon's old culture has been decimated due to the many re-orgs and the merger of UTC. Management says that they want to be a good culture, but their actions are lacking severely. Apply somewhere else, things are going down hill   "
Raytheon,Mechanical Engineer,4,Coworkers are (mostly) pretty professional and treat each other with respect. Lots of engineering talent. People leaders tend to care about your well being. 
Raytheon,Machinist,5,Nice place to work great union keeps the pay and benefits good   worked there for over four years. Management is as bad as normal very little communication 
Raytheon,Senior Technical Training Specialist,2,"This company is all about pay inequality.  There should be a nationwide union that could stick it to the corporate and upper management.  Employees are paid crumbs compared to what corporate and upper management makes.  I worked there for over decade and it shows that they do not care about the people.  They care about profits and share holders more than they do their own employees.  Typical days for the office I worked at would start when there is no daylight outside in the morning and end when there is no daylight outside in the evening.  The workplace culture is toxic everyone is out to get everyone and it is dog eat dog.  The hardest part of the job is going on multiple business travel trips and being away from family.  I never enjoyed working there.  They like to lay off people due to ""Program Needs"" without even fighting to keep the essential employees.  True yellow belly cowards they are.  I highly recommend if you work for Raytheon to find employment elsewhere because you will get compensated more and get the recognition earned."
Raytheon,Planner,4,The best place that I’ve ever worked. I don’t have any complaints. The managers are informative and take time to teach. I was always informed of changes prior to implementation.
Raytheon,Financial Analyst,2,"Pay is competitive and offered overtime, but between the extremely long hours and weekend work it wasn’t possible to have any work life balance while I was there "
Raytheon,Senior Production Specialist ,5,It was a productive and fun place to work. Great health care benefits for the family. Always acknowledge you at review time for the work you put in for the company. 
Raytheon,Assembly / production/test ,5,I learned so many things and I am so familiar with everyone who were work with me If you have a will power for do anything you can do everything with learning so I loved my work and I worked with honesty and accountability.
Raytheon,Logistics Management Analyst,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Leadership, Growth, and Fellow Personnel (Teammates)What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Nothing, fellow teammates and leaders are willing to provide valuable advice and lending of their experience, skills and overall expertiseWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Overall, very good conditions! What is a typical day like for you at the company?Leader's briefings busy accomplishing tasks in support of their (internal, international) customers"
Raytheon,Tooling Engineer,4,"Raytheon is a world class company.  They went through a merger with United Technologies and that changed some polices which wasn't ideal, but it's still a great company.  It really depends on what group you get into and the work is definitely there if you want it.  There are lots of opportunities to learn and grow.  Company culture was a little lacking and employees, myself included, felt we weren't compensated enough with a high enough salary.  We often got low-balled and given bad raises."
Raytheon,Program Analyst,4,first job and was lucky with my team. great mentors but definitely not everywhere. some teams micromanage but mines was great. pick wisely during the interview
Raytheon,Wafer Fab Technician/QA inspector/Supervisor,5,"I work for Raytheon for 18 years. Great environment, great learning experience, great onboarding and training.  Nothing bad to say. I would recommend to anyone. "
Raytheon,Sr. Program Manager,1,"Since merger, it’s like the Wild West of bad management and ridiculous decisions. Terrible company - stay away if you can help it. The company is a good-ol’-boy’s network. "
Raytheon,IT Analyst,3,"Lots of constant company restructuring and project layoffs. Lots of work to keep busbut not enough resources to get things accomplished. Lots of meetings,  good opportunity to network with everyone. "
Raytheon,Associate Technical Support Engineer,4,A nice fast-paced type of job with great people to work with as well as great management who cares about work balance life.
Raytheon,Principal Engineer,3,"Your work assignment depends completely upon timing, as to what warm body is available when a task opens up. If you are winding down on your current task, or had the project canceled you often need to go 'find' your own work. No work is done without a charge number to charge to a contract or project."
Raytheon,Assembler,5,Good union job with productive in work place and room for growth in both salary and job position. There are flexible work schedules for company workers. 
Raytheon,Systems Engineer,3,"fun when there are programs available to work on. otherwise, you have to wait around (sometimes months) until either your manager or you find other available work. company has been making changes like enforcing RTO and 401k contributions. seems very unstable lately. "
Raytheon,Director of Human Resources,3,"This is an old company with old systems. The people were good, hardworking individuals who did their best to make things work. Change can be a challenge.."
Raytheon,Sr. Software Engineer,5,"Good benefits but this is Good Place to retire, not progress. People are laid back, every hour is counted. The work is competitive, but old employees are a hard nut to crack."
Raytheon,Support Member Technical Staff/Site Security Specialist    ,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Gaining the knowledge of the security process for clearance processingWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?it was contracted work so it did not last but two yearsWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?It was somewhat warm, and helpful when needed to beWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Handled the personnel security clearance life cycle, to include processing initial requests for clearance/access, crossovers, terminations, badge renewals, reporting requirements, and program required relevant security briefings and debriefings; manage the cleared personnel listing, and maintain accurate clearance database information; such as to provide general security guidance, investigate infractions and complaints, maintain security education and awareness initiatives, and ensure personnel adhere to security policies."
Raytheon,Mechanical Engineer,4,Great place to start a career. Typical big defense company with the expected pros and cons. Your experience is very dependent on your program/section 
Raytheon,"Chantilly, VA",1,"What is the best part of working at the company?There wasn’t a best part, it was awful.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Terrible leadership, girl cliques at the executive level that existed to keep other women down, and senior leaders who were aware and didn’t address it. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic, hostile, stressful, unhealthyWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Get to work around 8:30, get yelled at for something I didn’t do, do an 8 hour day, get email from leadership (who didn’t work on site or come to any meetings) telling us we had done something wrong, work another 2-3 hours, go home exhausted and defeated."
Raytheon,Principal Analyst,3,980 available and modified time is a perk. Good employees don’t get promoted in timely manner. Pile more work and multiple roles on you if you do a good job while others do a lot less. 
Raytheon,Senior Systems Administrator,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Poor management you do not get promoted for going above and beyond. The people getting promoted exaggerate . No honest onsite supervisor employees cheating on time. It’s going downhill.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?People getting promoted who don’t work.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Hostile work environment  poor management What is a typical day like for you at the company?Supervisor favoring there friends so they don’t show up for work.

Raytheon,Principal Analyst,5,Provided on job training to meet requirements. Lots of turnover with middle management creates challenges but still remains productive. Government authorizing officials that accredit systems are completely out of touch with reality and are not helpful whatsoever in their site visits.
Raytheon,"Andover, MA",1,"Used to be ok, but since the merger with UTC, Raytheon has become a lousy place to work. The recent mandates for working on site show the clueless nature of the management. Since the merger, our benefits have gotten worse, with the possible exception of tuition reimbursement. Everything else has been cut, restructured, etc. Despite what they say management doesn't care about employees."
Raytheon,Classroom Lead Instructor,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The people I worked with were the same as when Oklahoma University had the contract with the FAA. There was a change in upper-level management however, they were largely remotely located in Texas at the RTSC location. We were located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?We all had to submit resumes even though we may have been working there for years. Additionally, the FAA stopped hiring for 6 months or so. Most of the instructors were laid-off. I was one of them even though I was number four seniority. I went on Worker's Comp.They only kept instructors from nearby Kansas City and Fort Worth Centers. What they were doing I know not. When we were called back we again had to go through the resume hiring process. We were given several briefings on changes. The major one being we were to account for our time with codes. Classroom lead instructors had four codes to choose from depending on what it was we were doing.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work environment was quite pleasant. The culture was standard fare for a massive corporation that was engaged in providing training and training materials for the new customer, the Federal Aviation Administration.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Classroom instruction with breaks every 50 - 90 minutes. When in the labs supervising the simulation, assuring all instructors, ghost pilots and students on hand at their assigned positions."
Raytheon,"El Segundo, CA",3,"My day would start with a team meeting.  To be honest it was unnecessary because the person that is the front line leader is useless. Funny to me was the technicians and solder lady was full of knowledge. She would guide me through what I needed to know work wise.  The hardest part was dealing with the FLL, he’s rude and very condescending. The work is great learned a lot. To be honest their FLL was the worst part of my day.  So much miscommunication happens. The environment is very inclusive and they encourage learning. I miss the solder lady she’s very good and sweet, best of the best.  I’m glad I worked there. "
Raytheon,Test Engineer,5,It is a good place to work. My site is small and it's a close team. Work is a good pace. Great work life balance. Managers are hit and miss. I have a good one. Pay is good if you get a good starting salary. Don't expect crazy raises. 
Raytheon,Engineer,2,"Slow pace which makes you feel like you learn slowly too. Heavy nepotism higher up. Most technical workers are all severely underpaid for their value and there are zero raises apart from below inflation ""cost of living"" bumps. Overall, just a good place to get a year or two in and then find somewhere that actually values you. You can be directly responsible for making this place a lot of profit, but you will get nothing for it to keep you motivated and will slowly become less productive/caring until you fit the slow low productivity mould that majority of workers are in. "
Raytheon,Analyst,3,"Raytheon is a very old company that has a longstanding reputation and some very devoted, long-time, intelligent employees. The benefits are pretty standard (2 weeks vacation, 1 week sick, medical/dental/vision/retirement, etc.). That being said, the company acts like an old company. The technology is extremely outdated. When a new, bright mind comes in with inspiration and motivation to make changes, they wind up getting a job somewhere else (either internally or externally). This is because it is well-known and spoken within the company to move up, you need to move up and over. Meaning, promotions within your role are hard to come by. You'll need to move to another role (i.e. supply chain to finance) and up one payscale level. To give an example, one person I knew did the up and over job change and got a 12% raise after working for 1.5 years. Same person stayed in that role for 3 years and received a promotion they had to fight for with a 4% raise. Attrition is exceptionally rough at Raytheon as well. Part of the up and over is that employees leave the company for better paying roles for a few years and then come back for twice their original salary (or sometimes more!). There's no incentive to stay in your role or make longstanding improvements. On top of that, they advertised their ""Workplace of the Future"" system to bring in remote and hybrid employees. But, they've been removing the ability to work remote progressively until now they are saying all US Based remote work will be over come mid-October except for a handful of exceptions. This decision was made at a very - more..."
Raytheon,Procurement Manager,3,"Management is poorAggressive work environment Pay is good, company provides housing.Coworkers are not helpfulThe weather in Qatar is very hot.Some employees are powerful even more than management."
Raytheon,Senior Engineer,3,"Back in the time they were paying the highest salary, but after merger and high inflation the raises did not match the inflation and the rate of leaving people was high.Working smart and hard, being accountable and reliable do not count through the promotion and you should be loud to get promoted.Work and life balance is good. Health insurance is expensive for the family.It is a good place for doing a steady job but not for the career growth."
Raytheon,Associate Technical Support Engineer,4,A nice fast-paced type of job with great people to work with as well as great management who cares about work balance life.
Raytheon,"Senior Manager, Value Stream Lead",3,"Autonomy to conduct work, but typical corporate environment. The company only wants to see how much money it can make, not take care of employees well-being."

Director, Labor Relations",1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Nothing it’s a toxic mislead orgWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with ignorant managersWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic, micro managed and buracracticWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Same thing different day no involvement in decisions"
Raytheon,QA Analyst,3,"Stuck as temp for many years before being hired on. Management very selective and praising failure by giving awards and promotions. People were good, but also us against them between departments. Little to no consistent training due to mass departure for covid requirements. People there for many years got paid the same as new hires coming in. I did learn some skills, but it's not a place for growth at the site I was at."
Raytheon,Mechanical Engineer ,4,"It is a good place to work with good job security. Processes can make work take some time, but work is rewarding and making positive impact on the world."
Raytheon,Quality Inspector- Daro Airfoil Repair,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The people that I made friends with over the time and the experience and knowledge I gotWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Getting up early that’s it. And just having to have to meet the goal for the month What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It’s all works of life. They have no culture issue and the environment is prey good. It has AC and heat What is a typical day like for you at the company?Clock in. Make sure my safety glasses and everything is ready to go. Login in my computer and grab a part and start inspecting it
Raytheon,Talent Acquisition Specialist,3,Left because I knew more than my boss. People stay for pension and literally clock in and clock out. If you are in a leadership role from the outside employees who went for your position and did not get it will sabatoge you.

Everyone waiting to see when the next layoff occurs."
Raytheon,Engineer,4,"If you have a manager that is supportive, then your experience will probably be great. Most managers seem to be over worked and don’t have time to really manage their people. I don’t know if it’s a budget thing. Sometimes you can go months without even an email from your manager. Some employees are helpful, but it’s pretty cut throat, however that’s just the culture in corporate America. You must find jobs on your own, but if you network well, you should be good. "
Raytheon,Machine Operator,4,"Good pay benefits etc, too many bosses and poor management. Has 401k, health insurance, great pay. Vacation time is good and knowing what the product is can make you proud."
Raytheon,Engineer,5,Good place to learn industry and get skills. Bad place to stay 30 years. If you want to get a meaningful raise you’ll need to get an offer for them to match. 
Raytheon,Procurement Specialist,5,Great opportunities to collaborate with various work group and always opportunity to be challenged in the role with supportive leadership. I handled contracts that were supportive of international and domestic contracts to support military clients.
Raytheon,Production Chief,5,"Love my job and would def recommend the company. Only issue is that some teams are not balanced. Management is ok, lots of people close to retirement."
Raytheon,"Aurora, CO",4,"Very focused on Customer needs, but often swirl is not well managed.  When working towards focused goals, you are often provided the means to be successful.  However, too many meetings and too much swirl can interrupt progress.  "
Raytheon,Systems Engineer,3,"Great workplace if you want to get lost in the shuffle. Massive cubefarms and not a great opportunity to advance as a junior engineer. If you are slowing down as a senior engineer, then this might be your place."
Raytheon,Senior Systems Security Engineer II,2,"The engineers (my fellow teammates and individual from other teams) are good people.Management (from my team's Section Lead) all the way up the chain sucks.  Most of them seem to be incompetent - in over their heads.  They don't know what to do and how to actually solve/fix problems.  It's like they're kids on the playground playing pretend ... trying to figure it out.  So much incompetence.  Going to them for assistance is almost always practically useless.  We know it, they know it, they know we know it ... or, that might be giving them too much credit.  They probably aren't quite that wise.Part of the problem is they're lazy.  They encompass the Baby Boomers and Gen-X generations.  They took the higher positions so they wouldn't have to do real work - the technical work, problem-solving, etc.  Just play around with their Excel spreadsheets (numbers), Microsoft Project, and tell others what to do and check up on them even though they themselves don't know how to do the tasks."
Raytheon,Employee Life cycle Specialist,4,I did not hate my time there. It was a bit difficult to work there due to the size of the company. My main gripe is the lack of communication between departments. 
Raytheon,Software Engineer 2,4,"Largely luck of the draw when it comes to team and manager. You could reasonably hit the jackpot, or you could find a manager that threatens to scuttle your career. Pay is industry standard."
Raytheon,Senior Principal Systems Engineer,4,"I have two views of Raytheon Technologies, before the merger and after the merger.  Before the merger it was an outstanding place to work.  Great assignments with emphasis on strong engineering fundamentals.  I had several overseas assignments with challenging tasks.  Great times!  After the merger the environment shifted to more ""group hug"" meeting and agile work environments.  Management no longer seemed to be concerned with engineering.  Benefits changed which didn't sit well with older employees.  I would still recommend them, but you might not be there more than a few years.  Benefits are on average with others, but less than what they use to be.  Promotions are more difficult now, another reason to move on after a few years. "
Raytheon,Security Analyst,4,"Great coworkers and security culture when I worked there. The pay raises and promotions weren’t anything great, but I enjoyed working there and never had any issues!"
Raytheon,Manufacturing Engineering Co-op,4,"A place filled with tons of intellectual folks from ops to eng. Def an area that promoted careers growth, especially with a good team. Major con would be how tricky it can get things done while abiding all the rules."
Raytheon,Associate Technical Support Engineer,4,A nice fast-paced type of job with great people to work with as well as great management who cares about work balance life.
Raytheon,Software Engineer,4,"As another big defense company, there are a lot of projects to choose from and managers seem to try hard to keep employees happy. Usually work life balance is pretty good, and there are plenty of challenging systems being built at any time. However, the work skews toward electromechanical and embedded more than pure software"
Raytheon,Manufacturing Manager III / Senior Manager,3,"Raytheon, at this location, does a very poor job in understanding contract requirements which causes production delays.  I was told HUNDREDS of times that the schedule would get back on track in the factory.  While I agree it’s possible, if you don’t have FUNCTIONAL parts from suppliers, it’s impossible.  Employees work with legacy equipment and leadership doesn’t reinvest in older programs even if there is a good ROI.  There are often unreasonable demands placed on factory workers and factory floor leadership.  Senior Leadership teams make customers schedule promises but they do not understand the processes or timeline to complete product builds which causes the factory to experience failures.  Additionally, even if the factory is on or ahead of schedule, leadership will make promises to produce a higher count of product faster without understanding their are hard constraints (test equipment, ovens, tooling, etc)"
Raytheon,Sr. Test Technician,1,They will overwork and underpay you. I constantly worked like crazy and will not go back after they laid off me and half my team. Managers will write you up for no cause. They will expect you to sign them without a fight and it gets nasty if you try to fight them. This was the worst 2 years of my life.
Raytheon,Talent Acquisition Specialist-IIS,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Company has Great benefits, job stability.  Only draw back is it has an ""good ole boy"" company attitude, leadership clubWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Trying to get into the ""click"".  And figuring out who you can trustWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Good old boy, that they way we've always done it.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy but flexible, day goes pretty quickly"
Raytheon,Engineer,2,The growth path seems to mainly dependent on people in the higher ups that you know rather than your actual skill and experience.  Unfortunately most companies are run like that.
Raytheon,Senior Software Engineer,5,"The company is big enough that the culture is going to depend on which project you are a part of.  In general, you'll have some kind of project management system to interact with -- mostly some Agile variant -- in which there'll be a daily or multiple-times-per-week 'standup' meeting to cover short-term needs, plus one or two ~biweekly meetings to do planning, tasking, and reviewing the process overall.  There's a pretty open culture and if you need help figuring something out, there's usually resources available for you.  You generally know where you stand with everybody, have generally good guidance on what you should be doing and what ""done"" should look like.The most common work schedule is the ""9/80"" where you work 9 hour days and have every other Friday off.  This schedule is super convenient for a lot of reasons.  They're pretty reasonably flexible about the exact hours you choose to work, so long as it overlaps with 'core' hours.  On unclassified projects there is flexibility to work from home.  If you need to leave during the workday they offer ""modified time"" or ""mod time"" in which you have two weeks to work off the balance of extra time that you took off without having to take PTO -- a huge saver for me because there were plenty of times I needed to be off for a while on a given day."
Raytheon,Software Engineer,3,"If you don't become close friends with your supervisor, you're very likely to be stuck with ultra-low-visibility work and no advancement opportunities. If you're extroverted and good at self-promotion, you can succeed even if you're mediocre, but if you're competent you'll go pretty far...just don't expect to keep doing technical work. However, if you can relate to the feeling of being a nerd and doing the popular kids' homework for them, it can feel like that on steroids. If you're at all neurodivergent, be VERY cautious and keep your eyes open or you're likely to get stuffed in a metaphorical closet and forgotten about."
Raytheon,SUPPLY TECHNICIAN,5,"If I had a chance, I would definitely go back and work for Raytheon again.I have learned a lot working for Raytheon, gained so much experience work wise."
Raytheon,Material Program Manager,2,There were several reorganizations both company wide and department while I was working there. This left a lot of confusion for both managers and employees who were looking for more guidance. 
Raytheon,Intern,3,"Very good pay and benefits, especially for an intern. Cons are the company is constantly restructuring and cancelling programs, layoffs can happen any point. All HR related activities such as onboarding tend to be a months long process. "
Raytheon,Manager,4,Good company. Very challenging but lots of opportunities. Pay is decent but advocate for more or you will be paid less. Unique programs that will challenge.
Raytheon,Manufacturing Engineer,3,"Many different departments, roles, and programs, however not super easy to move around. Politics if you want to play (could be a pro or a con depending on your style). No two days alike, some exciting, some hurry up and wait. Not too difficult to coast. Not much advancement opportunity unless you’re fast tracked or willing to jump ship and come back. Be careful not to get chewed up and spit out!"
Raytheon,Associate Director,3,"I loved the work and people but the leadership and business unit mergers made it hard to build a name at the upper levels.  Accomplished Engineering Director, Chief Engineer, and Ph.D. holder in Systems Engineering, with a notable career at Raytheon Technologies. "
Raytheon,Recruiter,5,Enjoyed the culture and the work. Culture is amazing with ERG's and opportunities to give back to the community. Career growth was somewhat lacking. Would still be there had I not been laid off. 
Raytheon,FPGA Design Engineer,2,Management wasn't to caring of their engineers. Also felt micromanaged there from management. Would not recommend this location to anyone maybe other locations of Raytheon are better to work at. 
Raytheon,Field Service Technician,5,The position the challenged me to learn everything I possibly could. The other employees were very helpful and easy to contact if I had any issues that I was truly stuck on. 
Raytheon,Systems Engineer,3,Great time. Great growth opps if you want to pursue those. Amazing time with the leaderships althought the constant reorgs are getting confusing to keep up with .
Raytheon,Construction Manager,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Minimum interaction with the home office What is the most stressful part about working at the company?some of the locations can be challenging What is the work environment and culture like at the company?I work in the field, not in a office environmentWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Get up, bring the contractor in and get them working for the day. Try to fix any issues that comes up"
Raytheon,Software Engineer,4,"Good work life balance, opportunities to grow in your career, community involvement opportunities, mentorship and guidance. Applied online and was reached out by recruiter."
Raytheon,Production Tech,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Nothing is best part of working for this company What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Too much drama and politics  most stressful What is the work environment and culture like at the company?No work environment and culture at allWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?No typical day that like at all
Raytheon,Associate Technical Support Engineer,4,A nice fast-paced type of job with great people to work with as well as great management who cares about work balance life.
Raytheon,Reliability Engineer,1,What is the best part of working at the company?There was nothing special about working for Raytheon.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Getting laid off after 7 months of employment.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?My impression was a lack of understanding of actual work and anticipated work.  They didn't seem to have a good understanding of anticipated work.  Hence I got laid off after 7 months.
Raytheon,Software Engineer,4,"Overall been happy with the work, company has just gotten too big. I have had more section managers than years I've been at the company with all of the reorgs."
Raytheon,Material Handler/Forklift Operator,4,What is the best part of working at the company?I would say the benefits and all the bonuses What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The smallest thing can cost the most money and all it takes is one drop to get fired What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Busy sometimes I don't even get to take my breaksWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Delivering packages from building to building
Raytheon,Machinist ,4,It was a great place to work and learn new talents! Coworkers would always help each other out. Lots of great people. I got to work with a lot of different materials and make a lot of different prototype's. Management were very understanding and work life balance was great!
Raytheon,Senior Pricing Analyst,4,"Everyone is kind and helpful. Direct management is very responsive to question and concerns, and is willing to push back on unreasonable deadlines. Overall good place to work with decent work life balance."
Raytheon,Software Developer,4,Defense work is rewarding when you wanted to be.Pros: work life balance and ERG’sCons: upper management needs to understand engineering and lack of support from IT department and lack of training.
Raytheon,Event Management - Conference Center Coordinator,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?From the minute you start at Raytheon, there is an attention to providing you with the proper work space, equipment, training and shadow support.  The employees were helpful and positive.  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Once you are trained and up and running, you will be responsible for a multitude of responsibilities.  You need to figure out the best time management for yourself.  They are always expecting reports and solutions to the work in a timely fashion.  They keep training you on new aspects of the role in the company.   Great for employees who love growth and to be a part of the mission.  I always was learning something at Raytheon.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great work environment.  People are busy and also take time to answer your inquiries.  You are part of departmental meetings and share in the group.  There is always a project to volunteer for, such as ""cleaning up the Charles River"" or ""drives to collect for the soldiers"".  What is a typical day like for you at the company?Immediateldy log into the Help Desk.  Log into the phone system for the help desk and for the conference center scheduling software.  Greet visitors, provide office services or take catering orders for future meetings.  Attend meetings, perform occupancy walk of corporate, reports for management.  Mainly customer service and meeting planning."
Raytheon,Senior Systems Engineer,4,"I've personally enjoyed working at Raytheon Technologies. Every manager I've had has been supportive and caring. The work/life balance is pretty good, since you can basically work whichever hours fits best for you (as long as you don't miss meetings and ask for ridiculous hours like working at 12am-9am). The only downside is I feel like we're underpaid compared to the other defense companies in the area."
Raytheon,Janitor,3,Good work place and a lot of fun. People here and nice and make me want to go in everyday. The day to day can be pretty boring but the people within make it all worth it 
Raytheon,Feild Service Technician,4,I wish they didnt go through a contractor and hire directly but understand its a govt job but the contract they have currently is not really but raytheon is a good place.
Raytheon,Campus Programs Recruiter,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The team and managers are so supportive. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Having to hiring 1900 new entry level candidates in 4 months. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Relaxedinviting friendly helpfulWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?7:30 - 5pm with every other Friday off.

Raytheon,Electrical Engineer,5,"Great place to work, i have been here for over 5 years. I have worked in 3 different departments and all have been great learning experiences. Thank you"
Raytheon,Senior Training Systems Mgr,2,Cut throat environment Favoritism. Tendency hire hire hire the layoff layoff layoffVery little consideration or infrastructure to help employees that are experiencing life difficulties 
Raytheon,Information Systems Technologists,2,Plenty of company paid training provided to gain knowledge in different areas but only a select few people get a chance to work in those areas and advance their career.
Raytheon,Senior Software Engineer,4,"Had a good experience working for Raytheon. Loved my manager, but can be different experience depending on the team. Remote work, and was decently flexible. Layoffs came due to merger and there were many people on the chopping block. Not uncommon for this business from what I've heard."
Raytheon,Chief Engineer,5,"I really enjoy working here, they value my opinion, and have great benefits. Company really cares about the employees, to ensure success. Salaries could could be a bit higher."
Raytheon,Systems Engineer,3,"It was a good place for a new grad to start at, as you will learn very quickly how an engineering environment works. I would say do your time (~2 years) and then move on else where, otherwise you will be behind on learning, compensation, etc."
Raytheon,Systems Engineer,2,good work life balance but a lot of restrictions a lot of change happening every few months and  not a lot of pay comparatively and a strange company culture 
Raytheon,Systems Engineer,4,Raytheon keeps on losing their best young engineers to raises at other companies. Other than that the culture is alright. Large programs have too many dud engineers and firing them seems impossible so that’s a problem too.
Humana,Financial Reporting Consultant,4,"OK, but ever changing strategies. I can't think of any cons since my leaving had nothing to do with a negative experience. I learned a lot about healthcare during my time with the company."
Humana,Associate Director,3,Mixed bag depending on the division and department you work in. The company is hug and disconnected. Things are often inefficient due to constant changes in strategy at the company. 
Humana,Sales Support Representative,3,"Okay company to work at. Lots of work for not much pay, mandatory overtime is a pain at times. A lot of micromanagement supervisor require a lot. Over all okay company "
Humana,Associate Director,4,15 year employee.  This company has slid ever since Covid.  Pretty much entire company is remote at this point.  Everyone is hopeful that CEO change will be beneficial
Humana,Coordinator,4,Fun teams with managers who care about your input. Not the best paying health plan but not the worst. Opportunities to advance. Hybrid options and nice office. 
Humana,Production Leader,4,"Humana is a great company to work for, but I want to develop other skills. I like to work from home the busiest time of the year is the enrollment period, we work overtime and sometimes is overwhelmed."
Humana,Case Manager,5,One of my favorite jobs as a nurse. Good pay and excellent benefits. I lived working for this company. I could set my own schedule. It was great place to work 
Humana,Nurse Educator,3,Focused on whats best for the business. Many employees and roles for business  and clinicians. Recent leadership changes that should improve outlooks. 
Humana,Customer Service Representative,4,"adults are very immature for their age,more like catty high school vibes then people in thier 30's and 40's, the nicest most humble ppl are the people who clean up,everyone else is out to tell on each other for their own gain ."
Humana,RN Care Manager,4,I am lucky to be on a very supportive team with an AWESOME leader! I find the job challenging at times; but overall it’s a good place to work. You earn 7.07 hours of PTO each pay period and I’ve NEVER been denied to use it. I am pleased with the overall work environment at Humana.
Humana,Project Analyst,5,"I worked for Humana for almost 5 years but they aid me off, unfortunately.  With that being said upfront,  I do give Humana credit for being a great employer.  The work environment was good and not so toxic compared to other companies.  While I worked for Humana I was treated very well and fairly by my superiors.  "
Humana,Agent Support Representative,3,"A little stressful, hust started working here not too long ago. The PTO and benefits are great, but due to business needs its hard using it sometimes.  People here are great, i am lucky i have a breat leader but i have heard some horror stories. Make shre you have good wifi or you can be let go from what ive heard. Be ready to take lots of calls. Some of the trainers are not good teachers so be graceful with yourself."

Humana,Grievance and Appeals Specialist,4,I love working there in my last role.  I went back to school full time and that’s the only reason I am no longer there.  Getting your education was so easy to find with their tuition reimbursements.  You could be part time and day one they will offer this benefit.
Humana,Remote Sales Agent,3,Pay and benefits are better than most organizations but was not worth the stress. Pray you get a good manager that will support you and not beat you down.
Humana,Licensed Insurance Agent,5,"Sales is a high pressure job; and not everyone is cut out for it. Just like any sales job, you have to meet a quota. As long as you are determined to try your best, you won’t have any issues working here. "
Humana,MRA Coding Specialist (HCC CODER),5,I worked with Humana for 8 years and it was one of my best employers! I would recommend them! It was an incredible journey filled with a lot of great training and knowledge. They offered flexibility and a great work to home life balance.
Humana,Budget Analyst,1,They will bully you if you are a minority.  Try to find a job somewhere else with a serious professional environment.  No desire to teach you how the department operates.
Humana,Utilization Review Nurse,4,Everyone is very helpful.  There’s a lot of support and groups to join and great benefits .  Management is decent unless you have a micromanager then it’s a very difficult environment to work in.

A call center job provides a unique opportunity to develop strong communication skills by interacting with a diverse range of customers daily. It fosters a sense of accomplishment, as agents help resolve issues, answer questions, and ensure customer satisfaction. The fast-paced nature of the job keeps things interesting, while the team-oriented atmosphere builds camaraderie among colleagues. Additionally, call centers often offer flexible schedules, making it easier to balance work with personal life. There are also ample opportunities for career growth, with many companies promoting from within.

Humana,Financial Reporting Consultant,4,"OK, but ever changing strategies. I can't think of any cons since my leaving had nothing to do with a negative experience. I learned a lot about healthcare during my time with the company."
Humana,Remote,3,Great work life balance.  Relaxed remote schedule.  Company has been more focused on cost saving over the last couple of years than they have on valuing and acknowledging associates.  Motto seems to be do more with less these days.  Staffing levels decrease while expectations and goals increase.  
Humana,Learning Designer,4,"Humana offered early retirement for staff 55+.  Since that time, people over age 55 seem to have less value for promotions and pay raises.Many positions require being a clinician, despite having no clinical work.  Unfortunately, this eliminates qualified individuals from working with Humana to support the people on the insurance.  Clinicians are working jobs for which they have little training.  Overall, Humana seems in line with other insurance companies.  Managers do their best to provide flexibility to their associates when emergencies arise.  Many people are fearful of being laid off.  Many other people are curious how the new CEO will do."
Humana,Operator,1,"Spent almost 20 years in the machine in a variety of roles.  The people in charge, with the exception of some of the middle management, are disingenuous and self interested.   It’s about getting what they want at as low a cost as possible to their benefit.   The is shows in the company’s lack of true customer/member concern.  It’s about the money, nothing more and nothing less.  This applies to employees as well.  "
Humana,On-Site Account Manager,5,Humana was an incredible company to work for with flexible management and a great team of individuals on the commercial side. . I really miss my time there.  
Humana,Call Center Representative,4,"Calls back to back , there is no downtown. As soon as you get off one call another one comes in. The schedule was okay, work life balance was just not there"

Humana,Agent Support Representative,2,"A lot micromanagement not enough time to learn the material, Agents are rude at times. If you not use to micromanagements I would stay away if you don’t mind a lot of micromanagement then maybe a good fit for you. The micromanagement is over the top."
Humana,Telephonic Case Manager,2,What is the best part of working at the company?The money.  The training was a joke.  I never got to even touch or try the job I was hired for.  They were much more interested in whether or not I could master Teams and Skype.  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?They insisted that I master two communication systems.  I was truthful before I was hired  I told them right off the bat that I was not an expert on computer .  They never even let me try.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?My trainer was angry due to the fact she had just come off training a new employee.  That is what I had every day until I was let go.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I practiced Skype and Teams every day and every few days the supervisor would put me through a grueling session.  I was literally a nervous wreck by the time they let me go.
Humana,Senior Quality Assurance Analyst,4,"I love the flexible schedule, how easy it is to accumulate PTO, and working from home.   I also like the network resource groups and the work being done around diversity, equity and inclusion.  I hate the changing policies, procedures, guidance, and department I work in. There is always so much to do with little time in which to do it.  It’s hard to stay motivated within my department.  We also have too many customers.  "
Humana,Sales Associate,1,They do a lot of favoritism here so be aware. Other than that it’s a ok place and just like any other place it has its ups and downs. You’re pretty occupied.
Humana,Licensed Independent Medicare Insurance agent,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Humana is a great place. The company value their employees.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working for Humana is not stressfulWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment and culture is the best
Humana,Insurance Sales Agent,2,"Managers don't give a rat's as s about work culture or the team, most skip their individual meetings with you, they micromanage, are rude and do not appreciate any above and beyond. You're just a number, and you can and will be replaced at the drop of a hat if they want you out. If you make suggetions, they are shot down, you are then ciriticized and it's a cluster. Highly not recommended. "
Humana,RN Case Manager,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?None, lack of leadership, disorganization, unprofessionalismWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Asking more of your duties every day, no rewards or salary increase, toxic work environment,What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It was a toxic work environment What is a typical day like for you at the company?Full of work, feel threatened,"
Humana,Financial Reporting Consultant,4,"OK, but ever changing strategies. I can't think of any cons since my leaving had nothing to do with a negative experience. I learned a lot about healthcare during my time with the company."
Humana,Provider engagement executive,5,"Good leadership, opportunity for growth. Somewhat volatile industry.  Overall mission is aligned with providing great care for members but some IT systems make it difficult due to age and need upgrades desperately. "
Humana,Care Management Assistant,3,"Not what I expected when accepting the role. Had I known what the day-to-day tasks would consist of, I would not have accepted the position. Processes change quite consistently. Lack of transparency across the organization and limited room for growth. "
Humana,CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE,5,"The company  managements is a top notch. They really assist you well, teach you and wont embarass you. The office facilities is nice. Workmates are very nice. The culture is good operation manager of HCPR dep is extremely considerate and accommodating"
Humana,Care Coach,5,I really enjoyed my time at Humana. The staff is awesome and I had a great supervisor.  Work was manageable and everyone worked together well. Truly like a family.
Humana,Agent/Customer Service,1,Very unorganized systems never work a lot to learn and no one is on the same page. You will always feel lost. Floor support is no help they dont know anything either.
Humana,Field Marketing Representative,1,Management sets goals but if you’re new they have no time to train you. There even too lazy to show up to events when they are assigned to be at events with you for training purposes. 
Humana,Shipping and Receiving Clerk,2,"Management is detached from the ground floor workers. Most of your issues will be addressed to team leads who sometimes do not know what they are doing. Coworkers are bored with the monotonous warehouse work, so they often times create unnecessary drama to create a toxic work environment, and pull people into H.R. who had nothing to do with the incident. Pay and benefits was ok. That's about it. "
Humana,Care ManagerAssociate II,5,I was completely satisfied as an employee of Humana for the two years that I was employed with them. Excellent company to work for.There was rook for advancement
Humana,Claims Adjuster,5,"Awesome pay, flexible hours some departments allow you to work half days on FridaysRemotePto every 2 weeks. Room for advancement after 12-18 months depending on role. "
Humana, Supervisor ,4,"Must meet set goals for your department.  Humana has a lot of benefits and is a great place to work, but be prepared your job could be cut at anytime.   Departments are constantly making changes. "
Humana,Inbound Contact Representative 3,3,"I am a high performing employee and unfortunately my department overworks me, assigns many responsibilities/roles for little increase in pay. No significant title change. I feel I am being exploited.  Typical day for me can vary, I am either taking inbound calls and acting as “supervisor” in the evenings or training new hires during the day and supervising agents in the evenings.  They do NOT tailor your pay to costs of living of where you reside.. So I am essentially doing more than the average agent and pay is not meeting my needs. Lack of communication and transparency from leadership. Lack of company culture. Training and resources still need lots of improvement, but it seems they are finally working on that. PTO is one of the best things I have experienced in this role. "
Humana,Grievance and Appeals Specialist,1,"This Dept micromanages heavily and does not supply the help that you need. You voice, your concerns and nothing is ever done about it except you can do more work. All they care about is pushing numbers and goals and metrics are not realistic when over half of the department struggles. It’s like a set up for failure. You are constantly threatened with write ups and Coachings that leads to job termination. "
Humana,Medical Billing Supervisor,5,What is the best part of working at the company?It has Wonderful Benefits and many chances for advancement What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with upset customers but you just explained what they need and usually it is resolved.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It is a great culture. Many work at home positions.  They still make you feel part of a great team!What is a typical day like for you at the company?Billing was working reconciling accounts and talking to group BA’s about members of thier group!  Very busy .
Humana,Technical Lead,4,"Knowledgeable team, defined roles, IT/Business aligned with agile practices.  Generally good coworkers. Use of enterprise solutions and advanced agile practice presented opportunities to learn and grow. "
Humana,Remote ,3,"Team leaders are nice and coworkers were friendly but the management members were always bombarding you with emails every month focused on things that left you no doubt which side of the political isle they were on. People want to know things that affect their work, not political views.Also, there were 2 huge sudden unexpected layoffs in the 3 years I was there."
Humana,Licensed Insurance Agent,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Pay is higher than others, the benefits are great, and it is work from home. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Computer system issues happen frequently What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very diverse and supportive management"
Humana,Supervisor,5,Company really invests assets into developing associates careers. The company also will promote from within and has very flexible PTO including volunteer time off.  
Humana,Appeals and Grievance Specialist,1,"Every day there are different instructions, teams don't agree, supervisors don't answer questions, and leave employees with more doubts. The very low pay for all the work that is done, archaic systems, supervisor who is never available and does not provide the necessary tools to do the job well. The only good thing is that the work was at home. They have ridiculous and absurd metrics. Look another place to apply job, not here."
Humana,Remote,5,This is a great company work for as most there’s always MacroMania flexible. A great environment they provide the equipment. I wish they reimbursed your Wi-FiO
Humana,Inbound Customer Service Representative,5,Humana is a great company to work for you. Benefits are good. Schedules are good. I learned a lot from this company . I would recommend anyone to work for Humana 
Humana,Financial Reporting Consultant,4,"OK, but ever changing strategies. I can't think of any cons since my leaving had nothing to do with a negative experience. I learned a lot about healthcare during my time with the company."
Humana,Referral Coordinator 2 for Military Personnel,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Love it & love working at homeWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Some of the referrals that is all over the fax note & doesn't specify exactly of what the pt needs, & need more raiseWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Just love working with humana"
Humana,Inbound Customer Service Representative,2,"It was okay. I didn't like that once you learned something, a couple of months later you were training on something different. Too much work for $18 an hour to be a Fortune 500 company."
Humana,Inbound Contact Representative,4,This company prioritizes work life balance and creating a stress free environment. The managers are very micromanaging. They put the customers first. 
Humana,inbound rep,3,I enjoy working here but it is a lot and very much on your back for different inconspicuous metrics. sometimes people are nice. other times it is not the case and takes a toll on you p
Humana,Clinical Operations Coordinator,3,"When I started I had friends that worked here and loved it. Let me say,  THIS WILL NOT BE EVERYONE'S EXPERIENCE. I worked in clinical operations.  It was fine at first but they slowly add more and more work without pay bumbs. They expect you to basically be a team lead in the chat without being paid for it, even if your not sure of the answer yourself. This was pressured on me in almost all of my 1on1 with supervisor, although I expressed I was uncomfortable with that she said it shows us your a leader?  There's so much miscommunication with the leaders it ridiculous. I tried for so long to get hired on with humana but it is not the culture for me. It is everyone for themselves and no one really cares about you or your best interest. "
Humana,RN Case Manager,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?My last team was the best! They cared for me during my 3 surgeries.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Frequent changes, multiple system issues What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Focus on self care, member careWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Each day is different & has its own challenges"
Humana,UM Coordinator,1,"I’m working for this company for 6 months, the manager never knew when the contract would end, very stressful not knowing when would be the last day. The work was also contracted out to another country who would then take over jobs in America. The other contractor employees would often go to the managers to point out others errors, very catty even in remote world. Would not recommend working with the group out of Kentucky. "
Humana,utilization management clinical pharmacist,1,"This company exemplifies toxic workplaces that exploit an oversupply of pharmacists, ultimately harming our profession. They pay flex pharmacists less than $50 an hour and monitor every minute of their activities, showing no trust or respect for them. Only 5-10% of employees survive the VSP pool, and even full-time hires are fired if they fail to meet metrics a few times.During my time as a full-time employee, I never received health insurance through Humana because I constantly feared losing my job. Policies change every month, and the new OneNote updates are easily missed if you're unaware of them. Their poor utilization of technology is frustrating, and management is too incompetent to make improvements that could save tens of thousands of dollars. Avoid applying for this job, as companies like this are what’s killing our profession and devaluing pharmacists."
Humana,Medical Coding Auditor,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The people and environment are amazing!

Humana,Claims Processing Representative 2,4,"Emails in the early Am, one on ones or team meeting before noon, production work steady and consistent throughout day, emails in the afternoon before leaving. Hardest part of the job is being your own boss to a level that is required if you want advancement. Enjoyable part is the great benefits and Pto package. "
Humana,Customer Service Representative,1,Like working for this company did not feel like i was tethered to my computer all day worked from home not micromanage.Good training and decent pay...
Humana,Bilingual Customer Service Representative,2,"The training  was too fast with the complicated system they use, My trainer and higher ups were nice though.  The interview process is long but the pay is decent to start."
Humana,TRICARE Director of Behavioral Health,5,"Proud to have worked at Humana. Wish I could have had more time there,  it lay offs impacted my position as well as my team. Great work life balance, fair compensation, nice culture. "
Humana,Agent,3,"Good opportunity,  decent training but lots of turnover as is the norm in any sales job but here the turnover is widespread throughout the company over the past 2 years. Keep one eye on your back at all times"
Humana,Senior Oncology Sales Specialist,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The culture is the best part of of working at Humana.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Getting patients from RX to being delivered at their home.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Welcoming and helpful is the type of environment at Humana.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Typical day is working to my pharm tech and see what is missing to get patients scheduled on therapy.
Humana,Appeals Representative,4,Good benefits.  Not much room for advancement.  I like the fact that this job is fully remote and you can work early if you'd like.  Other than that it can use some improvement
Humana,Medicaid Specialist,3,great and caring managers. Everyone helped you when needed and gave you the time of day to explain things if they were not done correctly.  there was more training then actual working but we got extensive training on everything before actually starting the work.
Humana,Claims Supervisor,4,It truly is about who you know to move up in this company. I have been with them for 9 years and it took almost all 9 just to get into a supervisor role even with exceptional ratings. The pay is not the best either. They do not compensate you for your experience or adjust your pay when they adjust the pay scale. there are people in the same role that have been with the company less than 4 years and making more than me even though I do more work and have been with the company 9 years. The department I am in does not care to much about the leaders and forces them to come in office when no one else works in office in the organization. We have been understaffed for years and budgeted for more people but instead of hiring onshore people they continue to divert the issue to overseas. 
Humana,Technology Lead,5,"It is in an onshore and offshore setting. great benefit. 401 K, PTO, Education Assistance,growth,stability, exposure to new technologies, fast paced wor"
Freddie Mac,"Systems Analysis, Associate",4,"Culture is behind a few years, most employees are older with families and not so adaptive to change. Very diverse workforce and inclusive environment with solid job security and compensation. Freddie Mac has been under conservatorship since 2008, so there are many rules and controls, almost making it a government agency. Although it is a GSE, there is a possibility of going public again around 2030."
Freddie Mac,Financial Planning & Analysis Professional,1,"Abusive and intrusive manager, no support from HR, not interested in helping develop their employees at all. Sluggish management. Disorganized team. Would only recommend if you're just looking to get in, get paid, and get out"
Freddie Mac,Software Developer,1,"A good place to work on paper but when you arrive get ready for the toxic work environment of meeting deadlines , poor management and communication, and being micromanaged. Mid level management is t involved in everyday activities of the team which leads them to go off of perception rather than their experience involved in doing the project. Highly political and one race rules the tech divisions where they protect and lookOut for their own and not Americans."
Freddie Mac,Manager,5,Great company with a ton of benefits. Nice culture and employees. Hybrid 3 days in office is horrible. That should be flexible. Employees morale declined when that happened 
Freddie Mac,Agile Software Development Associate II,4,Work-life balance is good. Plenty of opportunities and mentorship available to develop your skills and grow as software developer. Some projects have terrible management.
Freddie Mac,Quantitative Analyst,2,"The work is super micromanaged with deadlines commonly set on the same day or next day.Management is quite bad and does not care about employees at all, only themselves."
Freddie Mac,Sr. Engineer,5,"- Great place to work - I was with the company for more than 18 years. Transparency and good leadership. Family oriented, accommodative for the individual needs."
Freddie Mac,DevOps/Build and Release Engineer,4,Nice place to work with good cafeteria. People are friendly and good opportunities to learn new skills in your area of expertise. In the end it all depends on the team & the boss you are working 
Freddie Mac,Other,3,"Productivity is #1, no work/life balance, excellent pay/benefits, management style hands off - not connected with employees, many layers of management "
Freddie Mac,Manager,4,"Wonderful company with great benefits. They truly care about their employees and respect that everyone has a life outside of work. However, pay is low compared to the market and annual bonus is laughable. "
Freddie Mac,Analyst,3,"Freddie Mac is a great place to work if you value a supportive and inclusive work environment. The company offers competitive compensation and excellent benefits, which are significant perks. However, there are areas that need improvement, particularly in communication and career development. With some adjustments, Freddie Mac could be an even better place to build a career."
Freddie Mac,Analyst,4,"overall it is a good place to work, great co-workers, supportive management, and overall it is a great place to work and stay for long term, based on my experience"
Freddie Mac,Catering Server,5,What I learned every dayManagers are often indifferent.Co-workers are excellent.The work is hard but knowing it is done with more pleasure.I will always be grateful to the managers who supported us in the 2020 pandemic

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Changing work schedule and being remote.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Office environment was good.   Staff wanted to get things right for the clients.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Agile ceremonies and evaluating Risk and Release Mgmt.
Freddie Mac,Sr. Product Manager,2,It is just ok. Very less resources and more workload. Can get overwhelming. Promotions are not easy. Depends on your team and management. Work 3 days a week
Freddie Mac,Marketing Specialist,4,The company offers an excellent benefits package but the pay was sub-par. There are tons of office politics to navigate as well. If you're just starting out in your career this is a great place to get a wide variety of opportunities before moving on to somewhere else. 
Freddie Mac,Software Engineer,1,Typical day consists of daily meeting and working on assigned tasks. Learned how to work with a lot of new tools. Management is very incompetent and makes changes to technical team members by firing those they don’t like. The hardest part of the job is always having an anxiety of potentially loosing a job because of politics(rumor) and inefficient managers.
Freddie Mac,Compliance Examiner,5,"I have been with Freddie Mac 13 years and have held 3 different roles: great leadership, benefits and growth opportunities. I expect to end my career at Freddie Mac "
Freddie Mac,Operations Analyst,5,"Growth and opportunity found in a big and small world. Genuinely good culture overall in all the divisions. Haven't worked with bad management, everyone is open to sharing and teaching"
Freddie Mac,Senior Agile Coach,1,The company culture was very micro managing and lots of pressure and scrutiny from leadership which passed down to the teams and this put unnecessary pressure on me. Some very incompetent people  within program/ product teams. Very toxic environment with no room to experiment and fail. Super princess oriented with heavy oversight by all levels of management. 
Freddie Mac,Application Management Sr.,5,What is the best part of working at the company?work flexibility to balance work lifeWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Contractors will not be given local parking lot rather park in separate parking lot 10 minutes of walk.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Mixed culture of mixed people working.What is a typical day like for you at the company?busy with routines process making busy all the day

Freddie Mac,Senior Analyst,3,Treat consultants like second class citizens but if you get a full time offer I think could be worth it. Lots of politics and internal group favoritism.
Freddie Mac,Finance Analyst,5,"I started working here as a new graduate and it has been a great experience. The company culture is kind and welcoming, and there is always an effort to make its employees happy. You have a lot of opportunity to grow and move around the company to try different lines of work. Definitely recommend working here. "
Freddie Mac,EVP,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Good company but legal department seems they run the place which is awful for procurement personnel when comtracts  are being  negotiated for internal customer that needs an understanding of what legal put into contract details which made no sense What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working with legal experts their lawyers who seem to run the entire company What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressed always in daily work load because of their legal department whom seem to run the entire company What is a typical day like for you at the company?Very stressful endeavors always making the purchasing process difficult and frustrating.  As their legal lawyers seem to want to run everything
Freddie Mac,Sr. Agile Coach – Modern Delivery Office,2,What is the best part of working at the company?People are the only reason it wasn't lower. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Regulations and bloated process in the face of implementing leanWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?High stress low appreciation. They think their data is the most important asset and it shows
Freddie Mac,Software Developer,2,"The toxic environment and the management are very bad.  No pay for overtime. Also, you will have a lot of stress because of a bad manager's decision. Don't work here"
Freddie Mac,Graphic Designer,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Pay and benefits.  That’s it from my experience. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Rather than speak my truth, I will give quotes from others that were there with me… “it’s a highly toxic culture,” “extremely  political,” “passive aggressive”, “extreme cronyism.”What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Incredibly toxic, incompetent and retaliatory management, all about looking busy and aligning yourself properly to avoid the regular layoffs. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Not being challenged, striving to look busy, and struggling to keep my mouth shut with all the horrific decision making going on."
Freddie Mac,Manager,3,Senior Management does not stay at the company.  CEO’s only last a couple of years. Pay is not up to standard. Raises are almost nonexistent.  Benefits are costly. 
Freddie Mac,Director,4,"You get to work with some of the best people in the industry. People are generally helpful and collaborative. Being a systematically important organization, stable business, can plan a long term career. "
Freddie Mac,Internal Communications Intern,3,"The internships lacked structure but provided a good learning experience.  More support from my manager would have been appreciated. With that said, the work life balance was a major perk. "
Freddie Mac,Software Engineer,1,terrible place for citizens to work at. unpaid overtime is the culture and expected. most people are here for visa funding. people get abused for cheap labor
Freddie Mac,Customer Service Representative,5,Great environment to work! Great experience overall! Plenty of opportunities for advancement! Great leadership and plenty of assistance from your peers. 
Freddie Mac,Senior Data Analyst,3,"For years it felt as if Freddie's treatment of its employees was first and foremost about their well-being and work-life balance. The actions of leadership starting in 2021 or so have undermined that relationship, all while claiming nothing has changed. For years almost all employees had two days remote work, per week, which made the transition to all remote work during COVID easier, and in fact a lot of messaging indicated that this was the new normal. This was turned on its face in 2022 and almost all employees were forced at the beginning of this year to return to three days in the office. It has also been communicated that employees should feel lucky we have not eliminated remote work. This is typical of leadership treatment of employees since that time. Priorities and organization also appear to be constantly in flux. A lot of employees have left in the last few years and there are not many signs of that reversing."
Freddie Mac,Sr. Associate,4,"Benefits are ok, 401k match starts after 1 year, 15 days of vacation with 8 days of sick leave and 2 discretionary holiday days. Phone bill is not covered. Managers seem very flexible to work life balance"
Freddie Mac,Business Analyst,4,Excellent company treated employees very well and has fantastic atmosphere as well as great people and leaders and products there should not be anyone who does not want to work here
Freddie Mac,Senior Risk Analyst,5,I've been at Freddie for over 2 years and I can confidently say this is the best company I've ever worked for. The salary is very good and the work is equally challenging as it is fun.
Freddie Mac,Technical Project Manager/Senior Scrum Coach,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?People have a ""can-do"" attitude.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Too many unnecessary undocumented processes. Extremely risk averse. People are just thrown at the projects.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?There is no culture of a team. Managers do company-mandated socialization. Managers are too busy to spend time with employees."
Freddie Mac,Associate,2,"The systems in place at the company are so outdated. Management was trying to invest in better programs but to no avail. Speaking of management, I had a couple toxic managers during my time. One was a micromanger, who didn't know what she was talking about half of the time. Another was basically a snake, he would tell you one thing and do something else behind closed doors. There are good people at the company but they are far and few between. Unfortunately, most of the turnover happened when the good ones found a better job. The compensation/benefits are fair, and the work/life balance was above average. Advancement is a bit sketchy as well. A lot of individuals make lateral moves because most managers aren't willing to promote within. As a result, I had too many colleagues leave once they found a better gig. "
Freddie Mac,Intern,4,My team was accessible and supportive while I worked as an intern this summer. Will return if I get an offer. Hours were flexible and I felt excited to log on everyday
Freddie Mac,Analyst,3,"It’s a huge place so it all depends on where and who you work for… pretty good in all aspects if you just do your job. But, there is a lot of rearranging ppl to suit the ppl they want in their teams. Lots of reorganization. When I was there the technology was ancient in some areas."
Freddie Mac,"Systems Analysis, Associate",4,"Culture is behind a few years, most employees are older with families and not so adaptive to change. Very diverse workforce and inclusive environment with solid job security and compensation. Freddie Mac has been under conservatorship since 2008, so there are many rules and controls, almost making it a government agency. Although it is a GSE, there is a possibility of going public again around 2030."
Freddie Mac,Security Engineer,1,"At least once a week there is some comment to teams about needing to find new job.  Often get comments about not taking the job seriously because you take time off.  Hired on as fully remote but continue to hear threats about making everyone r come to the office im on the west coast so that would make me unemployed. Pay, benefis, and time off is good.  "
Freddie Mac,Analyst,4,"Honestly really good rotational program. however, folks on the investment side can be extremely rude. The folks that were on the data analytics and finance side were always sweet."
Freddie Mac,Scrum Master,3,Fragmented and disjointed IT org. Management heavy with lack of cohesiveness of implementation or deployment of platforms. Lots of good people but incentives are lopsided.
Freddie Mac,Affordable Multifamily Underwriter (Contract),5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The Freddie Mac group in Plano, Texas is well managed.  The people are very helpful in sharing information to make the dream team work. Grade ""A"" facility with excellent IT support and facility support on site. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?A challenge for me was learning the different IT Platforms utilized for processing loans. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work culture is a cohesiveness one in which all employees are treated with respect. What is a typical day like for you at the company?A typical day begins with a stop at the in-house coffee bar and check the news in the employee lounge.  Check calendar for upcoming meetings and prepare for presentations.  Read emails for previous days work to determine if follow up is needed.  Next work the loan pipeline for upcoming closings."
Freddie Mac,Program Manager,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?The best job! Inclusive with regard to assessing efficiency & effectiveness of processes & programs. Good compensation, great benefits and service awards and recognition program.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Middle management gridlock. A large pool of ambitious high performers that surpassed the opportunities available for timely promotions.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Fast paced, innovative and evolving environment with steadfast commitment to employee empowerment, diversity, and internal & external service and sustainability."
Freddie Mac,Senior Systems Administrator,2,They pay well and the benefits are ok.  Work life balance is something they talk about but for the IT department but it is nonexistent.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with management.  It’s hard to enjoy working somewhere where you don’t feel a level of trust with your employer.  Long after I left they hired a much larger group of new people and replaced the entire team.  Before this occurred they gave every team member a very poor review two years in a row that did not reflect their actual work value and ethic to justify the cost of replacing them all.
Freddie Mac,Multifamily Intern,5,"I've really enjoyed interning here so far but program is ongoing so I don't have much to say. For people looking to intern here, you'll meet a lot of people who really want to help you grow and learn about the industry. If I were to think of something negative, it would be that, as of the Summer of 2023, it seems like the hybrid/remote work environment is a bit unorganized and there are a lot  of people on my team who aren't in the office which is a shame because as an intern you want to meet new people and get some face time with them."
Freddie Mac,Product Manager,3,"Although the job is government stable, it has all the politics and red tape of the government. Innovation is squashed for risk management at every turn"
Freddie Mac,Project Manager,3,"Legitimately a wonderful work environment full of experienced, well-meaning people who will go out of their way to make sure you are able to both learn from and contribute to you assigned team. However, you better sharpen those networking skills as there is no other way for advancement beyond simply waiting your turn. While this may sound de facto for any corporate environment it should be noted that the quality and amount of work you produce is valued at a much lower level than the relationships you forge with leadership. If you're a concentrated social climber you'll most likely excel, but for those of us that simply want to grow and contribute through our craft it is a confusing and sometimes demoralizing path to promotion. "
Freddie Mac,Six Sigma Black Belt,4,Felt like I could make a difference.  The company itself made a big difference in peoples lives and it was refreshing to be a part of something bigger than yourself.
Freddie Mac,Loan Servicing ,4,The company has nice benefits which includes first home mortgage assistance and student loan payment assistance. Areas of improvement include a need of better technology and a more straightforward internal hiring/ promotion process.
Freddie Mac,Quantitative Analytics Manager,2,"A good place to start learning about the finance of loan securitization.  Work/life balance is relatively good. Benefits are also good, including paternity leave."
Freddie Mac,Credit Manager,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Volunteerism. There is a strong push to be involved and volunteer.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Low raises. Long hours. Because there are no attainable goals the workload is never ending. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Disconnected from the office. What is a typical day like for you at the company?About 11 hours online. Some Teams calls but mainly computer work.
Freddie Mac,Operational Resilience Sr. Manager,1,Very top down and authoritative. Kiss-the-ring culture.  Favoritism and who you know are the only avenues to promotion.  Very little opportunity for advancement or recognition. 
Freddie Mac,Senior Financial Analyst,3,"Was a great company until new management took over in 2021. Ever since, mandating 3 days a week in office (monitoring badging in rates smh), moral is bad. "
Freddie Mac,Information Security Professional,4,I enjoyed my time with Freddie Mac.  Coworkers were positive and there were many ways you can either grow in your position or move up.  Executive leadership direction can be confusing at times
Freddie Mac,Senior Executive Coordinator,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The people I work with are like family. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The bureaucracy, the lack of holding certain people accountable, poor leadership,  just being clueless. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The culture use to be good but now it has gone straight to h$llWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?The thought of going to work stresses me out"
Freddie Mac,Internal Communications Specialist,3,"You have to get lucky with a good team. Upper management is “old school” and are more interested in you your reputation than the quality of your work. Because of this managers at all levels are not promoted because of their ability to lead, or knowledge, but because of their ability to network and schmooze. Employees at every level are overloaded with meetings so it’s difficult to get your work completed from 9-5, and while they say they are a flexible workplace they are not. "
Freddie Mac,Operational Risk Senior ,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The insurance coverage and the pay is greatWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management, I’ve worked with some of the worst managers within Freddie Mac. HR is useless What is the work environment and culture like at the company?I’ve worked in two areas and they were very toxic. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Meetings meetings and more meetings"
Freddie Mac,"Director, Conferences & Events, Multifamily Division",5,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to work with. All are dedicated & hardworking in their own contributions to further the mission of Freddie Mac.
Freddie Mac,"Systems Analysis, Associate",4,"Culture is behind a few years, most employees are older with families and not so adaptive to change. Very diverse workforce and inclusive environment with solid job security and compensation. Freddie Mac has been under conservatorship since 2008, so there are many rules and controls, almost making it a government agency. Although it is a GSE, there is a possibility of going public again around 2030."
Freddie Mac,Loan Product Advisor Support Specialist- Senior,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Pay and benefits aren't bad overall.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management really doesn't care about the employees despite saying they do.  Multiple surveys with no changes.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?False. Management pretends to care but does.not.
Freddie Mac,Fraud Investigator,4,"The work was interesting but the culture was very, very bland. Probably as a result of conservatorship but also some very nice but boring staff. Pay was very competitive but the loss of stock options really cut down on the razzle dazzle and they didn't make up for it with direct pay."
Freddie Mac,"Director, IT Audit",3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great benefits.  401k and paid sick leave were very generous.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Seemed to be a very adversarial work environment.  Lots of internal srife, leading to turnover.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Adversarial amoungst departments.  No one really wanted to work with other groups.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Lots and lots of meetings.  Expect to be on meetings 8-10 hours some days."
Freddie Mac,Manager,3,"Favorites are promoted.  Good work is undervalued.  Promotions are done in not so mysterious ways.  VP, Director and Sr. Management arrive in groups and lock down the highest paying positions and pretend to be honest people.  HR is complicit in all unfairness and will state 'change takes time' until the end of time."
Freddie Mac,Senior Software Engineer,2,I have over 20 years experience. Started back to Freddie a few years ago. I was enjoying my time there and thinking that I could retire there. Then 2023 happened. The open concept and lack of remote flexibility crushed my dream. There is no business need that I can see for going to the office to take Teams calls among a pit of others doing the same.
Freddie Mac,Analyst,3,Good work life balance and job satisfaction is entirely dependent on what team you’re on. Freddie Mac being in a conservatorship has its unique challenges.
Freddie Mac,Sr. Sybase DBA,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The technical employees were welcoming and eager to provide resources.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?They work with various technologies, and you are expected to have indepth knowledge of all their technologies.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Friendly, dynamic, and fast paced.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Typical, not too challenging if your experience is solid."
Freddie Mac,Technology Analyst,1,"New CEO is on a crusade to force everyone back in office, with upping the amount of days in office from 2 to 3 and punishing anyone who doesn't consistently come into the office all 3 days, as well as massively reducing the amount of remote jobs and making the transition to remote from hybrid basically impossible. CEO probably dreams of one day forcing 5 days in office. Company is bleeding talent, I've heard of a team that went from 6 devs to 2 in a month due to the announcement. Do not come here if you value remote work and flexibility. Company needs to get rid of the CEO asap and restore remote work & flexibility (reminder that 2020 and 2021 were record profit years for the company, while being fully remote)"
Freddie Mac,DB2 UDB DBA,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?The work culture is bad , its not friendly for female employees and also its more like an indian company.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Overtime work What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Not good , Not friendly What is a typical day like for you at the company?extra hours of work everyday"
Freddie Mac,Assistant General Counsel,1,"The upper management is requiring employees to be in the office every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday with absolutely no flexibility. They are insanely focused on people being back in the office. It is less flexible now than before the pandemic in terms of remote work. "
Freddie Mac,Business Management Operations Intern,5,"Internship was great, they made me feel like a real part of the team.I worked for the executives. and they although there was not much work for me, they still made me feel  a part of the team with the work i was given"
Freddie Mac,Analyst,4,"Good place to work here it suggest we’ll being of employees, only thing is less remote work and more stressful work here and going to office within the "
Freddie Mac,Software Engineer,2,They are taking away some of the most important benefits from employees here for god knows what reason. They took away covid leave because it clearly isn’t a thing anymore and they are forcing people back into office when it is been abundantly shown how unhappy most employees are. WFH benefits from pre-pandemic have been severely reduced and employees are being forced into office 3 days a week without choice on which days. Some of the most brilliant professionals I’ve met have jumped ship in preparation for this inevitable shipwreck we are headed in. Work/life balance is not the best either so be prepared to work long hours into the night and expected to be in office the next day. Career growth is very slow with minimal promotions and low pay raises.You will meet some really great people while working here. There is great talent at the company but really low morale due to harsh management and no work/life balance.
Freddie Mac,IT Analyst,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits are great, salary generally competitive, co-workers cover the complete spectrum. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?job insecurity.  few staff last 5 years and staff let go without warning or reason.   What is the work environment and culture like at the company?mostly professional, but can vary by office / co-workers.  What is a typical day like for you at the company?same as any other"
Freddie Mac,Scrum Master/Project Manager,3,"Decent company to work for, great benefits and most people, however the static three days in office policy will most defintely backfire and lose the best people"
Freddie Mac,"Executive Coordinator Sr. II, Compliance",5,"Starting salaries are good and increases in salary and yearly bonuses are consistently fair. The issue, in my opinion, with FM is Upper Management. Most have been there too long and hold on to “old ways” of doing everything. It needs a refresh and also, more diversity."
Freddie Mac,Reporting Professional,3,"The people you work with day to day at Freddie Mac are TOP NOTCH. Senior management, however, has turned a deaf ear to what employees are saying about return to work, which is driving some of those wonderful employees away. We have the highest attrition rate we've had in years. It is disheartening. "
Freddie Mac,Product Development,1,Loved the colleagues I worked with but very little opportunity to advance due to artificial barriers by management. The people who were promoted tended to be unqualified and favorites of management.
Freddie Mac,Loan Accounting Senior,1,Too much work for such little pay.  You are expected to work crazy hours with no attention to you and work life balance is just about non existent unless you force the issue. 
Freddie Mac,Financial controller,3,Upward mobility can be tough as internal promotions are rare and you need to apply to other areas to get promoted. Raises for promotions are not high. Work life balance here is great depending on which division you work for. Some divisions work 40-60 hours while others work less. 
Freddie Mac,"Systems Analysis, Associate",4,"Culture is behind a few years, most employees are older with families and not so adaptive to change. Very diverse workforce and inclusive environment with solid job security and compensation. Freddie Mac has been under conservatorship since 2008, so there are many rules and controls, almost making it a government agency. Although it is a GSE, there is a possibility of going public again around 2030."
Freddie Mac,Jr. Software Developer,4,Overall work is pleasant and your colleagues are always fun to be around. The company is involved  in very impactful work and said impacts are clear and wide reaching.
Freddie Mac,Scrum Master/Project Manager,3,Back to office policy is 3 days going in the wrong direction was planned for 2 I’m not sure why they want to give workers less flexibility this will most likely backfire 
Freddie Mac,Project Manager,4,"The benefits are good, there is plenty of challenging work to do, however the move to 3 days in the office is not appealing to most. Several people have already left."
Freddie Mac,"Project Management Senior, SF Offerings",2,"Decent pay, can and be very stressful. Difficult to apply to other positions as its supposed to be discrete however I have heard that the hiring manager contact current manager."
Freddie Mac,Project Manager,3,"Pretty easy going place to work. Lots of great people. Great benefits, horrible pay. The attrition has always been a big problem, but they refuse to pay to market. There used to be great work/life balance and flexibility, but the new CEO is a dinosaur and is taking a lot of that away. For now, don’t work here unless he rolls back on this. The attrition that is going to take place over the next few months (due to the new rules from CEO) will cause the company to bleed, and it won’t be a good place to be."
Freddie Mac,Senior Staff,1,"Blindly focused on one way of doing things.  No documentation,  but you are openly criticized of you can't figure out their non standard practices without access or guidance. Poor decisions on which tech to use.  Does not consider advice on alternate solutions to unsolved problems.  Very much like a classroom where deliverables do not matter.   Solutions are not thought of or engineered,  just grab what is ""neat"" and play. "
Freddie Mac,Technology Account Manager/ Strategic Delivery and Technology Integration,5,Management communicates with employees often great benefits and a great place to balance work life. Lots of flexibility and knowledgeable employees to help you when needed
Freddie Mac,Associate General Counsel,5,"Interesting work, good culture, nice people, good work/life balance, great in diversity.   Pay and benefits had been good but lagging behind the market since 2020 even while the company is making billions.  Limited advancement opportunities once you reach a certain level"
Freddie Mac,Data Analytics Senior,3,"If you want to cost, this is the place to be. Most people are at the point in their careers where they're happy at their current position. Not for people who want to build a skillset and improve. Managment is tone-deaf and the new CEO is a trainwreck that no one likes.Having said that, the people are awesome and the WLB is incredible."
Freddie Mac,"McLean, VA",5,"Nice place to work with great people, diversity, respect and potential for future growth. Offers plenty of opportunity to learn, grow and contribute to everyone's success"
Freddie Mac,Financial Management Manager,5,Freddie Mac is a wonderful company to work for who has the important mission of fulfilling the American dream of owning your own home! Their work/life balance is outstanding. 
Freddie Mac,Director,3,#NAME?
Freddie Mac,Director ,5,Great people and good corporate culture.  Great work/life balance. Quality of management is mixed. There are some really good managers and some are ok managers. 
Freddie Mac,Software Developer,3,#NAME?
Freddie Mac,Software Engineer,5,"Good place to work.Great work/life balaceOne of the best benefits.Depending on a team you are working, some technologies and practices might be outdated "
Freddie Mac,Senior Director,4,"Been at Freddie Mac for nearly 15 years and used to love it. As of late, senior leadership is taking the company in the wrong direction and disrupting company culture. Many employees are burned out, stressed out, and overworked."
Freddie Mac,Senior Executive Coordinator,1,"New leadership and they are changing the Freddie Mac culture. It’s use to be a great place to work but they are turning it into something else. It’s horrible! They don’t pay well, the benefit are ok but you have to pay out of pocket a lot. A lot of unfair things happening like they promote employees without posting the position to give other a shot at it and this list goes on. "
Freddie Mac,Software Engineer,4,"You could be either with a great department or a bad one. If you're lucky, you get to work with great people and grow your career. If you're unlucky, you're in a world of suck."
Freddie Mac,Intern,5,"Very collaborative and positive environment to work at. Excellent benefits and work-life balance, company embraces holding onto talent for as long as possible and investing in their development."
Freddie Mac,Financial Controller Senior,5,"Great place to work.Company is very doversed and people are friendly and respectful.Most divisions have a good work life balance. However, it's slow moving, highly bureaucratic since it's a very large GSE. "
GE,Senior Operations Manager,5,"If you want to work with great people and great technology, you should consider GE despite it's recent setbacks.  Over my lengthy career at GE Aviation, one thing was consistent - highly talented employees came to work every day and tried to solve complex problems and succeeded more times than they failed."
GE,Manager,2,"my work varies so my days go fast. GE has a lot of different faciliteis and take safety very seriously but some policies don't fit individual sites but we have to go through it anyway- lots of policies, standards, etc. and seems top heavy.As for benefits, the deductibles are over the top high- nearly $600 per month in premium payment for a $6000 deductible. Not much good unless you have a major emergency. It's just money out of my paycheck and feels like paying a lot of money for nothing. There is no company contribution for HSA, prescription plan only pays after you reach deductible, so if you have a $500/month medication just add that on top of your monthly premium until you reach your deductible. It really a joke for such a highly profitable company. I've worked for smaller companies and had extremely better benefits."
GE,Assembler 2,4,"The company payed well. The benefits were amazing! Paid time off, paid sick leave and paid holidays. Medical and dental insurance. Matching 401k. The down side was a lot of mandatory overtime. "
GE,Marketing Communications Specialist,5,GE is a very professional environment and offers opportunities to develop a diverse range of skills.  Management is very knowledgeable and interested in developing the employees.
GE,Lean specialist,4,"What is the best thing to work in the company? Benefits and support of the leaders What is the most stressful of working in the company? Arbitrary performance evaluation, there are no measurable goals How is the environment and the culture of work in theCompany? Relaxed culture, always with a focus on continuous improvement."
GE,Senior Operations Manager,5,No cons! Great place to work in! Interesting benefits and great people!  I hope to be able to stay within this company till my happy retirement! Way to go GE!
GE,Account Manager,4,Constant changes make for an interesting workplace. Competitive pay and benefits. Good work environment. They create a nutturing and inclusive community 
GE,Designer,4,"Working at GE was an incredible experience. I had the privilege of being part of the marketing team as a designer, collaborating with talented professionals and visionary leaders who encouraged creativity and growth. The supportive environment allowed me to refine my skills and contribute meaningfully to impactful campaigns. "
GE,Technicien de maintenance,5,"Very good business, really well paid, I had a very good time in this business and the work is very interesting and enriching.Good atmosphere"
GE,Welder/Fabricator/Laborer,5,"I worked there in 2021 covid was still a big deal, management was good mostly, pay was acceptable, they were understanding during times I had to take off for being sick or family emergencies. My only complaint would be some of the employees treat other employees poorly based on gender. (I'm a girl) "
GE,Senior Software Engineer,4,"Good and nothing to say cons.Good culture.Have a good work-life balance.Technology, learning and good team members and very supportive.Nothing to say about the hardest part of the job in the GE"
GE,"Senior Materials Planning & Execution Manager,",5,"Work was highly valued as an individual and within a team.  Greatly appreciated.The company has practiced and expects ethical behavior at all times. Do the right thing.Working almost 40 years here, I saw many changes. Mostly to the better. Most definitely towards work life balance. Definitely stressful, but doing your best with positive attitude and energy it is a great place  to work."
GE,Production Operator,3,"GE isn’t the worst place to work. The pay is awful and there is a LOT of overtime but the coworkers I had there were fantastic. I had to leave because I was moving states and I still keep in contact with them.However, management (above my team lead) was awful - they went in and took away people’s chairs and destroyed boxes people were sitting on during breaks/when machines were done. Haier (company that owns GE now) is genuinely an evil company and GE only really cares about numbers and profits. JOIN THE UNION"
GE,Replacement worker,2,Terrible place to work honestly they don’t care about there employees at all the supervisors talk to you any kind of way also they take advantage of you… if you work there don’t make it a long time hurry up and get out!!
GE,Piping Supervisor,4,The company is well established and visionary so the culture is about being being cutting edge on all fronts in a highly competitive environment which is challenging on all hands but the effectiveness of their systems makes life and progress achievable 
GE,CNC Machinist,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The People, the sharing of knowledge and experience along with the atmosphere of the company.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Keeping up with changing of policies What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great work atmosphere and great trainersWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Getting my assignment meeting with my supervisor to know the production for the day. Running my job and keeping up with the line for the day"
GE,Administrative,2,Management was not responsive to the needs of customers or employees. Management created constant chaos because there was never any follow through on one plan. Processes were changed constantly with no end in sight. Toxic managers ruled the roost. 
GE,Machine Operator,2,If you're reading this and want to work for GE Aerospace please do not move your family down here for this job. If you are in high school thinking about coming to work here please explore other options. All this place does is send work to mexico and China and you constantly have to worry about your job every single day. The pay is good and the benefits are decent. Please do not move here for this job. All they do is tell you how good the plant is doing but we could do better. Do not work for this company if you want to go home every single night worrying about your job. 
GE,Appliance Delivery and Installation,5,I learned how to deliver appliances at this job and it is a skill that has helped me make money for years to come. To this day the knowledge I gained is in use.
GE,General Labor,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The people are good and it's a good job What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Transportation  to get there on the bus What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Good u just be to close to other people What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work hard and follow the rules
GE,Treasury Analyst,4,"I enjoyed my time working for this company.  I learned a lot, but there were few opportunities to grow professionally so I decided to move on.Salary and benefits are good, and some managers are very flexible."
GE,Senior Operations Manager,5,"If you want to work with great people and great technology, you should consider GE despite it's recent setbacks.  Over my lengthy career at GE Aviation, one thing was consistent - highly talented employees came to work every day and tried to solve complex problems and succeeded more times than they failed."
GE,Financial Analyst,4,"In general the company has a good culture. Overall within the department, people in the organization are helpful with relatively good benefits for employees "
GE,Appliance Technician,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The best part was getting off work they reel you in but once in they give off a heavy good ole boy type of vibe and if you don’t obey they fire you What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The lead tech is very annoying and if new heavy micro management What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Good-ole boy country culture if you don’t hunt, fish or camp they think something is wrong with you What is a typical day like for you at the company?Mirror my trainer untill they could trust me on my own"
GE,Assembly Worker,1,I like working at factories but this place is not the place they nickel and dime you do t tell you what you are doing in advance they just throw you in a section it’s hard to move up or you never will their is a hostile work environment every where and if you don’t work for GE and work threw a hiring agency they treat you like dirt they act like safety is a concern but it’s honestly not and they tell you over time is optional but if you do t come in you get marked for absence 
GE,ASNT Level III/ Quality Engineer,5,Great place to work. Very busy and days went by quickly. Good people to work with for the most part.From NDT perspective Level II technicians should be direct reports to the Responsible NDT Level III  in Quality not under production control.
GE,Technician,2,Technician - working hours is office hours for automation technician.Work wise need to have own initiative.Working hours is 0730am-420pmA lot of good colleagues.
GE,Manufacturing Engineer,1,"Once a prestigious company now in shambles. The management in manufacturing at GE is a joke. They promote a bunch of losers that werent cool in college and now they are trying to be cool the second time around. Greenville plant is a toxic and if you arent in the good ole boys club, you will never succeed. "
GE,Application Architect,4,"A typical day at work lasts 12 or more hours. Busy calendars. Many daily calls and meetings, people are often double and triple booked for calls. Learning is available to those who are willing and able to carve out time from their very busy schedules. Management styles vary widely depending on the person. The culture is obsessed with delivery at any cost. Sometimes, at a cost incurred to quality of the deliverables. The work-life balance is virtually non-existent. Working for a legendary conglomerate used to provide the sense of pride and motivation."
GE,Securities Analyst,4,Great place to work while it lasted!  I wish it was still around as this company gave me a lot.   Thank you General Electric for a memorable and impactful 20 years!

GE,Manager,5,There was a great collaborative work environment with lots of support from Senior management.  Great incentive programs for staff.  Employees were valued.
GE,Validation Engineer,3,"Loved my job, but after I left I found out much money could be made elsewhere.  The unlimited vacation was nice too.  When they froze the pension, management was asked how they will retain talent, and their response was they don't think they'll lose it."
GE,Product Manager,4,"Worked with some great people - smart and talented. Offset by some who slack off and try to learn to code on the job - these got weeded out later tho. Leadership who set direction were either non-visionary or tainted by their own personal gains. Could've been great with better top leadership. Left but had good memories, experience, and friends. "
GE,Administrative Assistant,4,Working at GE was great.  It is the type of organization that grants their employees opportunity to grow especially if you have the drive and willingness to explore and learn.  
GE,IT Manager,5,"Ge allowed me to grow and develop professionally, in addition to the excellent benefits on the law, I began working as a contractor and ended up doing a great professional career."
GE,sourcing,2,company spun off went thru too many job eliminations to countall they did was lay off people and those that remained were given their workhigh pressure
GE,Production Operator,4,"Great people to work for, good RELIABLE hours, some days you get a 2 hr delay. Only bad thing is HR team doesn’t help out a bunch and is hard to get hired on."
GE,Final Electrical Test,5,Great company to work for.  Work is steady and manageable.  You are always learning something new and the day is never boring.  Management is great and understanding co-workers are happy and joyful. 
GE,Senior Manager,3,Great place to learn and grow. Innovation is at the heart of GE. Patches of good and bad managers. 360 degree review of managers should help managers to learn how to manage staff.
GE,Production Worker,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Company is very laid back and you receive your benefits on day 1 for new hires. The work is very simple and easy to pick up. The company gives out merchandise every so often and it’s a family type environment. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The heat during the summer months can be rough, some buildings don’t have central ac but the company will extend break times if it’s too hot. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Family oriented and everyone helps each other out. I’ve seen team leaders and managers jump on a line to help out the associates if need be.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Easy and laid back, they prioritize your safety over anything."
GE,IT Help Desk Technician ,5,GE really does value its employees they always give us the room to grow. The work environment is great management cares about their employees and they are always trying to find ways to make the work better. 
GE,Senior Operations Manager,5,"If you want to work with great people and great technology, you should consider GE despite it's recent setbacks.  Over my lengthy career at GE Aviation, one thing was consistent - highly talented employees came to work every day and tried to solve complex problems and succeeded more times than they failed."
GE,Customer Service Representative,1,"No growth, pay is good if you're a teen in highschool , typical day? Getting yelled at by customers and management No flexibility, no resources to leadership, very clickish, favorites are played"
GE,Machine Operator,1,I used to promote this company to everyone. Good pay and hours. But you could work there for years and be let go without a single thought. Poor Management all around.
GE,Manager,3,Good place to work and enjoyable place can work at least for 3 years and have good growth and good knowledge sharing by the company to its employees…..
GE,Service Technician,5,Ge had build a great culture for their employees. There are many opportunities for growth. Benefits are great management is also great no micromanagement.

GE,Sales,4,"Worked for them for approximately 3 years and really enjoyed my time there.  GE is a big company, so not uncommon for there to be overlap in certain areas."
GE,Consumer Relations Specialist,3,"This position is not for the faint at at heart. Let's put it this way, you have 10 weeks of training and then anoth 6 months to get prapared for this role. This role is mentally exhausting. Customers have valid complaints but it's your job to basically say no, we will just continue servicing you broken appliance repratedly unyil your warranty is no longer valid. The pay is way below standard for what is required to do well at this role. Only pay's $17hr while this position should easily be a 50-60k position based on the technical side of it alone. "
GE,Customer Service Representative,1,Guest yell and there’s no support. You take every single call and direct them where to go. Technicians miss appointments and you get the backlash. No manager support 
GE,Engineer,5,Good company overall. The focus on safety is appreciated. Some departments work harder than others. Internal promotions should be focused on more rather than outside. 
GE,Diseñador,5,"Excellent work environment, good salary (at least fixed) and good growth opportunities. It is a company that cares about their employees, they have planned family activities and in general it is a good atmosphere"
GE,Intern,2,"It was a monotonous, boring job.The workers are quickly replaced, relatively flexible, but they do not remain long.University was Jo, the payer was not tul high"
GE,Ingeniero de Proyectos,5,"It is a good place to work, benefits and competitive salary, flexible schedules and opportunity to learn from different manufacturing processes"
GE,Engineer,4,"As my first job out of college, I learned a lot of strong professional and management skills that I still carry with me to this day.   This is where GE excels.   Opportunities for growth and promotion are limited unless you are based at headquarters.   "
GE,Field service engineer,5,"The company is massive and holds opportunities for career growth. The work ethic is deeply rooted as you would expect from GE. Overall great experience and onboarding, training and coworkers always there to help. Great company to work for in this day and age. "
GE,Cell Specialist,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?The pay was great and there is a nurse, massage therapist and gym onsite.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The putting tooling together that isn’t ergonomically friendly or safe. Also, expectations of speaking the MOS to the router, to the computer is ridiculous. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Some coworkers were ok but some were arrogant egotistical people.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Not good and that is all I want to say."
GE,ND,1,Not the best. Less interested in improvements than maintaining status quo and avoiding notice by higher management for any reason. Most were just looking for a role to hide in until retirement
GE,Assembly Line Operator,5,"It’s a tough manual work with a lot of working with tools and I have had a few mess ups so just stay vigilant, your handling dangerous equipment. However you will be trained and if you do your job you will be more than fine, if you get along then it’ll make time pass by "

GE,Monteur,5,14 years old The top and a great adventure with them unfortunately my health will force me to stop but I will keep a very good memory and a very good experience
GE,Engineer,1,All good engineers found a way to leave the toxic environment. Epic management failures ruined the once good company. Unbelievable that there is anyone wanting to do business with the circus that remains.
GE,Cyber Security Engineer,4,"Good management , good corporate structure, average pay, good work life balance.Decent opportunities within the company , although the process of going through one internally is not the best."
GE,Lead Engineer,5,"Working in After market service. One of the best company, which gives excellent career growth. I am privileged to be a part of this wonderful company. Thank you."
GE,Assembler,4,Good place to work. Lots of things to learn. Good benefits. Fast paced environment. They usually conducting meetings and you can put you suggestions for the improvement.
GE,Product Security Analyst,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?I loved working at GE and plan to return to one of the newly independent GE companies as soon as possible. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?It’s a huge company, so there is a lot of bureaucracy. HR and leadership, in my experience, do value the people and support good work-life balance. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Depends on you immediate manager and one over. I had a few bad managers, but one over listened and made changes."
GE,Especialista en Regulaciones Técnicas,5,"What is the best thing to work in the company? Benefits and development plans What is the most stressful of working in the company? It is still a large company, in which sometimes you are one more number. How is theEnvironment and work culture in the company? Well, relaxed, progressive and competitive, how is a typical day for you in the company? 1st level offices, flexibility to work from home.Cordial relationship with superiors"
GE,Cell Specialist,5,"The benefits are good at GE. There is plenty of work and overtime is almost always available. The building in Beavercreek is brand new, so that's a plus to working there."
GE,Field service Engineer ,5,The working environment is really above many companies that I have worked with. Employer very close to its employees.Easy evolution if skills are there
GE,Operations Manager,3,"This was my first ""big kid"" job out of college so I was thankful to have it and pretty much any job that paid a decent wage at the time as I was begging to freak out about student loans. So I accepted it without any salary negotiation. It gave me Operations experience when I had none so I am thankful for that. 100% it was your typical corporate BS. Lots of higher of people not knowing or caring what the what low level workers were doing to keep the department going. We however did have one supervisor who was excellent. But as corporate goes, he was recruited to another company not long after I started. In the total time I worked there (4 years) I had 4 different managers cycle through).Pros: Lots of opportunities for growth and great benefits package, lots of sick timeCons: Typical corporate mentality where the top is overly heavy, super small raises for lower levers, think under $1 per year, constant policy changesOverall not a bad place to start of stay if you want a to use as a step stone."
GE,Financial Sales Consultant,5,Healthy work environment with extensive corporate training.   Positive reinforcement and great at team building..  promotes a general happy place to work nd cohesion among work force 
GE,Mechanic,2,"If you like to work long hours, no days off, and watch management run the place to the ground this is the place for you.  Unfortunately, management does not see the value of their blue-collar employees. "
GE,Solution Leader,5,"Even as GE sells and spins-off businesses, this is a great and dynamic place to work with people working hard to solve real problems even in uncertain situations."
GE,B Technician,3,"Once the new manager stepped in, it's has gone down hill. Low morale, special treatment and work the good to workers to death. No extra money for crane operators. Shady"
GE,Field Service Technician,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The best part was the training. 1996started training and was sent to Georgia from Flint Michigan. Was a very exciting time for me to learn new things. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?That was when they closed up the door and I left and went to Sears and continued my training on all sorts of appliances. And retired in 2005.and still working. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The company was a easy going on process of training and keeping up with new and different appliances. The culture was tiffrec couldn't get a better job . I owe my father's training verry dear to me starting out as child in a family business. Holding a lead light for my father. And starting out a New adventure in my life. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Listen to the customers complaints and solving there problems and fixing there machine. Was very rewarding and sometimes not . My father use to say smile and make them happy and they will call u again to fix something else. Repeat bisness was are goal to succeed. And be kind to those who are not.
GE,Engineering Intern,5,"great place, very stimulating. Well compensated for the role. Work with like minded people towards a common goal. Dealing with union employees can be difficult. "
GE,Material manager,5,Working day never ends the cell phone always sounds to be autonomous and manage alone direction to give you no support versus the customer sector very secure no support from the manager to have a high caliber position thanks to my hard work
GE,Assembly Line Worker,4,"it is all easy work, the only bad thing i would say is it was so easy that if you are on night shift it’s hard to stay awake, so i would recommend bringing headphones to listen to music. everything is really laid back and easy "

GE,Senior Operations Manager,5,"If you want to work with great people and great technology, you should consider GE despite it's recent setbacks.  Over my lengthy career at GE Aviation, one thing was consistent - highly talented employees came to work every day and tried to solve complex problems and succeeded more times than they failed."
GE,Field Specialist,1,Terrible un-trustworthy management.They treat you like a number on a spread sheet. The Gearbox team is full of know it alls that think they’re better than everyone
GE,Director,4,"Rating during my time there. Last employed there in 2016. Company has improved over the years but during my last year it was difficult due to financial challenges. At that time, compensation wasn’t competitive"
GE,Implementation Manager,4,Had amazing coworkers that I worked with around the world. Did some interesting software implementations that had unique challenges per specific requirements in certain countries. The only con was the lack of processes and expertise in the Finance and Accounting departments.
GE,Process Operator,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Good benefits,Good wages,attendance quarterly bonus,401K etc.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not too stressful ,I will reiterate, not to stress full!What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's kind of laid back,about 60% white ,25% black,15% espanic!What is a typical day like for you at the company?Come in to work, work safely, and go home !"
GE,Machinist,3,Raised a family working here.  No difference in pay between a hard worker or a lazy one.  No real incentive to innovate or be more productive than your peers.  Good money in the b rates like I was but the new n rate pay for new employees is not as good
GE,Alternant,3,The company is correct but is not suitable for young employees seeking a dynamic and modern service.Apprentices' salaries are higher than the average
GE,Ingénieur Qualité Projet,3,"What is the most pleasant laspect in working in this business? Integrity and respect with people who can help in each structure What is the most stressful laspecation in working in this company? No continuous improvement process.No personnel integration into internal, customers and certifications that it would describe the work and culture in this company? Open space: everyone works together not locked up but respect for silence is difficult for what your day oftypical work in this company? Take your time, still waiting"
GE,Administratif,3,Good remuneration but special atmosphere. MANAGEMENT TO REVIEW: Manager not always competent and who were not attentive.
GE,AVP,4,Interesting place to work after MBA.  Smart people.  Learned a ton.  Great training.  Paid well and had a pretty good company culture.  Was seeking a smaller company environment.
GE,Senior Engineering Manager,2,"Too many police officers that occupy people and keep them away from main stains, execution projects"
GE,Machinist Operator,3,"It is a good place to work, but upper management wants to control everything. Including the quantity. Problem is they don't understand the issues we have. It not about Quantity, its about quality."
GE,Security Manager,4,"GE as you may know has changed a lot across the years, and today is far of their golden years still at the beginning of the 2000s, but its culture due to how strong it was does remains, so getting a good job here is a good option."
GE,Ensambladora,5,"What is the best thing to work in the company? Tremendous company.In addition to excellence with customers, he also cares about their employees.What is the most stressful of working in the company?

GE,Manager,4,"Great people to work with. Productive environment. Typical fast paced, high stress Manufacturing work. Good place to grow and build relationships. Not a good long term career. "
GE,Production Worker,3,Fast paced. Continuously changing. Profit driven company. Opportunity to do different jobs/skills. Tuition reimbursement program. Leadership roles available. 
GE,Analyste financier,4,The working conditions were pleasant and the missions interesting.The group allows good possibilities of evolution all over the world
GE,Marketing Manager,5,Great place to work with wonderful benefits and pay and people and great career progression and valuable learning experiences and mentoring opportunities
GE,Asembly line worker,3,Nice home and work life balance. Not enough money and barely any ot since I’ve started working there. Management is laid back. Overall pretty chill place to work.
GE,Biomedical Equipment Technician,3,"A good place to work.  A company that's been in business for over a 100 years has systems in place and continues to refine. Decent benefits package with lots of paid days off, matching 401k and training facilities in Milwaukee. Access to Staples that deliver all the sparking water, coffee and snacks you can handle. Well managed but not micromanaged. "
Target,Checkout Advocate,4,"If you're mostly doing checkout then it's and extremely easy job, but from time to time the hours are pretty lousy. Good first job for young people, not too much stress."
Target,Cart Attendant,3,Great staff and the job is pretty easy. As long as you don’t get too grossed out about cleaning. The only problem I encountered was lack of moving up in the company from the position. But that was just my experience
Target,General Merchandiser,5,Fun and chill place to work at. Not too strict. Just get your job done and you should be more than fine. Good hours but does slow down after holiday season.
Target,Sales Associate,3,"Honestly, I had mostly friends from High School working there, but the other people who I did not know were kind of stuck up. Management was great when I worked there, but ever since one of them left, it was terrible. Thankfully I didn’t last long there anyway. "
Target,Cashier,5,"Working at Target was an incredibly rewarding experience that offered a range of opportunities for professional growth, personal development, and community engagement. There were several key factors that contributed to this positive experience.First and foremost, Target’s strong focus on team culture made it a welcoming and supportive work environment. The collaborative nature of the job allowed me to form strong relationships with colleagues, and the company fostered an inclusive culture where everyone’s contributions were valued. Regular team meetings and open lines of communication with managers made it easier to address any concerns and provided opportunities to share feedback."
Target,Manager,5,"I started as a cashier. Target was very flexible with my hours. Including switching my hours when my kids were out of school for the summer. I enjoyed cashiering and talking with the guests. I soon was moved to guest service, to do returns and handle any issues the guest need help with.  Soo. The talk od promoting me started. The executives helped me prepare of interviews  to help the process along. Everyday was a great learning experience. Target was like a family."
Target,Customer Service Representative,1,"No over time and made to work during Covid, did not provide enough hours and did not take care of employees. Had to get a second job, because I didn’t want management. They refused to write a letter to my leasing office as to why they could not provide more hours, since I was not able to pay the rent during Covid. Horrible experience doing drive up orders during Covid. "
Target,General Merchandiser,2,"Your job is very repetitive and the management is not good unfortunately. Few bright spots here and there, but overall not a fun place to work. Bosses talk down to you, take no accountability, and are overbearing at times. Team Leads are cool but not a fan of SD and most ETLs. "
Target,Cashier,5,Good here to work.no stress really just fun and love. Had alot of break time. No problems tho. I found a very cool cashier job.The items were expensive tho especially for kids stuff
Target,Sales Floor Team Member,3,Tough to get enough hours. You Need pretty much open availability to get a decent amount of hours.  Target must really not want to pay for benefits.  
Target,Fulfillment Associate,2,Team leads VERY passive aggressive to new hires with no patience. They will call you slow and hassle you while you’ve only been there a couple weeks.  Many of employees are unhappy and anxious all the time because of this but no one wants to say anything . Never had a job make me cry my first couple days for trying to chew me out on my speed even though I made the timer mark and didn’t miss stowing. They have unrealistic expectations for new hires. A respectful and good manager will keep employees while new hires quit left and right here . 
Target,Starbucks Barista,5,"Pay started out well at $15hour. Baristas weren't allowed to accept tips, which was a bummer, but overall I had many opportunities to pick up extra shifts as a shopper or helping with the backstock area. They offered training in different departments for those that wanted more experience or different hours. They were super accommodating to my shift preferences. Working in the Starbucks was a lot of fun because Poppy would encourage us to try new drinks that came out and get creative with our add ins. She was always super understanding and helpful. I felt like I was supported while working there. "
Target,Cashier,4,Good place to work at. There are no issues. I love this place. My family shops here. This is where we do grocdries and buy clothes and diapers. No complaints
Target,Style Team Member,1,"Overall you’ll be doing the same thing everyday,and no matter how much you work you will not get noticed.terrible team leads and higher ups. Very hard to get a promotion and even if your interested in being a team lead you’ll surely regret it working for Target "
Target,Fulfilment Expert,3,"The store was an overall decent place to work - it's the ETL in Fulfillment that drain you. They get mad at you for being unable to meet goals, that were set up for you to fail. They'll hire people and put them all over the store and leave them out of the place where they NEED people. Orders will sit until they are in the RED and when you get to them, you'll be late - bringing your numbers down. The ETL will also let those orders sit and tell everyone else to get them. "
Target,Online Fulfillment Associate,2,"I worked mornings part-time picking products for shipment or pick-up. More times than not the products are not on the shelf. When that happens you have to find it. Search dressing room area, guest service area, and boxes that just came off the truck. Yes, you have to rummage through the boxes trying to find the one item. AND you are timed will doing this. They expect you to pick way more than is possible. Then at the end of your shift every day they tell you what your ""numbers"" were and that you need to improve. So defeating. Glad to be out of there."
Target,Group Leader,5,"Very good environment with a focus on teamwork, operational execution and leadership development.  Training and SOPs were well designed and feedback was given to improve performance."
Target,Front End Associate,2,"I would only recommend working here if you have nothing else, or to gain experience in sales to use it for a better job in sales. other than that you will be slaving away making 15 dollars an hour with pennies for rasies every year unless you get lucky enough to be a team leader which is only 4 to 5 dollars raise."
Target,Sr. Human Resources Specialist,3,"Target Flow Center in Hampton,Ga is a new facility that has a long way to go. Very hard to move up in HR… pay is competitive… health benefits could be better "
Target,Team Member,3,". One major issue is the pressure to meet high performance standards while managing a heavy workload. Employees often face long hours on their feet, dealing with customer service demands, stocking shelves, and maintaining store cleanliness, which can be physically exhausting. Additionally, the scheduling can be unpredictable, leading to difficulties in balancing work with personal life. Limited opportunities for advancement and benefits can also contribute to a lack of job satisfaction. Together, these factors can create a stressful work environment that may deter potential employees."
Target,Apparel and Accessories Team Member,3,"I worked at Target in high school and college. The pay is great for a young adult in that phase of life. The job itself was fine but I always felt like I was being micromanaged or “watched” while I was working. Some people were favorited by management as well. Overall, a great job for someone in high school or college but I would never go back to that. "
Target,Checkout Advocate,4,"If you're mostly doing checkout then it's and extremely easy job, but from time to time the hours are pretty lousy. Good first job for young people, not too much stress."
Target,Fulfillment Associate,2,"I’ll keep this short, the management at this store is horrible. They hold petty grudges and have painfully obvious favorites. They go into a panic the second the store gets busy but refuse to hire an adequate amount of employees. On top of the store culture the Target system was outdated and never made sense. Example: you could only see your sick and vacation hrs from your pay stub. The schedule is also week to week so if there’s a miss punch you better get that fixed before Saturday."
Target,Specialty Sales Team Lead,1,"Workplace culture is nonexistent. They don’t care about you as a person. All that matters is metrics. There is no work life balance, good luck if you’re a parent. Vacations will get denied for no actual reason, but management will definitely take theirs. Your schedule is never consistent. They REQUIRE you to let them know 3 weeks in advanced if your availability changes or if you need a day off it HAS to at least be a month ahead (they’ll still most likely deny it) and then turn around and change your schedule a day before and give you no communication on it and expect you to check your schedule daily. No one respects you. It has caused joy only me but so many others anxiety on a daily basis. "
Target,Guest Service Associate/Trainer,4,"Specifically my store. Management is meh, and staff is cool. Problem is the hours not mine but the whole stores. I work alone most days because we somehow dont have enough hours to give to get me some back up which seems unreasonable how we dont have enough hours. They expect too much from me and I feel used."
Target,Service & Engagement Team Leader,3,"You will be given contradictory and unrealistic expectations, with the absolute bare minimum payroll possible most of the time. You are expected to deliver results that are simply not possible given the traffic level and size of the team. Goals for each department conflict with each other, which breeds resentment amongst leadership and team members. Positive achievements are rarely recognized or are overshadowed by the small things that could have been done better. If you bring up concerns, they are usually used against you, rather than used to address core issues. "
Target,Team Lead,1,"""Management"" if you can call them that is pathetic,  OM's new or seasoned think they know more than anybody else everyone of them have a God complex, it's quite sad. I stayed at the Logan flow center for over 3 years only because of the pay, but I just recently quit because they were trying to figure a way to fire me."
Target,Cashier,4,good job for in college to pay the bills. cowokers were fun to work with. no real opportunities for career advancement unless you have a degree and go to managment.
Target,Fufillment Associate,3,It’s an ok job. I worked Fufillment which is pretty easy but can be demanding during Christmas time. The biggest issue is they will cut hours. So it’s perfect for those looking for a second job. 
Target,Executive Team Leader,3,"For better or worse, right now promotions above lower hourly management level are almost exclusively for female and “diverse” candidates, and that’s only if you’re willing to give up any and all work/life balance. Your welcome to salary management will be 60+ hour weeks where you’re expected to do at least 50% managerial/administrative work, but will be chastised by your boss if you aren’t helping enough with the hourly labor tasks. Used to be a great place to grow and promote, and even as a person of color I think it’s way too political now. "
Target,Warehouse Worker,2,If you can't meet their standards then they will treat you badly. Clear difference in how they talked to me vs other people when I was on an ADA to move out of the department. The accomodations process took a month and a half. It wouldn't have been so bad if there wasn't 60 lb boxes 40 ft in the air while management breathes down your neck about hitting numbers.
Target,Cashier,3,"Fast, fun, friendly. Great place to work, if committed, there's is chance for growth. Good starting rate, great first job for kids. Usually work with availability."
Target,General Merchandiser,2,"I have worked about a decade in retail and Target is the best place I have worked in that aspect.  People are nice which not only includes fellow workers but customers as well.  It's definitely better than places like Walmart where the customers are entitled and demanding and coworkers are stressed out.  With that being said, Target's 90 day probation period sucks and management will get rid of you for any reason they want.  I was let go randomly in this probation period without any notice.  Some of the managers there are awful too. I enjoyed every other aspect of working there though. "
Target,Sales Floor Associate,4,Definitely felt appreciated and recognized for my work. Always felt behind though (at least in the clothing part of the store). Back up cashiered a lot!
Target,Laborer,3,"Working at Target offers steady hours and a team-oriented environment. Tasks can be repetitive, but the company provides good benefits and opportunities for growth."
Target,Runner,3,"As a runner at Target, the job involves fast-paced work, restocking shelves, and assisting customers. It's physically demanding, but rewarding in a team-oriented environment with good benefits and flexible hours."
Target,Cashier,5,"Worked here when I was in college great atmosphere still have friends from when I worked here years later, great environment  and fun to work here would "
Target,Starbucks Barista,5,I felt like my leads and hr actually cared about me. When I moved stores I missed them so much. It was hard work but so worth it because everyone was held to the same standards. It made everything easy because everyone was doing their job. I looked forward to work everyday. No issues with scheduling whatsoever. People got time off even if it was overlapping. Our hours never got messed up. I miss this store everyday. 
Target,Guest Advocate,4,"The job itself is pretty simple and straightforward. If you're working outside doing carts or OPU it can get tough, especially during the heat. Drink plenty of water, bring lots of water even if you don't think you'll need it. When there's a rush you won't have as much time to stop and take a sip, so drink up when you do have some downtime. But otherwise it's not that bad. Coworkers are all pretty chill and scheduling is flexible. Overall decent place to work"
Target,Sales Associate,4,"I worked at Target as a seasonal employee. The store was great, management was always there to help if you needed any assistance or clarification after training. "
Target,Cashier,5,Staff is great people are friendly you just stand there and scan urgent as they come and idk why I have To talk about another company I never even worked for in order to see other reviews this and glass door have terrible ideas of operating. 
Target,Fulfillment Associate,3,"The job itself was fun. The customers were for the most part. Pretty nice. There was an occasional where they got angry at you for no reason, but other than that they were fine"
Target,Checkout Advocate,4,"If you're mostly doing checkout then it's and extremely easy job, but from time to time the hours are pretty lousy. Good first job for young people, not too much stress."
Target,Cashier,3,"Typical retail job, with annoying customers and management that is inconsistent in applying the rules. It is a good job for short term, but not much more."
Target,Fulfillment Associate,1,"During my time at target, they would always ask me to work overtime and really late shifts even though I was not a student. I called out one shift sick and was told if I call out again for any reason they would fire me.  I also could only do 20 hours a week. They would try to schedule me for up to 35 hoursI was 18 years old and had no prior work experience and it was truly the most miserable job to date. Im currently 22. "
Target,Team Member,4,You work hard and don’t get much for raises. Fun co workers but too many managers who can’t decide what they want. Pay is alright but barely enough to survive on 
Target,Cashier,5,great place to work at the employees are nice and they teach you the job well and that is very helpful and it made me very happy to work there and I am grateful
Target,Guest Advocate,2,"The managers are all over the place. Poor communication,  irresponsible scheduling, weak leadership. Not somewhere you’d want to work very long at all."
Target,Customer Service Representative,4,"Can be a fun spot to work with the right crew. Hectic at times as managers tend not to schedule properly and fail to assist the front when needed. Avoid drive up at all costs, Target failed creating that as well as adding starbucks to it.  "
Target,Target Tech,4,Areas is rough but the team members are great.  Hard work at the end of the year. A lot of solicitors. Schedule is pretty consistent if u give them your availability.
Target,I don't have one,1,Communication is  basically non-existent .  One person will tell you what to do then another person will tell you something different.  They will hire you for one job and then move you.  There are not enough employees to do all the work so the expectations are unreasonable. The best thing about the job is that the guest (customers) are usually nice.
Target,Guest Advocate/Cashier,4,"Started as a cashier in the beginning, then go moved to order pick-up. Great team. Loved working with them. Good hours. Left because manager at the time was kind of eh. Plus, the OPU section was never really thought of at times, so rushes were definitelyyyy rushing lols"
Target,Closing Expert,4,"Was part time employeeFun job, they stressed the little things to much, and often seems like nobody communicated with each otherEnjoyed my time there, would go back if needed to"
Target,General Merchandise Associate ,4,It’s a retail job so there are good and bad days. There is often no important communication between leaders. But if you’re in a general merch roll and not a specialty dept. it’s easy to go home at the end of the day without constantly think about work. 
Target,Style Consultant,4,"Very supportive managers and team leaders. The job itself is easy but can be very overwhelming sometimes. But with a good team, it makes the job easier."
Target,Guest Service Advocate,3,"Not organized, terrible at scheduling so always having to take breaks late, leaders and staff love drama, pretty easy job overall but wouldn't recommend for a long term job it burns you out."
Target,General Merchandise Expert,4,A very well organized company with clear expectations and good support. Flexible scheduling. Management can be difficult to work with but the people make it worth it. 
Target,Style Consultant,2,"The job itself is not bad, but the management is honestly terrible and favoritism is a HUGE problem here. I genuinely liked my job in the beginning until now. "
Target,Warehouse Associate,4,"If you do your job and don’t goof off, it’s a pretty great place to work. It’s hard work, but it’s enjoyable. They put a lot of emphasis on safety and teamwork."
Target,Janitor,1,"Okay atmosphere, productive. It’s sn overall decent place to work. There is plenty of opportunity to grow if you are searching for career advancement."
Target,Cashier,3,Basic job with benefits. Nothing too crazy or great about it. You have to be able to deal with different types of people and be on your legs all day. 
Target,Cashier/Customer Service,4,"I found the job that I worked should be consistent. The training I received when I spent the time there was appropriate. I felt that management was considerate of availability and they worked with you with your schedule. I found the job to be sometime repetitive, but it was not a job that I found to be boring."
Target,Team Member,4,"Every employee is very nice and pleasant to work with. Pay and hours could be better, especially if you have a lot of responsibilities and things that need to be paid. Great for teenagers. Overall good job. "
Target,Checkout Advocate,4,"If you're mostly doing checkout then it's and extremely easy job, but from time to time the hours are pretty lousy. Good first job for young people, not too much stress."
Target,General Merchandise,5,"GM was a chill position, better than sfs atleast. They hire seasonal employees between summer and fall so thats your best bet to apply to the company."
Target,Register Worker,5,Really fun and productive workplace. I loved all my co-workers and the pay was fine. I just worked the register really simple stuff you know what I mean
Target,CSR - Customer Service Representative,5,Great customer service support. Good prices. Good food lol. New products daily. Fun fun fun and great opportunity. You can’t go wrong shopping here. Thanks 
Target,Associate,5,"What is the best part of working at the company? The hands on constant maneuvering and movement was one of my favorite things working there. Working and and getting paid to do it in a safe fun environment What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Making sure trailers are loaded properly in a timely matter with no mistakes What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Fun, energetic, fast paced,well managed with all kinds of different people all striving to do the job well and accurately"
Target,Cashier/Customer Service,2,"It always smelt like sweat, the managers didn’t know how to train me so I was constantly confused. When I’d ask questions to confirm they would say “what did I just tell you?” even though they never said that. Quit after 2 weeks because the management was AWFUL!!!!!"
Target,General Merchandiser,5,"In my experience working at this Target, the work environment is really nice. Everyone knows what they have to do since we literally do the same thing every day. They accommodate for students really well. You won't get 40 hours, but the pay is still really good if you're not going to school. Even if you mess up, the leads aren't as harsh as the reviews say (my personal experience). I would say if you're looking for a first time job to apply here."
Target,Assets Protection Team Leader,3,"It's overall not a terrible job, but you risk either breaking the rules or not meeting arbitrary metrics. If you don't promote or terminate in a year, something's off."
Target,Beauty Consultant,1,"I worked for a location that ended up closing, so my experience is very limited but I did not enjoy working for them. I know others have had more positive experiences, but if you are looking for genuine relationship building with customers, flexible schedules, and open creativity with sales this is not for you. "
Target,Team Member/Cashier,3,"Worked at Target for 5 years between two stores. First 3 years I worked at a small format Target, which was great. Management was super friendly and down-to-earth and I liked all my coworkers. Last 2 years was at a regular store and it was... fine. Coworkers were great but management got worse the with time, as did the available hours. Overall a fine job. Best thing I can say is they were very accommodating of any changes in availability but YMMV "
Target,Beauty Consultant,4,"I loved working here but it was draining bc they use a model as if your area is your own personal shop. So you do everything from stocking, cleaning, price changes, ect. Pay is good"
Target,Food and Consumables Associate,1,It is horrible. The boss is rude and disorganized and they do not value their team members at all. They expect everything to get done perfectly while they sit and watch and do nothing to assist.
Target,Warehouse Worker,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Pay, benefits and schedule.   What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The management is literally the worst I’ve ever experienced, from top to bottom they will hire anyone off the street to do anything there while the micro management and expectation is at a North Korean level of control.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very loud, dirty, back stabby and very Un empathetic What is a typical day like for you at the company?Long, exhausting, dirty, Un appreciated."
Target,Specialty Sales Associate,2,Was great at first but after new management took over workload heavily increased as many quit in different departments/positions. Store director would act nice but was pretty disingenuous. Only good thing was your coworkers.
Target,Tech Consultant,5,"The job can get frantic with many simultaneous responsibilities requiring quick decision-making and careful organization of priorities, but it's a fun challenge and you really feel like part of a team."
Target,Inbound,1,"Inbound is depressing watching people do hard manual labor for minimum wage, they have unrealistic time frames  for the unload. The team leads don’t gift af about safety, no one helps if your area gets slammed. I was the longest employee and I was only there for less than six months. "
Target,Fulfillment Associate,5,"Love fullfilment, just like shopping but for others! You have to make sure to pick up your pace so you don’t fall behind on orders because everyone can see."
Target,Fulfillment Associate,3,"Long tough hours during the holidays where you'd never be able to slow down from the second you stepped into the store, good pay though and an increase for the holiday season"
Target,General Merchandise Expert,3,"At first , leaders will guide you but training can be limited.  Team leaders will give their favorite team members more hours.  Too many tasks to fulfill for 1 position and the time frame to fulfill is unrealistic.  "
Target,Guest Service Associate,4,"I’ve worked at target for several years now and can say that the work load is constantly shifting. It truly is a fun environment and you have amazing leaders that train you in every department. There is opportunities to grow such as cross training in other departments and leveling up to a team leader after a few years of working here. One thing I do wish was different would be the hours, they drastically change and make it difficult to keep a steady income, but they do also have major flexibility and can accommodate your schedule. "
Target,Cashier,4,"It was amazing, great way to make fast cash! Coworkers are nice. Management strict but you can work around that pretty easy. All around highly recommend!"
Target,Checkout Advocate,4,"If you're mostly doing checkout then it's and extremely easy job, but from time to time the hours are pretty lousy. Good first job for young people, not too much stress."
Target,Warehouse Associate,3,"Easy work, Cool people to work with but management isn't the best. Liked my shift until they made me switch shifts from day to night making it hard to stay there. decent job but dont recommend for a career"
Target,Style Team Member,4,Fun and relaxed can be stressful at times when you have a lot of freight but overall I just go in and do what I can.  Would recommend to anyone in need of a flexible work schedule.
Target,No full time,3,No one gets full time hours.  Full-time is 30 hours at TG.  If you are looking for something stable don’t look at target. Target is best for teenagers. 
Target,Crew Member,2,Not enough pay for what is expected of you and very boring. Pick up times where unrealistic and never enough space to store orders. Always short staffed.
Target,Fulfillment Expert,2,It's an ok job the workers are great the management is the issue. Fulfillment is good if you work great under pressure gets easier once you figure out the store layout and where everything is.
Target,Cashier,5,"Place is not a bad work place. They don't give breaks on time. There is favoritism there also. I worked there for about 8 years, turnover is high for the cashiers, and employees on the floor"
Target,Fulfillment Expert,3,Target when I first started working there was in a good spot. You always knew whatever you needed to know. But about half way through my time there; management changed and it became a very ugly place overall. No one had any direction and a lot of the employees had to fend for themselves. Target needs to be better. 
Target,Cashier/Customer Service,5,"Being a Target employee means fostering a welcoming environment, delivering exceptional customer service, and collaborating with a diverse team to achieve success."
Target,Guest Services Advocate,1,"I started at this location over a month before the store officially opened. I worked at the guest services desk and it's not an easy position to fill as a lone employee but typically there was only one person scheduled for that spot. One reason this job was so challenging was guest services station is located in the opposite end of the store from the drive-up station and both of these services default to the guest services employee to fulfill. I  still cannot believe the expectation was for one employee to run the length of the store, which is the length of a football field to retrieve customer orders. Even though management suggested using walkies to communicate to team members for assistance, it was typically the case that the store was understaffed and/or busy so the responsibility was on one person. Guest services staff is also responsible for pick-ups, stocking, and receiving and processing returns which adds up to an incredible amount of walking back and forth. For the pay, the job required too much physically and the training was nonexistent. When we were still stocking the store, management repeatedly talked about having a few days to train on the register and that never happened.  Management repeated that the registers were easy, and I understand that, but during a training period why not have someone nearby when new situations arise? New staff is simply placed at stations and everyone hopes for the best. There are hours of training videos at Target and they detail practicing empathy for customers, which is important but I didn't see empathy toward the workforce. - more..."
Target,Beauty Expert,3,"Turnover rate was high due to my location being in a college town, a good job for young people, not  a lasting career though. Pay wasn't enough o live of of though"
Target,Guest Advocate,3,"Wasn’t too bad. 15 an hour pay, management is okay. Customers are a bit unhinged and rude. Got cussed out multiple times . But leaders had bought food for team members in break room often so it wasn’t too bad"
Target,Associate,3,"Can get busy especially during holidays. Great team members, good benefits, and PTO. Managers are there to assist whenever you need assistance and are understanding. Never any toxic environment within team "
Target,Style Consultant,5,"Worked there for two years. My experience was pleasant. Manager and team lead were great and accommodating. Customer experience wasn't always great, the worst being messy fitting rooms. "
Target,Executive Team Leader,5,Great place to work and room to grow if you put in the work. I have been with Target for over a decade and it has been quite the experience and was given a lot of tools to excel. 
Target,Sales Associate,4,"People here are really nice, mgmt can be tough but you have so many coworkers and people to connect with. It’s fast paced and the shift goes by fast. The leads are really nice."
Target,Guest Advocate,5,"I couldn’t stay long due to injury, but it was easy to get along with coworkers. The trainer was knowledgeable and easy to understand. He showed me how to work the register."
Target,Safety Manager,3,"good benefits, good pto, lots of room to grow your career if you want it. big focus on networking. will pay for school and personal development. at times high turnover in management positions. "
Target,Guest advocate ,2,"I loved working here but it was very hard to get the hours I needed, I told them I couldn’t live off of 5 hours a week and they basically laughed in my face "
Target,Food and Beverage Associate,3,"Leadership here is very lackluster, there are almost no efforts being made to improve productivity and the work environment. Lots of micromanaging and a sense that your hard work goes unthanked and unnoitced. "
Target,Fulfillment Associate,2,"It's your typical retail job, full of high expectations with very little payroll to fulfill them. Fast work is always valued over quality work, leading to micro management and disorganized and filthy work spaces. A culture of cutting corners to meet unrealistic demands. "
Boeing,Shipping and Receiving Clerk,4,Good place to work for what I do. Pay and benefits are better than elsewhere.  Can be fast paced and detail oriented.  But I enjoy that. Over all we work as a team and people help each other when needed. Management is hit or miss. I have had very good but also some not so good. Like most places. But if you are a hard worker and show up for work and do not cause problems for yourself it is a good place to work. If you are young or want to get more education they will help you get it!
Boeing,Installer,5,"It is a nice place to build a family. But there are many layoffs to watch out for . Overtime is very nice, there are lot of it. Id say you can move up labor grade "
Boeing,Manufacturing Analyst First Line Leader,4,"Typical work day: Prep all leadership for morning meetings, call teams to support putting out fires, Audit meetings to ensure standardization, prepare data and statistics of company health. Attend meetings, plan priorities for strategic alignment. Assign Work and to meet implementation goals based on priority. Resolve conflict, problem solve, attend meetings and complete any outstanding requests. I learned how to better organize teams and present to leadership.Culture is currently negative. Over abundance of meetings and report outs leaves a gap of communication from product constraints to leadership.Hardest part of job is steady conflict management and politics. Report structure creates systematic issues that create energy spent away from root cause.Enjoyable part of job is using data to overcome the conflict and politics to create solutions for the teams and remove production constraints."
Boeing,Wire Assembler,1,"Training was a joke, and everything you learn in training is wrong. As soon as you get to the floor you are pretty much retrained. Pay is a total joke, very few managers are actually good."
Boeing,Quality Production Specialist,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Pay and benefits are excellent; however the cutter pushed to all employees identified as Seek, Speak and Listen are in name only. I was unjustifiably separated for completing my job as trained. After completing a 60 day I was separated without reason by a remote manager that had been with Boeing for less than 4 months. HR team was not helpful when I approached them and explained the complete situation. There was no third party ombudsman and I am in a right to work state without union representation. In my opinion I was falsely accused of not adhering to the QMS system. However I was not given the proper retraining. There is much more that can be said, but honestly I’m ready to move on and no ethical complaints were made. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Expectations and goals are subjective to managers. As a Lead Quality Production Specialist and given complexity of many inspections output by management was subjective and there was unbelievable pressures on speed versus being complete when attention to detail and a thorough inspection should’ve been the highest priority. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Environment was good based upon facility, but new management teams and culture was horrific. What is a typical day like for you at the company?10 hour grind to complete AOG receivables."
Boeing,Senior Software Engineer,2,Depends on the area you go.  There are areas that are respectful.  Are they interested in training new hires.  No.  Are they interested in your career?  No.  
Boeing,Senior Project Manager,3,Boeing has great benefits. Currently the company is experiencing a lot of difficulties which leads to a lot of uncertainties and low morale. The wage is not as high as it should be. 
Boeing,Assistant Product Acceptance Specialist,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?There really wasn’t one. Unorganized, poor management or complete lack of, favoritism, not holding people accountable, not caring about quality, and NO training. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?They don’t care if you know your job. There is no real training and they for you no time to learn specs and drawings. It’s all about production, committing to at least 8 1/2 hrs of inspections regardless if you have never performed them before. Quality is not important, only production/schedule. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Terrible. Major favoritism, not holding people accountable because they are friends or family and slamming the people who do work with everything. Major pressure for production, not caring at all about quality until there is an outside catch of an issue. No management at all. Not holding the personnel to the so called standards. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stress, being pressured and rushed to complete work regardless of knowledge/training, and zero care for quality. Horrible for people with ethics."
Boeing,Composite Technician,4,"Job was stable, pay was lackluster.  It might be different now in the union states but at the mesa site raises are hard to come by and they actively try to prevent that site from joining a union."
Boeing,Manufacturing Engineer,4,Management needs to be more engaged Quality issues are problematic The companies reputation is at stake Lack of effective executive leadership A friendly working atmosphere The mechanics are being rushed to finish their work and it results in poor quality and workmanship 
Boeing,Heavy Structures Mechanic,2,I disliked my time working at Boeing for 2 years. I left due to the toxic work environment and culture. I have never wanted to quit a company more. Best decision of my life was to leave and forget about that company.
Boeing,Avionics Technician,3,Very laid back workplace but promotions are only for “friends of ours”!! Never the best person for the job. But overall great place to work with EXCELLENT benefits.
Boeing,Quality Assurance Inspector,5,"A typical day starts with team meeting, As QA I learned so much skills to inspector parts and assemblies. The management here is helpful. People respect each other and help each other in need.  I really enjoy under taking my assignments and love to work with my team."
Boeing,Liaison Engineer,5,I have worked with Boeing for over 2 years now and it really is a great job. The engineering group I am in makes me feel like I am using my engineering degree to the fullest. It's a very inclusive group and everyone supports each other. 
Boeing,Janitor,1,You get what they pay for. Boeing delivers innovative aerospace solutions but faces challenges with safety and quality. Their commitment to engineering excellence remains strong.
Boeing,Functional Test Technician,4,"Boeing is a great company to build a career with paid education and fantastic medical/dental/vision plans. In the factory as a mechanic, the management structure has changed a lot over time and could use an overhaul to increase morale and the feeling of being part of a team. It's not everywhere that this is experienced so I don't really count it as a large negative, especially considering that moving into other jobs, programs and locations is easy to do. Boeing is a great place to work if you are looking for a career and not just a job."
Boeing,Server,5,"In excellent atmosphere, good work I recommend for all people, you adapt very fast"
Boeing,Design Engineer,4,easy work that can be interesting provided you find the right team and role. good work life balance and benefits. bureaucratic with some bad managers. 
Boeing,Overhead Crane Operator,3,"Used to be an awesome company to work for, but not so much anymore. Corporate greed, took our pensions and sold out by the IAM union. Have not had a general wage increase in 10 years."
Boeing,Systems Engineer,1,"Really solid work and experience to be gained, but the promotion of toxic managers absolutely ruins the experience. Stay on their good side and you're fine, but if they've had a bad day or if you stand up to their bullying, you'll quickly find yourself without a job. You can report them to HR, but they won't do anything about it and retaliation will happen."
Boeing,QA Inspector,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Building airplanes, the people doing this are highly skilled!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The terrible management treatment of employees!What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work environment is excellent. The culture is gone, replaced by the moronic bean counters & their spreadsheets!What is a typical day like for you at the company?Hide from management who do nothing but waste my time!"
Boeing,Shipping and Receiving Clerk,4,Good place to work for what I do. Pay and benefits are better than elsewhere.  Can be fast paced and detail oriented.  But I enjoy that. Over all we work as a team and people help each other when needed. Management is hit or miss. I have had very good but also some not so good. Like most places. But if you are a hard worker and show up for work and do not cause problems for yourself it is a good place to work. If you are young or want to get more education they will help you get it!
Boeing,Flight readiness Technician ,4,"The work can be physically demanding, but the pay is really good and they're fine if you that a day off. Just have to let them know before you're shift. "
Boeing,Analyst,1,"Working at Boeing has been a rewarding experience overall. The company offers a wealth of opportunities for professional growth, especially through training programs and mentorship initiatives. The emphasis on innovation and teamwork fosters a collaborative environment where ideas are valued."
Boeing,Electrical Engineer,3,"Boeing offers strong technical challenges for electrical engineers, but bureaucracy can hinder innovation. Recognition is lacking, salary increases are infrequent, and bonuses are low, which can affect overall job satisfaction and motivation."
Boeing,Designer,4,Excellent people to work withLots of incentives and a really good clean environment. Work is not overly stressful and their was little turnover which enhances work relationships
Boeing,Wire Group,3,"I enjoyed working there for a year, but it felt more like a Union Cult than an aerospace company manufacturing the future.  In the end, it wasn’t a good fit for me, and I’m glad I left before all the planes started losing their doors in flight."
Boeing,Mechanic,1,"Miserable life and stressful job due to hectic work schedules and management looks for only profits and ignoring the employee's personal life, so look for better job."
Boeing,"Software Automation Engineer, Insite Global Contractor",2,Outdated rules bad mangers of the group I was in.  No flexibility for home work balance. The people I worked with were great. Their was very poor communication with management 
Boeing,Painter,5,Painted airplane parts including a/c vents and many other interior parts of the plane. Daily tasks included mixing paint/primer for parts to be ready for paint and also letting it cure in the oven
Boeing,Engineer,5,Started as an intern and moved to full time. Great opportunities to find the spot in which you fit best. Varied defense platforms to work on and plenty of opportunity for growth. 
Boeing,Assembly Technician/Quality Control Flight Line Inspector,3,I worked there for a long time.  Well longer than I have besides the Military.  It started off awesome.  Best job since the military.  Can't beat the benefits.  I felt truly a family and a team.  Then by 2018 -2020 new hire management came in. The culture changed across the company as a whole.  No longer was it safe to call out bad quality.  That might put the company in a bad light. Good old boy system of promotion started happening.  It all depends on who you knew and what you could promise them instead of what you knew and the potential you brought. Eventually I was asked to resign. Do I blame the company? No. In fact if they offered me my job back I'd take it. They just needed to clean house.  I think they are.
Boeing,Engineer,3,"Most management leaves a lot to be desired. Majority of co-workers are knowledgeable, great people.                                                   "
Boeing,Procurement Financial Analyst,2,"If you do as you are told you will have job security, if you fit in you will have job security. Compensation is great, legacy company so traditional approach to culture. "
Boeing,Supply Chain Specialist II,5,"Aside from great pay and benefits, I could not ask for better coworkers. It is refreshing being on a proactive team, that is passionate and dedicated to supporting the Customer. This is a very fulfilling job ."
Boeing,Account Manager,3,"Working at Boeing has been a solid experience, but it falls short of being exceptional. The company offers decent benefits and job security, which is a big plus. The projects are often interesting and impactful, especially in the aerospace and defense sectors, allowing you to work on technology that truly matters.However, Boeing's work environment can feel a bit rigid, with limited opportunities for innovation or creativity. The bureaucracy sometimes slows down progress, making it harder to implement new ideas. The compensation is fair, but considering the high cost of living in certain locations, it could be more competitive.Career advancement can be slow unless you’re in the right department or have strong connections. Overall, Boeing provides a stable and good work environment, but there is room for improvement, particularly in fostering innovation and providing more competitive salaries. It’s a good place for stability, but not necessarily the best for those looking for rapid career growth or cutting-edge opportunities."
Boeing,Contracts Administrator,5,I can't say enough about the people I work with and for!  I wish I'd come here decades ago.  What an awesome place to work.  I feel empowered to fix anything that I see needs fixing.
Boeing,Aircraft Structures Mechanic,4,"I worked in Position 1, Fwd body join. The jobs great but it is what you make of it. You can choose to learn continually, or not. There can be drama between you and your team or not. Its up to you. Everything else Id say is situational. You do your job, go home or do overtime which is mostly voluntary. "
Boeing,Analyst,1,"Excited about working for Boeing initially. They offered lots of benifits during the interview. Within a very short time of being in the job roles were changed. I did feel I had been catfished at the interview. Comunication is poor within the company with most referrals through complicated remote IT systems.Managment very clicky, I can not say I enjoyed my time with the company at all."
Boeing,Chief Systems Engineer,1,If you have issues or disabilities you are going to have a rough time at Boeing.  Managment can do ANYThING and they cannot be in trouble for it.  Ethics backs management.  There is no change in this to positively affect the environment even when they espouse they know it's messed up.
Boeing,Mechanic,1,If you want to give up your life and be constantly mandated for the weekends and stuck on 2nd shift and don’t want to see your family. This is the place for you. 
Boeing,Supply Chain Analyst,5,"Love Boeing, the people are awesome to work with and the work environment is healthy. Pay and benefits are amazing, too. Couldn’t recommend Boeing more."
Boeing,Shipping and Receiving Clerk,4,Good place to work for what I do. Pay and benefits are better than elsewhere.  Can be fast paced and detail oriented.  But I enjoy that. Over all we work as a team and people help each other when needed. Management is hit or miss. I have had very good but also some not so good. Like most places. But if you are a hard worker and show up for work and do not cause problems for yourself it is a good place to work. If you are young or want to get more education they will help you get it!
Boeing,Embedded Engineer,3,Sometimes projects were interesting but sometimes you were just sitting around burning time.  Pay is also below average and there is return to office.  Overall would not recommend but its okay I guess
Boeing,Quality Control Inspector,1,"I worked my whole life in quality and enjoyed it. QA at Boeing is wrong and I have reported it repeatedly, not working to approved documents, inspecting things with out proper standards, toxic culture. Training was non existent. No one followed the proper specs and they have an unapproved acceptance criteria for shooting titanium tubes that lays around the shop and is instructed by the level III to use. It’s amazing how it’s not been audited, but when it is they are going to be shocked. Over 40 years of CH47 rotor blades been inspected without a proper technique or acceptance standard, it’s literally tribal knowledge from current workers telling you what the guys before them did. Now if you can even find any of the  digital x rays in storage I wouldn’t believe you.  This is a company I will not work for ever. No care or concern for public safety. Wow."
Boeing,Director of Operations - Chief Pilot - Airline Captain,4,What is the best part of working at the company?Innovation - working with people with a like mindset.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Work schedules (obvious) - deadlines.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Progressive - borderline family.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Standard as at any engineering company.
Boeing,Engineer,2,Management cares more about matrix to the customer rather than doing things right the first time. wasted times creating multoiiple releases of drawings vs. just 1
Boeing,Logistics Analyst II,1,"The current culture- toxicLove what I doBeen doing for 28 years Been with Boeing for 8 1/2Love my job, hate the atmosphere There is no productive management or leadership Boeings slogan- if you see something, say something (unless it’s being done by a manager or leadership, then keep your mouth shut or they’ll retaliate) No room to grow, not allowed unless your friends, as positions are not based on skills but based on loyalty to protect and cover upLacks ethical moral basic human standards "
Boeing,Project Costing and Estimation,5,So far so good I dont have much to say since I just started a little while ago. The training seems to be going well. The people are approachable amd everyone is willing to involve me. 
Boeing,Training Analyst,2,"Duties include onboarding new people to company and prepare expectations for training classes through info sheets, instructors, and culture pamphlets.  Learned during hiring spree onboarding 5000 or more people per week for training courses requires stamina and lots of multitasking.   Hardest part of job?  Boeing's administrative technology is way behind modern times.  To be blunt there is no real use for a floppy disk when there are more efficient means of storage.  Their PC machines were outdated and sluggish without an upgrade in sight.  Management consisted of either retirees or those about to retire.  These people were set in their ways unwilling to budge on more efficient processes and constantly threw their seniority around.  In the interviews they promptly stated they needed to hire a bright and educated college graduate who could prepare them for more efficient processes.  Most enjoyable part of job were the bright new students who continuously came to me for assistance.  It felt great that I could be of service."
Boeing,Field Service Representative,5,Great support team and coworkers. Supporting a very important customer. Good pay and great benefits. Would highly recommend  working for boeing. Lots of opportunities. 
Boeing,Mechanical Assembler,3,"I started working at Boeing on a really bad time for the company. Overall, good people to work with. To bad the company has a bad reputation recently, otherwise I'd still be working there."
Boeing,Software Engineer,4,Great team. And manager. But super tired of trying to carry slackers. Defeats good WLB. Chill but it’s a  dead end career. Benefits are solid. Teams vary from stellar to gross (more of the latter unfortunately). 
Boeing,Quality Engineer,3,"I think I was in the wrong role for what I was capable of doing but if you support production, you will do a lot of spreadsheets and repetitive PowerPoint chart-making tasks. It wasn’t very technical for me so I left. The benefits are the best of all contractors but I didn’t enjoy the work enough to stay. I also had a hard time finding another role in Mesa so you will eventually have to move sites in order to grow"
Boeing,Custodial Worker,4,"They are so kind and appreciative towards staff. Love the managers,they are nice and take time to explain things. They are good listeners and take your concerns seriously."
Boeing,Software Developer,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Very interesting projects with very good work life balance.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Boeing's current situation, there is stresses of layoffs."
Boeing,Aircraft Painter,2,I would strongly recommend not working here.  It is very confusing. This is probably one of the worst career descisions I’ve made.  Pay is good.  You get good healthcare.   Everything else is bad. 
Boeing,Cyber Security Specialist,3,"Generally good pay and benefits, but company is currently more interested  in top dollar return for investors.   Work teams are in need for new people to help take the pressure off in some jobs, but corporate seems to keep denying new hire request."
Boeing,Supply Chain Specialist,4,"Overall, a great company to work for. A good base pay which was topped up with an on call allowance. One of the better companies for benefits, dental and medical which is amazing these days. "
Boeing,Support Equipment Lead,5,Diesel maintenance and blueprint reading is fun! The hardest part is meeting customer demands when the GSE PM schedule is overloaded. I have been under pressure that made me into the technical expert I am today thanks to Boeing.  
Boeing,Change Coordinator,5,"With Boeing being so big there are many different jobs that you can transfer into/apply and interview for. Offers a variety of jobs within the same company. Manufacturing, Engineering, Sales, Quality, etc."
Boeing,Salary Manager,2,Upper leadership is horrible. They don't listen to experienced employees. They are very disconnected from the production floor. They hire new people off the street and give them senior leadership positions. All the way to the top Boeing leadership is horrible.
Boeing,Procurement Agent,4,"This is a great place to launch your career and learn. They are competitive with pay if you are from outside the company but gaining raises within is generally standard inflation rate or less. Some people jump from one aerospace company to another to get pay raises. However, they do have a great benefits package outside of wages. Healthcare, 401k match, continued education and parental leave were top notch. "
Boeing,Shipping and Receiving Clerk,4,Good place to work for what I do. Pay and benefits are better than elsewhere.  Can be fast paced and detail oriented.  But I enjoy that. Over all we work as a team and people help each other when needed. Management is hit or miss. I have had very good but also some not so good. Like most places. But if you are a hard worker and show up for work and do not cause problems for yourself it is a good place to work. If you are young or want to get more education they will help you get it!
Boeing,Mechanic,3,"This place is going downhill fast. Theyre more worried about DEI than having qualified personnel. They make promises they cant keep, they tell customers products are farther along than what they are. They cut corners to meet schedule, they hold down the experienced people and bring in new people with zero knowledge to manage and the union is absolute garbage."
Boeing,Systems Analyst,4,"Boring is a good place to work, depending on management. The work load was fine. Opportunity for advancement is good. There's are a lot of meetings. There are changes to procedure with upper management change. "
Boeing,Production Coordinator B | Production Assistant,4,I was working with multiple higher-ups who both had their own ideas of how I should do my job. I couldn't please both of them and it was very stressful.
Boeing,Supply Base Management Specialist,4,"This is a great company that has great prestige. Management is very flexible while not having a micro management approach. No one steps on toes, which allows every employee to efficiently work in their lane."
Boeing,Field Service Representative,3,Compensation is great along with benefits. Expect to work multiple positions. IF you are working an FMS contract be prepared for minimal to no handover.
Boeing,Factory Service Attendant,4,"it’s okay here, the pay is decent if you put in the work for it. there’s really good benefits here for sure. that’s why a lot of people come here, i know i did "
Boeing,Sr mgr engineering enterprise support ,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The people you worked with  and work on new and exciting aircraft/ space vehicles and unmanned vehiclesWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Challenges with a few individualWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Good environment and everyone is heardWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Something different to work on as a mgr each day
Boeing,Engineer,3,Good health insurance when compared with other companies in seattle. Parking in Everett is painful.  If you can park within 20 min walk to the office considered yourself lucky
Boeing,Layout Specialist,2,The pride in being an employee was no longer there morale is at an all time low management and leads more or less want to try to get you fired versus help you succeed.
Boeing,Composite fabrication specialist,2,Boeing is a good company to work for as far as benefits and compensation goes. The job is not for everyone. My experience at Boeing has been poor. The work is very redundant and soul sucking and I hate coming to work everyday due to the on going shift war that they say they are working on but never gets resolved. In fact all issues you bring up to management pretty much go unresolved. The department I work in is very unstructured and is a mess. Boeing is just such a huge company that you’re just another cog in the wheel so going unnoticed is normal and all of the B.S that comes with working at a huge corporation is very present. 
Boeing,Engineer,3,Yes was good and I like it very much planes are cool and all but engineering is better you spend time with the planes and is great fun and learn much there
Boeing,Fabrication,3,Training was horrible I sat around for 4 months before I was allowed to do anything . Then 2 years later I get laid off. Managment was trash and riddled with playing favorites . 
Boeing,Structure Engineer,4,OKC supports a wide range of different platforms and programs. Promotion process is not available or at least hard to find on intranet sites and very limited feedback from senior leadership/HR of why promotions don't go through. 
Boeing,Project Manager,2,What is the best part of working at the company?I’m trying to think of something but it’s not coming to me What is the most stressful part about working at the company?You mean besides their reputation sucks?

The actual work is a relief."
Boeing,Facilities Analyst,4,Great benefits (immediately vesting 401k with 100% company match up to 10% salary) Poor management and gratitude is not always shown towards those who work hard and go the extra mile.
Boeing,Sealer,3,As an aircraft sealer grade 3 for Boeing it is your responsibility to ensure you seal the component per specification. The area you work in is very tight and narrow and often you can't see where you shoot seal. This leads to stress and frustration and half of the time you cant see what youre doing and have to guess.
Boeing,Shipping and Receiving Clerk,4,Good place to work for what I do. Pay and benefits are better than elsewhere.  Can be fast paced and detail oriented.  But I enjoy that. Over all we work as a team and people help each other when needed. Management is hit or miss. I have had very good but also some not so good. Like most places. But if you are a hard worker and show up for work and do not cause problems for yourself it is a good place to work. If you are young or want to get more education they will help you get it!

Boeing,Supply Chain Intern,4,"The summer internship was very good. Interns were asked to do some projects on their own. Team members supported all the time. National Intern Celebration Week is the best part because few events were planned full week for interns. Factory tours are amazing. Looking at how aeroplanes are getting assembled is one best thing to see. Overall, it's a great experience and one would definitely love it. "
Boeing,Computer Programmer,4,"Working at Boeing was a mixed experience; frequent management changes often resulted in unclear roles and insufficient task allocation for the team. However, the work environment remained pleasant and low-pressure, which contributed positively to the overall experience."
Boeing,Level K,5,"Lots of changing and moving parts, so be sure to be on all P's and Q's and really be able to handle things on the fly as the come and go. Sure, you have a routine day set out, but the people, things you do, and how your day goes really is day-to-day"
Boeing,Manager,5,Great benefits and plenty of paid time off. It’s a bit slow at the Ridley Park sight but there is a future ahead. They treat long time Employees well. 
Boeing,Airline Support Account Manager,5,"Process is well defined for all employees to follow. Many resources are available to hone your existing skills and learn new ones. Managers are generally supportive of your career goals as long as you are on top of driving the goals. Benefits are great, as expected from a large company.People are generally pleasant to work with and are respectful. Good leaders will push for growth and excellence."

Boeing,Supply Chain Specialist – Strike & Surveillance and Dla Execution,5,Hardest part of the job was in minimal cases not meeting the OTD of a customer’s order.  Unexpected delays with suppliers  and manufacturers.  Advancement opportunities are there is some cases but not quite often.

Boeing,Program Integration Manager,1,"One of the worst corporate cultures I've been involved with. They use the term leadership instead of management, but don't actually adhere to the tenants of being leaders instead of managers. Too many inexperienced people promoted too quickly to have any positive effect. STAY AWAY from Charlestion Plant."
Boeing,Analyst,1,What a soul sucking experience. They cared only about profits and would step over anyone to get them. Ethics training each year. What a joke. Their money hungry and put the safety of their customers at risk.

Boeing,Technician,4,"Have patience, because nobody has a fast gear, nor wants to work fast.  I learned that everyone is not a friend. If your not in with the management then your just a body keeping a seat warm.  The hardest part about the job is the waiting and getting questions answered. The best part about the job is the overtime. "
Caterpillar,Accounting,3,"If you can survive the downturns, layoffs, outsourcing (or whatever fancy word they use to help themselves sleep at night), you're good.  Otherwise, good luck."
Caterpillar,Accountant,2,I was in the downtown building. Great pay but no work life balance. Not a great place to work if you have a family. Manager wasn't very supportive but pay was decent. 
Caterpillar,Product Lead,4,"Experiences vary depending on the team you are on. Often given tasks without the guidance or resources to perform them , then questioned why you haven't delivered."
Caterpillar,Cnc repair,1,Absolutely ridiculous to get fired for missing 2 days of work when under drs care and with a drs note. How ridiculous is it that a company doesn’t accept medical notes. They don’t care about their employee’s health 
Caterpillar,Assembler,3,Don’t tell nobody your business and do your work and go home. The management isn’t good they have favorites and very toxic but it’s good money and close to home
Caterpillar,Packer/Picker,4,Everything you do is under a microscope. If you mind your business and do your work that's not a big deal but when you're having a slow day or off day it is tedious.
Caterpillar,Supervisor ,3,Lot of turnover from temp workers.  Hard to be consistent.  Always training because temps and lack of cross training.   Culture of the work force was ok.

Caterpillar,CNC Lathe Setup/Operator,1,I made good money for short time. The employees and staff encourage gossip an hear say to push who ever they want out. I really expected alot better from union involvement and everything else.
Caterpillar,Warehouse Associate,5,"Great schedule, Monday-Thurs 6am-4:30pm. Overtime sometimes but it’s not an option at the moment. Management could be better, there’s a buddy system everywhere you go "
Caterpillar,Senior Quality Engineer,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Nothing, not even the pay.  Poor leadership, constant knee jerk reaction to employees.  Frequent layoffs.  Frequent cuts.  again, a very poorly ran company.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?waiting to be layed off.   Frequent lay offs and shut downs.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?They talk a good game, but never ever walk it.  Just work there for a week or so, and everyone has the same opinion.   What is a typical day like for you at the company?The culture and atmosphere use to be great.  about 15 to 20 years ago.  Now, Cat is like everyone else; do everything as cheaply as possible, and cut training, quality, and people at the first sign of trouble."
Caterpillar,Assembler,4,"Chaotic, lots of favoritism also rules liable to change on a month to month basis. Loved the work but you could be the most productive worker, but when orders slow up they’ll cut anyone, no matter if you carry everybody. "
Caterpillar,Demonstrator,4,"Great team environment, fun place to work and really get to do some awesome things. Pretty good managers to work with with good flexibility as well as good benefits "
Caterpillar,Logistics,3,"Literally no structure you walk around and have to figure out what you’re supposed to be doing. No proper training or effort to help employees to become successful just put you out on the floor to figure it out by yourself, management don’t properly utilize employees the correct way based on experiences"
Caterpillar,Inspector de Control de Calidad,5,"What is the best thing to work in the company? Benefits and salary good work environment and accessible schedules What is the most stressful of working in the company? The work is very heavy and there is no rest, how is the environment and culture ofI work at the company? Well, very friendly and accessible Som How is a typical day for you in the company? With a lot of work under pressure"
Caterpillar,CTL Operator,5,"A Typical day here is very straightforward, Just do the job that you are assigned. I learned about Teamwork. Management is ok.

CAT also offers a Roth IRA which is amazing!"
Caterpillar,Wharehouse Associate,3,"Daily routine is monotonous. Typical day involves driving a reach truck, forklift, or order picker to pick parts in warehouse. You are held to a standard for picks per hour which is unreasonable and forces you to rush more and be unsafe.Poor upper management that is out of touch with fostering pride in work and maintaining good employees.Double standard exists concerning safety. You are held to a high safety standard but the company itself has serious unabated safety issues that reach OSHA violations.Forced overtime is sometimes required but they rarely let you leave early if there is no work in your area.Hardest part of job was trying to work safely while maintaining standard quotas.Most enjoyable part of the job was leaving after end of shift."

Great environment and culture.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Come to work, do your job, and go home."
Caterpillar,Assembler 2,3,You tell management about employees you take advantage when the lead is out and nothing ever gets done. He is a joke. Some departments went slow so they could work overtime.
Caterpillar,Warehouse Associate,1,"This job used to be better. But lately it has become so understaffed and becoming overwhelming. They have a quota system that is brutal to try and hit day In and day out with limited support from management. Draining job, avoid at all costs"
Caterpillar,maquinista,3,In a matter of job opportunities it is bad because you can practically grow if you do not follow some guidelines you are stagnant.In a matter of work environment it is quite good since my coworkers always support some task as well as I supported them.He created that companionship is what highlights in this company.

Caterpillar,Production/Packaging,2,"Easy work at caterpillar but the upper management is a disaster , we had 4 months of no work and being sent home due to management not planning and ordering material . A-6 for 4 months straight . Management here is a joke , they couldn’t manage the frier at McDonald’s . The people whom bust their butt don’t get noticed but the ones that brown nose management seem to get all the bonuses even if they deserve them or not"
Caterpillar,Senior Design Engineer,5,Really Good company and individual will be respected and given more opportunity to grow in your career internally. Receiving recognition for your contribution.

Caterpillar,Logistics warehouse administration support ,5,"Staff highly supportive, accommodating to lengthen contract where needed, inclusive in learning levels, great work mates, flexibility in work days, great place to learn new skills. Only negative is that my job was by contract and was not able to secure a more permanent part time or full time job position. "
Caterpillar,Fabrication Specialist,2,Not a bad stepping stone. If you’re lucky enough to move up it can be a great place to grow but the majority of people that work hard and try to find advancement get turned down time and time again. Pay is mediocre as well as the benefits. Not a place for most to make a fruitful career. Good place for those looking to rack up some work experience for their resume though. 
Caterpillar,Quality Specialist,3,You can make decent money here but upper management tends to set unobtainable goals and then blames employees for not meeting their expectations. Expect alot of overtime 
Caterpillar,Material Handler,4,"It was a good place to work, but plant is closing.  The benefits were good, lots of turnover in upper management though.  Unfortunately not a lot of room for advancement without moving to a larger facility which is out of state."
Caterpillar,Assembly Line Worker,1,Don’t work here they pay u well but treat you like  horrible and they don’t care about the families all they care about is production some things not worth the money your life is worth more
Caterpillar,Mechanical Assembler II,3,"Not a bad job. Management is decent. Work is load hard at times, but just do your best and you will be fine. PTO is exceptional though, plus they offer really low price health coverage, and 401k. "

Caterpillar,Product Manager,5,"Very supportive management team, and intelligent, great and friendly people to work with. Hybrid way of working promoting diversity and work life balance"
Caterpillar,Material Handler/Forklift Operator,1,Absolutely toxic work environment filled with law breakers allowed to make everyone uncomfortable there worst warehouse experience of my entire life. They enjoy wiping feces on bathroom walls as well. Then tru inviting highschoolers to tour
Caterpillar,Fabrication,3,Caterpillar is a negative experience working in a hot factory were doing the minimum might just make you the best you can be in any concurrent situation 
Caterpillar,Machinist,5,"Some of my best working life, loved the job, loved the people really just couldn’t say anything better about this place, same as anywhere I’m sure, improvement can be made in areas but as far as I’m concerned they were always working on any improvements "
Caterpillar,Engineer,4,"Really enjoy the people I work with, the product is great and most of the projects are fun.A lot of opportunities to move around and get different experiences"
Caterpillar,Warehouse Associate,5,"Great job for someone looking for something long term. They offer all kinds of bonuses, vacation time, and all management is well trained. Both inbound/outbound have heavy tiring jobs but you get plenty of breaks and management offers snacks. Don’t recommend to someone who wants an easy job. Job is hard and you will learn a lot. I was highly experienced before coming in and there are so many parts in all shapes in sizes that will test your skills."
Caterpillar,Wire Technician,3,"I'll start with the positives: it's the perfect company for career advancement. Longterm, you can make CAT your final pick for the kind of company you can retire from. There's lots of opportunities to pursue different fields of work to expand your career. It's really a good company. But, now for the negative part: none of positives matters because you can't have any of those chances if you're not hired on. You start as a temp, as everybody else. And it is a very tedious process that takes a lot of time and effort to get selected. And to make matters worse, they seem to only have open slots once in a while. And by open slots, I mean they have just ONE or TWO slots open for roughly 15+ plus applicants; every so many months. So it's very competitive. And you're not going up against others who take the job lightly. Then, if you're not selected, you gotta wait another few months or so for another slot for open. Rinse and repeat, until you are selected. It's a very long process. It takes a ton of patience and hard work to sit and wait. So in turn, this has a bad impact on work culture environment. Since everybody is competing against each other for such an important opportunity, people end up ""gate keeping"" their knowledge and skills. In my time working for Caterpillar, I had to constantly ask questions on how to do my job, with it being a repetitive scenario where I would get 5 different answers for 1 simple questions. And somehow it usually ends up wrong. The drawings they give you are sometimes wrong. You could follow the instructions to a T, and somehow there would be so many - more..."
Caterpillar,Test Technician,5,"Awesome place to work, I love it. Work home life balance is great. 3 day weekends every other weekend.  Boss is great, I learned a lot here. Would highly reccomend"
Caterpillar,Logistic,5,"The best, the best pay and everything I loved it so much I will go back any day I loved the job and the pay I lasted there for a very long time best job ever"
Caterpillar,Production Trainer,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Caterpillar has been good to me, you get out of it what you put into it. I started as an assembler 6 years ago and now I’m a production trainer. I will be a C AT employee for as long as they’ll have me! What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Hearing all the negative talk on the floor from the workers who don’t want to do what they need to do, complaining instead of improving. It’s getting better though. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?We are improving daily with more communication and training. People is our number one concern and our plant manager definitely loves his people. Most of the negative comes from people who lack work ethic, commitment, or the understanding of responsibility.. we are seeing less and less of that thankfully. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Like I have this large family that I get to see everyday. I love going to work, it’s my happy place."
Caterpillar,Accounting,3,"If you can survive the downturns, layoffs, outsourcing (or whatever fancy word they use to help themselves sleep at night), you're good.  Otherwise, good luck."

Caterpillar,EHS Associate,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?I had an excellent head of health and safety as line managerWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with awkward and moribund workforceWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Shop floor is dirty, dark and miserable the office area is retro 80s not comfortable. The  management are changing the culture but it is deep rooted, hidebound and overwhelmingly negative depressing place to work.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Confrontational dealing with belligerent workers who are as thick as mince"
Caterpillar,Assembly Operator,4,"decent pay, excellent working hours. Management is very supportive Unfortunately as an agency  worker you need to wait a couple of years for a contract"
Caterpillar,Receptionist,5,Great place to work. Supportive management. I enjoy coming to work everyday. Communication is key and everyone works well together. The pay is acceptable. 
Caterpillar,EHS Professional,4,You'll have plenty of opportunities to touch parts of the business that interest you but they'll ask a lot of you in turn. Management is supportive and will give you resources but you'll need to learn to say no.
Caterpillar,material handler,1,What is the best part of working at the company?a pay check.. managment dont care about youWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?finding parts they dont make anymore... MANAGMENTWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?terrible..  they have alot of out sourced workers and no one gets alongWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?terribly hot...too many micro-managers
Caterpillar,Technician,5,First plant job and learned alot of skills that got me where i am today. Enjoyed learning the various operations and working with other team members. 
Caterpillar,Senior Order Analyst,5,"Cheerful, friendly environment at work. Most of my experience in technology, customer service, typing, MS Office, Etc comes from working at Caterpillar. Management is great, different backgrounds, and that they give women opportunities that they won't be given in other similar work places. I enjoyed working there, mainly because of the great envi, and people. "
Caterpillar,Manager ,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Big name brand. Benefits. Looks good on a resume. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Apathetic culture, HR afraid to terminate, site leader in role too long & universally loathed. Disengaged leadership more focused on their own work life balance than being leaders. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Disengaged and apathetic. Cliques. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Pass down session, start up, supporting my team until shift end. Writing up shift notes."
Caterpillar,Welder 1,3,During recruitment I was told that over time was voluntary and very sporadic.  After being hired was told OT was mandatory and was almost every Saturday. 
Caterpillar,Project Manager,4,"Caterpillar can be a great place for growth and opportunity. However, there can be alot of politicking and who you know can matter than what you do. Some of its culture is stuck in the past because of its history but overall its a solid place to have a career."
Caterpillar,Warehouse Associate,1,Daily work assignments are not distributed fairly among workers. Some positions on the assembly line will require hands on builds for every piece of equipment that comes down the conveyor belt while other positions only require every other piece of equipment to build. Depending on the Zone you're assigned to some workers work nonstop while others can take breaks in between builds. And will not come over to help you.
Caterpillar,Manufacturing Engineer,4,"I have worked at other plants for caterpillar and loved it. They had great culture and managers cared for their employees. Unfortunately, this plant doesn't follow any of those standards. Upper management has no clue how to do their jobs or make a factory more efficient. They constantly pass blame. Different departments fight with one another and never work together to solve issues. Work-life balance is not valued. I have seen management get upset with employees for trying to put in bereavement and many other things. The plant is in such a poor space financially, they will not seek to promote you or advance you anything beyond the bottom line. I would not be surprised if Caterpillar shut this plant down in the near future. "
Caterpillar,Material specialist,1,"There are a certain percentage of people that have attained a  hegemony within this company. They never lose their jobs no matter how many mistakes they make, yet everyone else eventually gets discharged. Nepotism and Fraternity favoritism runs the show behind the scenes. Many people are related to each other regardless of company policy that states otherwise. The UAW pushes an us versus them vibe but it's just Them.  Distant cousins in the UAW related to the Corporate managers and office employees. The UAW deducts 2.5 hours of wages to work there.  No strike in over 30 years. All those dues collected makes interest money and goes to their causes, not yours. They provide zero protection against job loss, it goes to an arbitrary meeting and they will not help you. Management works with stewards to provide  controlled confrontations to make you think you need to belong to a company sponsored and controlled union. They have a crew in every facility that will sabotage your work. They say you made mistakes but cannot prove it, then you are discharged. "
Caterpillar,Manager,4,"Not a bad company at all, good benefits and treated well. A few bad apples as with any company but overall was a great experience. Only bad thing was the decline of mining at the time."
Caterpillar,Hose Fabricator,2,What is the best part of working at the company?They had a good benefits package.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management. I had the worst manager I've ever had.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The hydraulic hose plant is very woke
Caterpillar,Warehouse Associate/Forklift Operator,2,"Management favors people from Seguin, they can come in late or miss more often.   If you're from San Antonio you will be heavily watched for any mistakes. "

Pfizer,Scientist,4,Supportive and fun company to work for.  Great team and really do there best to support you in your career growth and journey by offering training and secondments
Pfizer,Maintenance Technician,4,Fairly demanding work schedule and understaffed but everyone is.  Great people good benefits and good pay.  I would return and work there again if the right fit came along
Pfizer,Associate,5,Great place to work with a work life balance. Work hours 7:00am -3:30pm for my shift and management is so understanding if any help is needed to balance work and life. 
Pfizer,Consulente commerciale,2,"Stimulating work environment, with the strengths and weaknesses of a large company.Company of the pharmaceutical sector, with great experience also in other fields."
Pfizer,Professional Service Representative,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Best company I had ever worked with, Pfizer value their employees by facilitating them through every possible way.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?Attending online meetings and online trainings."
Pfizer,Project Manager,5,Working at Pfizer was one exciting and the people were highly educated.  Expectations therefore to think through a problem were high.  But the company was open to the best process and solution.
Pfizer,Analyst,3,I worked terrible hours for terrible pay in new york. 50k pre tax in manhattan is a joke. My coworkers were all mean to me and there was no upward mobility. Do not work for them.
Pfizer,Medical Affairs ,4,Great culture and compensation is one of the highest in the industry. Managers are competent and supportive and don’t micromanage. Colleagues are extremely professional
Pfizer,Associate Scientist – Clinical Assay Development,1,A typical day at work is busy but manageable. I learned a lot about time management and teamwork. Management is very non supportive and non approachable. The workplace culture is toxic a. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult managers. 
Pfizer,Asesor Médico,3,"The company presumes a lot that they are pro balance/ work balance and it is not so, they proclaim that employees are the most important and not."
Pfizer,Quimico Analista,4,"Your growth and plant opportunities depend on your personal relationships.The better you are in your work, the more they give you and even do the others"
Pfizer,Associate Scientist,4,"Great pay, amazing benefits, opportunity to work on life changing drugs. Management had some kinks to workout. Higher level managers unaware of things happening on the ground level in the labs, leads to chaos"
Pfizer,Senior Production Supervisor,4,Had a great experience working at the Pfizer R2 facility. Job was intense and required dedicated attention to detail. Good support structure and great co-workers. Manpower shortages and constant need for qualified employees and the stress that that created on supervisors was the major downside of the job.   
Pfizer,Scientist I,1,"This company lives up to its cutthroat reputation. Terrible experience, awful colleagues. I would not return for any amount of money in the world.  Do not plan to stay. "
Pfizer,TBM,4,OkIt is a good company. Now a days they are holding all operations and merging all the divisions. Their products are good . But mostly they are launching me too brands 
Lockheed Martin,Publications Writer/Editor Sr,5,"The pace of work in the publications department was varied: if a proposal was in process, pace was fast and furious to meet deadlines. Same applied to working the newsletter: serious deadlines. Otherwise, the pace was comfortable and there was always a great deal of cooperation among employees/management, both within the department and without. The feeling of pride in the completion of your duties for this company was always palpable. The most enjoyable part of the job for me personally came when the newsletter was finalized, printed and distributed among employees. Generally, there was good feedback from management and staff within the division. Satisfaction. "
Lockheed Martin,System Safety Engineer,4,"The pros and cons are much like you’d expect from a large company.Leadership and company messaging is generally good, except where it isn’t.Company strategy is good, and tools and processes are good if they’re actually funded, used and implemented. In some spots they’re not.Just like many companies in industry, LM is working through a digital transformation. In the meantime, new and different tools are pushed through rather hastily. The result is a somewhat fragile, fragmented implementation.Lockheed Martin is so large that it has great programs and opportunities for those chosen. Where leadership does not do a good job of supporting employees, it can also be pretty bad.Each LM business and location has its own culture, often tying back to the organization heritage contractor (for example - GD, Unisys, Lockheed, IBM, Vought systems)."
Lockheed Martin,General Flightline Mechanic,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Work was steady, management wasn't all over us, ans the pay was a bit above averageWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with conflicting directionsWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Relaxed environment and easy to do daily"
Lockheed Martin,MQ-9 Maintenance Engineer (Deployed),5,"Lockheed Martin is a well respected and great pls r to work, especially as a veteran. I have had nothing but positive experiences with management and operations."
Lockheed Martin,Industrial Engineer,4,Great place to work and flexible schedule. You see many people that have been with the company their whole career which says a lot. Workload can be stressful at times. 
Lockheed Martin,Manufacturing Engineer,5,"The people are amazing to work with. Everyone on my team helps each other out and are team players. There is a lot ok knowledgeable people. I really enjoy the culture, is very diverse and inclusive.  Management encourage work/life balance.  "
Lockheed Martin,Logistics Engineer,2,"Leadership clearly establishes favorites, which tend to be the individuals that either don't know their jobs or aren't willing to contribute. Poor project planning and leadership is unwilling to consider recommendations despite experience."
Lockheed Martin,Senior Member of Engineering Staff (Software Engineer),1,"This company does not care about you, it is a massive corporation, their managers will pretend to be nice and literally bully you in front of everyone to make a point. I’ve seen it happen multiple times to other employees. And it is happens to me. Do not work here. They will stifle your creativity and your drive. They will alienate you and push you out if you aren’t a willing punching bag. "
Lockheed Martin,F16 APG,5,This is genuinely the best job I’ve ever worked. My management is awesome. My coworkers are awesome. The hours aren’t terrible and there’s so much room to grow. You can have zero experience and they’ll give you everything you need to succeed as long as you’re willing to try.
Lockheed Martin,Senior Project Manager,4,"Good benefits. Great flexibility.  Good mobility.There's a lot of different departments, so if you ever feel stuck you can move around.  Company fosters growth. "
Lockheed Martin,"Alabaster, AL",3,Great place to work understanding of the marketplace characteristics of a larger company . People were nice and approachable mostly happy overall . Good 
Lockheed Martin,Fuel Cell Technician,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?I learned how to do all fuel work on P-3 and C-130 aircraftsWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not feeling appreciated and not being able  to move up bexause of myself being to honest and to real for most people, plus there was somewhat of a race barrier between white people and everybody else.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Some people work hard but most just do enough to get by.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Crawling inside of fuel tanks to fix leaks and replace plumbing. Also pressure testing fuel tanks."
Lockheed Martin,Buyer,3,Changing requirements makes skill development and feeling like you are good at what you do seem impossible. Great flexible schedule and opportunity for growth 
Lockheed Martin,Crane Operator,5,The facility is top notch and a very cool place to work at. Great company to work for. Benefits are amazing as well as the pay. The facility has everything you need to make it through a day of work. 
Lockheed Martin,Electronics Technician,3,"Friendly leadership, we can never get anything done though.  Never have parts, so they shift schedules and priorities to remain Green. Resulting no OT"
Lockheed Martin,Machinist,2,Useless and clueless management with zero knowledge of what workers do. Unionized so there is a lot of back biting and politics. Politics here is the heaviest I’ve ever ever experience in any company.
Lockheed Martin,Electronics Assembly,5,"I loved working at LM. If I didn't have to move I'd still be there. I feel like they give every opportunity for their employees to grow professionally. Not the best starting pay for hourly, but you get good, multiple raises each year. The people are friendly and it feels like a very safe place to work with all of the security in place. Cons:Most places you can park your car, before going through the gate to your job, are not close. The fastest walk you'd have to your job would be about 5-6 minutes. There are no nice, covered, outside areas to enjoy breaks. The table they have are under a tree and bugs drop onto you constantly.  There are no windows in the facility,  so not being able to go outside comfortably was a downside for me."
Lockheed Martin,Operations Manager,3,"They need better senior leaders that understand the workers do a lot to meet their goals, and when you creatw unrealistic timelines, it can put extra pressure on the employees. "
Lockheed Martin,Aerospace TIG Welder,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?We are one Big family here at Lockheed Martin What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Sometime it would be 10 hour daysWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Awesome work place and Safety What is a typical day like for you at the company?Focus quality being at the top of your game, and of course safety"
Lockheed Martin,Engineering Aide,4,"LM is in general, a decent place to work. However there are too many folks convinced of their own importance and collecting a paycheck. Certain functions need to be pushed back to the functional engineering groups instead of being thrown over a wall. Rather inflexible even when faced with better ideas. "
Lockheed Martin,Senior QA Analyst,5,Overall a great company to work for. Local management is very approachable and allows autonomy to make/implement decisions over your respective area. The biggest downside is there are not a lot of growth opportunities unless you are willing to move. Benefits are average for the industry but PTO will vary depending on which business area you are part of. 
Lockheed Martin,Publications Writer/Editor Sr,5,"The pace of work in the publications department was varied: if a proposal was in process, pace was fast and furious to meet deadlines.

Lockheed Martin,Sr. Project Manager ,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Exposure to very unique products and projects, and occasionally brilliant people.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?A lot of people are placed in positions of power due to longevity or other characteristics such as gender, but the person is NOT qualified.  While there, I saw several non-qualified managers be threatened by subordinate employees and therefore treat the employee rather poorly. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Lockheed's office buildings are more run down than you would expect.  I was in many of Lockheed's facilities and they were typically very poorly maintained. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Typically fast-paced, and sometimes with significant travel.  A lot of ""reporting out""."
Lockheed Martin,Cyber software engineer,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Flexible hours and being able to work from home sometimes.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Abundance of meetings on a daily basis with the expectancy of getting the majority of your work load done the same day. Micromanaging alsoWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very diverse culture's and work environment safeWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Tons of meetings, stand-ups and busy work."
Lockheed Martin,Inspector-Assembly A,5,"a company that pays well, nice benefits, strong union all in a clean climate controlled work place. Supplying our military with some of the most advanced weapons to keep the USA FREE  "
Lockheed Martin,Manufacturing Planner & Scheduler,4,When I worked for Lockheed it was a great place to work if you’re from the area. People were friendly but the work culture felt very local and unfortunately I was not from there. I felt out of place at times and in order to grow I had to transfer to a different location. People who worked there a really long time seem to get away with things that newer younger people could not. Everything was based on seniority. I enjoyed my statement of work I got joy out of what I was doing and made long lasting friendships with some of my co-workers while I was working there.
Lockheed Martin,Sheet Metal Mechanic,1,The pay and benefits are good other than that look elsewhere terrible management very little training provided but expectations very high wouldn’t recommend 
Lockheed Martin,Senior Network Engineer,5,"Lockheed Martin is renowned for offering robust career growth opportunities, competitive pay, and a flexible schedule. Employees appreciate the company's commitment to professional development, with access to various training programs, mentorship, and advancement opportunities. The competitive compensation packages are complemented by comprehensive benefits, making Lockheed Martin an attractive employer in the aerospace and defense sector. Many employees also value the flexible work arrangements, which help balance professional and personal life, enhancing overall job satisfaction. This combination of career advancement, attractive pay, and work flexibility makes Lockheed Martin a compelling choice for professionals seeking growth and stability in a supportive work environment."
Lockheed Martin,Operations Associate,2,No clear vision and constantly changing direction. Expectation of long hours to make up for management failures. Incredible scope creep as management panders to the customer trying to modify the contract every few months.
Lockheed Martin,IT Intern,5,"Really chill workers especially if you work remote. Hours are also manageable and you have the flexibility to work whenever you want as long as you do 40 hours each week. Overall, a great job even if management can be a bit messy at times."
Lockheed Martin,Structural Mechanic,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?They have a very flexible work schedule, you have the options of working 4/10's either Monday - Thursday or Tuesday - Friday. If you want to work 5/8's you have the options of 6am-2:30pm, 7am-3:30pm or 8am-4:30pm. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Really bad leadership and every department has the ""good ole boy"" system. So even if you are a nonproductive employee, if you are buddies with the right bosses then your job is safe. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's really good work experience for the most part and the company provides all the tools. If you can just put your head down and concentrate on work it's not bad. And you get to work on some cool military aircraft. But the huge caveat that stands in the way of this being a really good place to work, is the people. Most of the mechanics and electricians are former military and some of them have a hard time getting the military mentality out of their head. The 80/20 rule is very much a thing there, meaning 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people. I worked there for over 8 years and that has to be the largest gathering on conspiracy theorist I have ever encountered. There is joking and trying to have fun, but someone always has to bring their weird religious or political views into the conversation and ruin it. If by some chance you can just focus on the job and not get sucked into all the weirdness of the employees, then you will be just fine.What is a typical day like for you at the company?They work on - more..."
Lockheed Martin,Administrative Support Senior Specialist,5,I worked here for over 8 years & loved being apart of such a great company. Managers valued members of their team & coworkers were a joy to work with.

Lockheed Martin,Intern,5,"Everyone on the team is chill and understanding. All you have to do is put the hours in and everyone will be fine with you. If you put in all your hours by Thursday, you can have Friday off."
Lockheed Martin,Software Engineer,4,"Good place to work to start off career.  Depending on the program, work-life balance can be good. A lot of resources for learning new skills. As always, the team/manager you are with makes a big difference"

Lockheed Martin,Inventory Associate,5,"Very cool work environment, amazing coworkers, and great connections to be made on base. Supervisors/management are all cool and very understanding on things."
Lockheed Martin,Supply Technician,5,"Every company has their flaws. This one is it lets the lazy people keep their jobs while the hard workers work hard. Pay is great, Flex Time, great 401k match"
Lockheed Martin,Mechanical engineer 1&2,3,"During my time at Lockheed Martin, I experienced a range of positives and negatives. The company offers good benefits and a flexible work schedule, which were definite perks. The health insurance offerings were reasonably priced with an HSA, comparable to other Fortune 500 companies. However, the gym reimbursement was below average and was completely removed in 2024, although some facilities did have small on-site gyms.As a mechanical engineer, my experience was less than stellar. The work primarily involved support equipment, which was mostly administrative and involved waiting for customer approvals on minor changes. Opportunities for innovation were rare, and significant projects that could develop my skills as an engineer were scarce. I only had the chance to work on a truly challenging and exciting spaceflight equipment project for one year out of six. Despite numerous attempts to find new projects or teams, I faced constant barriers and budget cuts.Promotions were another sore point. Every year brought new excuses for why a promotion couldn't happen, from budget cuts to administrative freezes. Managers had the authority to create openings, but many did not support their employees adequately. While the pay was competitive, it varied by state, with discrepancies such as an 8% economic relief bonus in Colorado that was not extended to Florida, despite similar cost of living increases.In summary, while Lockheed Martin offers some solid benefits and competitive pay in certain areas, the opportunities for career development and promotions, particularly for mechanical engineers, - more..."

Management changes.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Average. Seniority runs everything.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Average. Nothing extravagant or spectacular.
Lockheed Martin,General Flight Mechanic,3,Lockheed Marthin hire anyone to meet the government standers and there are people who have the experience getting paid the same as young people who never hold a drill. They don't see skill they see young people to grow with a new program even if they have no clue what is composite or drill or LO. This is way good programs go down due to the company don't want to pay the people who been in Aviation. 
Lockheed Martin,Systems Engineer,5,"Lockheed Martin is a dynamic and innovative workplace that offers employees the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies and impactful projects. The collaborative environment at Lockheed Martin fosters teamwork and creativity, encouraging employees to bring their unique perspectives to the table. "
Lockheed Martin,Engineering Aide Specialist & Vibration Tech Lead,2,"It's all about who curries favor with management, and who is so bad at their job that a promotion will actually increase productivity. As a result, cliques and coupes are the name of the game. Anyone who is good enough and deserving needs to have a lot of friends to earn their rightful spot, and it's always just underneath someone who isn't so they can offset the idiocrasy. Boeing won't be the only shysters in the news cycle before too long with this kind of management culture."
Lockheed Martin,Admistrative Assistant,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Pays well. Good benefits for all employees.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Many of the upper managers are two-faced. They will listen to your problems and allow you to vent to them only to use against you or repeat to others. Managers can rarely be trusted here.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Polite but there is favoritism.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Productive most of the time. Not a heavy workload
Lockheed Martin,Systems Engineering Manager,4,"Lockheed Martin is as good as it gets when it comes to large corporations. Their benefits are respectable, pay is respectable, and executive leadership seems to be just good enough to not alienate everyone. You could absolutely do worse."
Lockheed Martin,Senior Procurement Analyst  & Manager,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Good Ethics program and company has zero tolerance for harassment and unethical behavior and enforces that program.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Company constantly involved in cost reduction and manpower planning initiatives which usually equates to layoffs.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It literally depends on where you work and your managers approach, some are micro-managers which sucks and some actually empower their employees, which is great.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Professional environment with tight deadlines and budgets."
Lockheed Martin,Systems Engineer,5,Good environment.  Friendly co-workers.   Challenging work.   Lots of training opportunities.   Career felt safe given amount of variety of work across organization.
Lockheed Martin,Engineering Technician V,5,"I really enjoy being able to experiment with systems to develop test stations and this job gives me that opportunity. Good Pay and benefits especially the Military Reserve affiliation compensation. I've never seen a company work with Veterans and Reserve members quite like Lockheed Martin. The only problem is for the specific ET5 position, pay is determined from national wage determinations and they haven't been considered for a wage increase in some time. That's not really Lockheed's fault since it's a Department of Labor determination. Overall great company"
Lockheed Martin,Software Engineer Intern,4,"Interned on a team working on internal software. Coworkers were friendly, helpful and intelligent, wlb was great, working hours flexible as long as you are on during ""core hours"", you can complete the rest of your 40 hours whenever you want. Would have returned if pay was better."
Lockheed Martin,Circuit Card Design Engineer Senior,4,Excellent Opportunities for growth. Great work/life balance. Good corporate culture. Has an unfortunate tendency to hire anyone with a pulse so you can end up with teammates who are dead weight. Will allow you to move programs if you are unhappy with your current role.
Lockheed Martin,Senior AI Engineer,3,"Overall a decent place to work. It can definitely vary by BA and team; however, most teams do not push the members too hard. There can definitely be people that slack a bit and others who skirt by doing barely any work as a ""lead"". Management is decent, although again that can very by BA. Overall not exceptional, but not bad in the slightest. The PTO, vacation days, and 4/10 work schedule is definitely nice."
Lockheed Martin,Software Engineer,4,Really good WLB and CultureManagers are really supportive and try their best to help you progress in your career.Pay is not the best and that is the tradeoff for a better WLB.
Lockheed Martin,Manufacturing Supervisor,4,Great benefits and work/life balance. Non-represented workforce works a 4/40 week. Three day weekends every week is fantastic. Upper management overall is good. Even on my worst day I never felt like I didn’t have support. 
Lockheed Martin,Sr. Software Engineer,4,"The role you are brought in at, will be the role you will stay at unless you can change programs and negotiate a higher position.  For me, I really should have been brought in as a level 4, but was only offered a level 3 position.  After several great things and empty promises for promotion I just got the promotion by moving to a different company."
Lockheed Martin,Customer Service Representative,4,"It was an overall good experience. You’ll never be bored as the phone calls were endless at the time I was there.  Also enjoyed being around a diverse group of people, which included management. "

Lockheed Martin,Sr. Staff Engineer,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The perceived value that your time here will add to your resume.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Constantly missing deadlines and not achieving mission objectives. The constant negative reviews in the media will ensure you never disclose what program you are on. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Excessively Woke. Lazy, Unsuccessful with Management Politics that run very deep.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Very Easy and Laid back with little expectations."

Lockheed Martin,Intern,5,Easy work but not much to do. Slower work pace but understandable due to the red tape. Despite being swe for IT I'm not doing much coding. Sometimes have to ask for more work so that I keep busy.
Lockheed Martin,Project Coordinator,5,LM was one of the best places I've worked. they respected my and my contributions and we had a common mission which is always a great reason to get out of bed and head to work!
Lockheed Martin,Manufacturing Engineer,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The Brand name and association with the world’s largest defense contractor.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Over educated younger people wanting to climb the corporate ladder.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?No training for systems or the worst CAD/CAM software, CREO.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Glad to be on the way home and one day closer to the weekend."
Lockheed Martin,Engineering Aide Spec,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The benefits but the price you pay by being overworked and under appreciated is not worth a few nice benefits. I was shifted to 4 different jobs in 2 years. Training is poor at best. Expectations are unreasonable and unattainable. Salaried employees are expected to work 5 to 10 hours extra every week. They are cutting corners to meet deadlines. Stress level is off the charts. They have a hiring freeze even though they are still posting jobs. I was very disappointed. Wish they had not hired me. Miserable experience. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?High expectations, micro-managers, extra hours mandatory for salaried employees, no trainingWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful, they prefer younger employees. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Managers criticize employees. Asks what you’re working on. Very noisy workplace. Hard to focus."
Lockheed Martin,Aircraft Maintenance Technician,4,"Decent pay, good people. Benefits could have been better, but a lot of company’s now only provide a deductible plan which can be hard on families with existing medical conditions having to pay large out of pocket costs before having decent coverage."
Lockheed Martin,Field Sales Support Systems Engineer,5,"Great place to work, &  great work culture. Management is ok. Small group which allows lots of interaction with everyone. Decent work life balance and pay, could improve."
Lockheed Martin,Systems Engineer,4,The type of work is fun and I enjoy interactions with my team. It’s very flexible in terms of work structure. The biggest complaint is how the other companies pay more for similar positions.
Lockheed Martin,Software Engineer,5,This is a great place to start a career. Good management and incremental increase in wages and job titles. They have great benefits and development programs. 
Lockheed Martin,Software Engineer,2,"Unless you know someone forget about getting hired internally.The pay is way too low but it does have a good WLB. Management is out of touch and the company itself is very anti-remote work despite the fact that 97% of the work of a software engineer here can be done at home, including programs with security clearances (source: me)There are at least 2 different pay bands for software engineers: if you switch to a program that has a lower pay band, your already lower than market value base salary will be garnished and you will be stuck in that pay band essentially  until you get promoted. "
Lockheed Martin,"Blackstone, VA",3,"Being able to work independently was a plus. One thing I learned at least at the blackstone va location was that the leadership was terrible.  They all act like they were supportive of you, and talked bad about you behind your back amongst each other and to upper management.  When you speak your mind it's frowned upon but yet they act like it's ok if they do so.  You have the honest system as I call it where you do your own time and submit it yourself but yet management goes by what others ""say"" your time is with no verification.  Close knit buddy system. One employee arrived late to work everyday,failed a drug test and still works there. So good luck!"
Lockheed Martin,Capture Manager,3,Mid-level managers are generally good to their employees.   Director level becomes cut throat (like most defense companies).  Lockheed does its reshuffling routine and lays-off people every few years- even if it's doing well.   
Lockheed Martin,Manager,4,"Good benefits, good pay, good vacation, good sick leave, technical work inside of air conditioned facilities. Possible rotation to other projects and programs."
Lockheed Martin,Associate,5,Great culture and upward mobility. Would recommend this to anyone who is interested in IT engineering for the rest of their life. Benefits are competitive!
Lockheed Martin,Quality Engineer Associate,4,"Decent pay, really cool job. However, there are too many people in management yet little to no support. Benefits are awful.

Intel Corporation,Process Engineer,1,"New Mexico is already the lowest paying Intel site but they also have the fewest opportunities for job advancement. Ridiculous amounts of bureaucracy prevents you from doing your job and the tools and processes are so incredibly outdated that you end up spending an extra 30-40 hours each week you are on call to manually run manufacturing lines. Upper management here is also a joke and believes that engineers should be present everywhere at once, they even require engineers to have meetings in the fab because they are so dumb."

Intel Corporation,Process Engineer,3,"Intel prior to 2019 used to be good.  Post 2019 - 2023, were met with tons of lay-offs and shortage of engineers and technicians.  Headcounts were reduced to barebone with Engineers having to work week / weekly on-calls 24/7.  We were barely getting enough sleep.  On-calls were always  detrimental and getting calls from 12 am - 6 am from the night shift to contain equipment or produciton issues.  You can never go back to sleep and sometime up 14- 24 hours because of so many calls and sleep interruption.  Especially if you have to work on the weekends, you basically are working 7 days a week 12 - 18 hours a day.  You would be lucky to get 10 if everything is running smooth.The only good perks, or was, about Intel is the pay, benefits, and holidays, and freebies but now that is all gone.

It is a learning issue; Intel doesn’t learn from their mistakes.  It tries but after each voluntary/involuntary layoffs or reorg people have forgotten and they make the same mistakes.

You own your own training.Training is OJT, almost exclusively.Technician finds he has a narrow range of skills despite years in the job as the company is happy for you to stay doing the same job year in and year out.Blame culture, although not as bad, still exists.Lots of talk of inclusion, but very little about the snobbery shown by some engineers towards technicians.Risk-averse and overtly safety-conscious culture stifles creativity.How you progress in the company all down to your relationship with your direct manager.A feeling of disconnectedness from the decision-makers due to the sheer size of the workforce and layers of middle management.

Compensation is good but expectations are all over the place.

Intel Corporation,Process Engineer,1,"Before COVID, this was a dream job.  After COVID, business got worse, and so did working conditions.  Bonuses and incentives were slowly stripped away as consequences of bad decisions made by upper leadership many years ago took effect.  Stock is now worth 1/3 of what it once was.  Headcount has been cut to around 1/3 of what it once was, while responsibilities have been unrealistically tripled.  Disrespect and dignity went out the door years ago.  Work-life balance is balanced at all work and what is left over you can have for your life.  The machines are 20+ years old, and you're expected to keep them running with parts that are no longer made and you have to ask permission to order.  If there is an intermittent issue with one of your machines, say goodbye to any 3 day weekends or holidays.  You will be working all hours of the night if that happens.You're also expected to sit through 4 hours plus of meetings every day and somehow expected to repair your machine at the same time.It's not worth your mental health.

The projects I was involved in were complex and pushed the boundaries of current technology, which kept me engaged and motivated.Intel's commitment to work-life balance was also noteworthy. Despite the demanding nature of the work, the company offered flexible working hours and generous time-off policies. The on-site facilities, including gyms and cafeterias, were excellent and contributed to a positive work environment.However, like any large corporation, Intel had its challenges. The size of the organization sometimes led to bureaucratic processes that could slow down decision-making. Additionally, the fast-paced nature of the tech industry meant that there was constant pressure to deliver results quickly.Overall, my time at Intel was invaluable for my professional growth.

Intel Corporation,Technical Program Manager,1,"During my time at Intel, I observed significant leadership challenges that hindered the company’s ability to stay competitive. Leadership often appeared out of touch with market trends, particularly in emerging technologies like AI, leading to missed opportunities and a loss of market share, notably to competitors like AMD.At a more immediate level, my experience with management was frustrating due to inconsistent communication and a tendency towards micromanagement. This created a work environment where clarity and trust were often lacking, making it difficult to be effective in my role.Given these issues, it's not surprising that Intel is currently facing significant struggles. While I hope the company can turn things around, I have serious concerns about its future trajectory. I would advise potential employees to carefully consider whether the current environment aligns with their career goals."

Intel Corporation,Software Engineer,5,"As a testament to the adage that success lies not just in what you do, but how you do it, Intel shines brightly as a paragon of excellence in the tech industry. Stepping into the realm of software development, one is often inundated with tales of rigorous schedules, cutthroat competition, and a relentless pursuit of profit. However, within the hallowed halls of Intel, a different narrative unfolds – one steeped in a culture of camaraderie, innovation, and unwavering commitment to work-life balance.At the heart of Intel's success story is its unique and nurturing culture. From the moment one joins the team, they are enveloped in an atmosphere that fosters collaboration, creativity, and inclusivity. Unlike many companies where hierarchy stifles innovation, here, every voice is not only heard but valued. This culture of openness encourages employees to share ideas fearlessly, leading to the birth of groundbreaking innovations and solutions.One of the most remarkable aspects of Intel is its dedication to work-life balance (WLB). In an industry notorious for its long hours and high-pressure environments, Intel stands out as a beacon of sanity.

Intel Corporation,Manufacturing Technician,1,"Cost of living pay increase was 10$ per month. They already pay 10-15$ less hourly than industry average.  Prepare to be severely undervalued. They use middle management as a stepping stone role so you will have a new manager every 6 months and that stops you from promoting.  The manager will micromanage you but has no clue what your job actually is,  meaning , the person who rates your performance is rating you on  tasks they do not understand. Work is repetitive and you are treated like cattle. Lay offs approximately every 3-5 years. However, there are lots of restaurants in the cafeteria and a dentists, vision center, and massage therapist. If you are content at entry level and getting very good at your job without pay increase, this is the place for you. There’s also pto that can be taken in 2 hrs or less without notice and don’t have to give a reason. "

Employees are constantly being assessed and graded, you will often have at least one supervisor listening in on your calls.

In training our class was a tightly knit group, which I very much enjoyed , but once training was complete, the group was split up and  we were discouraged from maintaining contact.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Login to the telephone and computer systems first thing in the morning and remain active and available for calls all day.  All time is very closely monitored scheduled as to breaks and meal time.

MetLife,Account Executive,3,"MetLife is an OK place to work, I have had jobs I have enjoyed less and jobs I have enjoyed more.Some managers can be very micromanagey, for example, not letting an employee work from home on an 'office day' if they arent feeling well enough to go in but not ill enough to call in sick! This sort of treatment does make employees feel like children, especially when everyone is fully capable of doing the job from home and other employees that live further away or that are 'higher up' in the business get favoured .Managers dont really 'cut any slack' and dont do any favours here, dont ever expect an early finish on a Friday!Lots of travel expected to various events round the country which is really tiring, hours of planes and trains and socialising and  physical work setting up stands etc for no extra bonuses. You might get a cheap free dinner but dont expect to actually see the city you are visiting or have any down time.The work itself is OK, it can be quite varied as you're hosting webinars and having phone calls.Big issues with customer service timelines, meaning many advisers will continually ring you complaining about problems that we have 0 power to fix.Targets dont really get adjusted for things like having to fill in mandatory documents/ updating business plans/ customer service issues so people are always having to work late or during their lunch breaks and on the back foot.Commission and pay is quite good.There's fruit in the office and coffee.Office is in a nice central location.There are some really nice people here.

Serve as a single-point of contact for HR, benefit administrators, brokers, and/or TPA's.

Peak seasons each July and January add an extra challenge.  Least favorite tasks involve billing and remittance handling.  You think going in that the role is purely service but you may be involved with billing depending on the team that you're assigned to.  Some teams have more ancillary support staff than others. "

MetLife,Sr. Customer Care Specialist,1,"You will often hear the best part of this company is its people. This is very true and also a double edged sword. The frontline employees are generally very supportive of one another, however management, to include frontline management, are neglectful at best and micromanagers at worst. This company has terrible work life balance for its front line employees. Because of the people, this company has so much promise, unfortunately poor management/supervisors, unwillingness to update archaic systems/procedures will be its doom. "

Answer more calls, faster, faster. Supervision is little to no help. They belittle you and ignore all communication. I once waited 3 days for my supervisor to email me back with a very important question. You become their labrats. While smiling and brainwashing you into thinking their employees matter. Nope.

UPS,Preloader/Package Handler,2,"The work was physically intensive, but very manageable. Paid weekly, good benefits, and guaranteed hours. However, the company is very scandalous and always breaks rules against the union contract. Management  was very uncaring, arrogant, lazy, and uninformed even about their own policies. Always had to check hours for mistakes, and they'd rarely rectified them. All employees had minimal training and weren't kept to the same standards/consistency. Overall a great place to earn quick money part-time, but a terrible place to spend your life or sanity at."
UPS,Unloader ,1,"They lie about the hours, they waste your gas after you been there for only 30 min. And then send you home they will throw  this   seniority in your face. They do not give you a chance at all, your first week!! People!!"
UPS,Warehouse Worker,1,"The only good thing about this employer is that they are opposed by the Teamster Union. Management will try everything in their power to literally kill you, you make minimum wage for 3 years and you are expected to lift 150 lbs. The culture is toxic, morale is awful, no one is looking out for you but the union. I wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemy."

Incredible career opportunities if you join early in your career - true promote from within culture. Downside is that work life balance is unheard of. Also, it is incredibly hierarchical.

UPS,National Account Manager,3,#NAME?
UPS,Package Handler,4,"You'll start out loading trucks, which is miserable. But after a few months you can bid for a less stressful position. The hours are very hit-and-miss at times. It's a great job for when you're in school. Individual experience can vary, who your supervisor is can make or break your experience"
UPS,Shipper,3,"Good pay and good benefits but being the SCS side of UPS it is non-union and they treat you as such. The people who come in and work will be worked into the ground while those who set a standard of being lazy will have nothing expected of them. Most managers (not all) and higher ups are only there because of their communications or something unless degree so they don't know warehouse work and what is feasible and what's not, to most of them you're not a person, you are your numbers. Most fellow employees make it a better place to work and the benefits are top notch. It's really just a typical warehouse environment - favoritism, some lazy, some hard workers, etc.."

UPS,UPS Supervisor,3,"•typical work day you walk in whenever you start time is, your supervisor will put you in your designated area and provide you with tasks for the day trying to motivate you to work hard and complete the tasks at hand. Time passes fast when you work hard. I learned how to talk to people, lead people, motivate people, and mostly I learned what people like and don’t like in a work environment when trying to communicate.nobody employee likes management there unless you know them personally.Workplace culture, Very social and helps you learn to be, can’t wait to get the day over with sometimes. everyone is either working hard or hardly working. lot of jokes and different humor while feeling like you can’t lift anymore but you do anyways.hardest part is when dealing with bosses telling you how much you can and can’t work depending on how the company is doing, for example, some days you are asked to stay longer to help, some days you are told you get 3 hours max.. Other things include dealing with people complaining about seniority and working hard while seeing others getting paid the same but doing nothing.Most enjoyable part is the physical shape it gets you in.

UPS,Dock Worker,2,Unloading and loading truck in the middle of summer isn’t bad if you’re willing to work. Supervisors are more worried about how fast you can get the job done. Not really any team building just show up work and go home. Not worth the hassle of trying to drive a truck.

UPS,Loader,2,"The school-to-work program can be a great opportunity. They also pay premium during peak (Christmas time). I only came to this job for that reason. After 2.5 years of time served in the inferno, I was free. Other than that expect no one to know what's actually going on. This is a great job to ride the ""doing just enough"" line.

Job duties for my position mainly consisted of loading packages in a timely manner into trailers for transport from the hub, as well as unloading packages from trailers to be processed at the hub. The benefits included health, vision, dental, legal aide, pension, retirement, investors account, life insurance, and more.

UPS,Package Handler and driver helper,5,Enjoyed working as a team player. I have to be able to keep up with fast pace workplace. Enjoyed the coworkers and bosses teaching us stuff we did not catch on to I was a very quick learner
UPS,UPS Package Handler,1,"Most of all the old managers are gone and their experience as well. This causes the new managers and team to fight for their lives in order to understand what's going on. The majority of the work is very hands on and fast, in the summers it can be very grueling and in the winters it can be bitter at least in the warehouse. The benefits and co-workers are good, as there is a nice comradery going on, but you're mostly by yourself unless you are completely fallen behind. "
UPS,Air Ramp Person,3,"If you're in school, or don't need much more than about 25 hours per week, it's easy work with good benefits. While the hourly rate is good, it can be difficult to get more hours without becoming a supervisor."
UPS,Part Time Supervisor,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Getting paid to work out. Free insurance after probationary period. If you go driving,  you can make six figures easily. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Always a time crunch, no matter the area.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's a warehouse.  So, no climate control. Osha is all over the place, water and ice dispensers are everywhere.  Managers always want employees to be paid correctly for their time. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Wake up before dawn, walk about 9 miles, pick up 100lb items, go home dirty. Rinse, repeat."
UPS,Air Ramp,2,Simple job but dangerous aspects all around especially out. Multiple injuries this year. Training is decent if you pay attention and get a good trainer otherwise you're learning as you go and quickly 
UPS,Unloader,5,"Fast paced , room for growth if you work hard. Lots of diversity and opportunities but you have to reallly want it. Your lucky if you get to just breeze through."
UPS,Loader/Unloader,3,It was hard manual labor. Didn’t understand what I was getting into. I ended loading trailers by myself at 2 in the morning. On a good note if you work hard you are able to advance quickly. 
UPS,Decent,5,Ok depending on the day most days if we don’t get a lot of work but for the most part it’s ok I’m sure the pay is good for some but for some it’s not ok but that’s ok too hopefully it will be ok next year
UPS,Unloader,5,If you wanna work at 4am everyday and work every second until 9:20…. This job is for you. Great benefits and paid time off. If you like a workout in the morning this job is right for you.
UPS,Package Handler,3,Bad management and communication and not answering phone  it’s a good place to work just need better communication when answering phone or listening to employees that are good workers 
UPS,GBS,3,Appropriate facilities to exercise all tasks from day to day.
UPS,Warehouse Worker,3,Very physically demanding job. It’s a lot of unloading trailers and loading packages cars at a very fast demanding pace. This job is definitely not for the weak.
UPS,Operations Supervisor,5,Great hard working environment great medical benefits awesome school tuition assistance. Awesome opportunity for growth and development mentoring by senior management. Great recognition for meeting goals.
UPS,Loader/Unloader,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Some coworkers work as a team. Some supervisors micromanage you and some don’t What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Equipment not working properly. Bags causing skin rash. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?To laid back for some workers. I see people on their phone a lot and not wearing  proper shoes. Supervisors giving employees incorrect information about policies. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy. Annoying when I’m working and coworkers on their phones or disappearing to the restroom frequently and for long periods of time.
UPS,Customer Service Associate,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?I was able to help my hispanic people and just people in general. Which made me feel very helpful and supportive when they needed it.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Owners being very toxic and mean. Being very misunderstanding at times and talking about workers behind their backs. Another thing customers being rude,mean, uncooperative made the job even more harder especially on a busy day with just one employee on sight.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The environment and culture could be different every day. For example some days it would be very quiet and slow other days it could be loud and busy especially on those peak seasons where everyone from all different places want to ship items to there countries and or another state.What is a typical day like for you at the company?A typical day for me was receiving amazon returns or any returns in general like shien, temu, tiktok shop place like that. closing out the returns which means scanning all the items one by one with there individual colors they have to be picked up by the drivers. Shipping was another big thing at that store i had to be really careful with addresses, names and states it was going to. scanning in mailbox holders items that they had purchased to put in there mailboxes this was a every day thing. calling mailbox holders to pay for their mailboxes was also something i had to do everyday"
UPS,Preloader,4,People you work with are great management sucks but that's anywhere you go. Not going to sit here and trash the place but they could do a better job in allowing people to show their worth. You make a mistake and you're crucified. Good thing is it's union and they got your back.
UPS,UPS Package Delivery helper,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Definitely a good experience being a driver helper during holiday season What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Wanting To driver instead of being in the passenger seat lolWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?I loved it! It was a lot of movement, no seating around everyone was busy!What is a typical day like for you at the company?Excitement! I Couldn't wait for the day to be over So I can start again"
UPS,Loader/Unloader,4,pretty good and relaxed job. can get stressful at times but if you are willing to work hard then it isnt that bad as people make it seem. pay is good.
UPS,UPS Package Handler,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The hands on constant maneuvering and movement was one of my favorite things working there. Working and and getting paid to do it in a safe fun environment What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Making sure trailers are loaded properly in a timely matter with no mistakes What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Fun, energetic, fast paced,well managed with all kinds of different people all striving to do the job well and accurately What is a typical day like for you at the company?A typical day for me at UPS is busy ,structured and organized"
UPS,Store Associate,4,"Manager had a unique lack of respect, but it’s a good working enviroment, sometimes confusing training but easy to intuit and not difficult whatsoever."
UPS,Loader/Unloader,4,You need strength and stamina here.                                                Good chance to work extra shifts during the holidays. It’s hard work. Hot in the summer cold in the winter. 
UPS,Manager,1,Worked at UPS for over 13 years.   But the last six years have seen the company fall so much.  Very bad management and respect or care for employees. 
UPS,Supervisor,4,Hard work very physical labor. Different career path opportunities. Diverse work group. Usually have weekends off with set consistent schedule. Not bad.
UPS,Loader/Unloader,3,The environment is worker friendly for the most part. It’s fast paced but the supervisors do a good job at spreading the workload where you won’t load the fastest pace trailer all the time
UPS,Retail Sales Associate,5,walking when you’re walking down the street and everybody I said I get along with each other and I say what a wonderful time today where we could learn to work and play and get along with each other
UPS,Package Car Driver,1,Best part of this company is the benefits and pay.  But they purposely make it difficult to continue coming to work because they don't want to pay so much.  Morale is terrible as is the culture.  
UPS,Driver Helper,2,"Very unorganized, youll be lucky if you get your pay when you are supposed to, drivers are good guys but management is nearly impossible to work with or for. "
UPS,Warehouse Associate,2,"Very toxic work environment, constantly overworked and working in bad conditions, unsafe maintnence and coworkers and supervisors not held accountable."
UPS,Loader/Unloader,4,When it comes to working on the load it can be very hard but not impossible you will feel like you’re being drowned in boxes especially during peak season but if you can keep a straight head on top of the benefits that come with the job it’s a pretty good job.
UPS,UPS Package Handler,3,"Fast paced, help others, learn fast, most of the workers are nice, most of the bosses are nice, come in very early each day, off the weekend if you're temp you're let go in a month after starting"
UPS,Package Handler,4,"Decent pay (currently $21 starting) and great benefits, health care plan is free after 9 months of employment. Don’t expect to get a full time job here without putting in years of service."
UPS,Ramp Worker,4,"I'm an older worker and enjoy the work out.  I work on the ramp, at World Port, mostly loading cans in planes. The supervisors are great, but seem under a lot of stress from their superiors. Most handle the stress very well, while others  seems overwhelmed. My current supervisor is amazing. I've  been here for 4 months during the hot summer months and the company provides ice, water and breaks. My coworkers are hard working, fun to work with,  and dedicated, but tend to be somewhat negative.  If you can handle the heat and cold, this is a good job. "
UPS,Operations Supervisor,4,The work is very physically demanding but you will meet some really cool people. Sometimes when you have questions it’s not that easy to get answers to stuff you really need an answer to.
UPS,Warehouse Supervisor,2,Ups was once a company you could turn into a career but now they layoff for no reason and replace you with temporary workers. Ups has turn into a job not a career 
UPS,Customer Service Associate,3,"Working here was fine, it had its moments of ups and downs but the worst part was the immense amount of Amazon returns you have to deal with. And half the customers don't know what they are doing so they make you do it for them. And what really stinks is knowing that 90% of the amazon returns are going to go into a landfill. If you can get through dumb customers you'll be fine"
UPS,Data entry medewerker,2,"What is the best thing about working at the company? There are no positive opinions what is the most stressful thing about working at the company? Lack of clear work rules, incompetent superiors, unpleasant colleagues, poor working atmosphere how are the working environment and working culture at the company?Compared to gossiping and betraying what does a typical day look like at the company? Morning meeting and division of tasks.Implementation under the control of the leader."
UPS,Customer Service Associate,1,"Very horrible managers. The two married managers took a FULL WEEK off for vacation after a week of hiring me, without letting me know during the interview. Training never was finished with me working 4 1/2 weeks. Not trained properly at all. Could only speak English when they let you know when to go on break & horrible at explaining things the right way. Was told I would receive uniform shirt after 2 weeks, did not receive. "
UPS,Human Resources Assistant,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The staff was amazing n working with employees and given employees a chance to voice their concerns.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Ther was nothing stressful about the position I was in.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment and culture were family like situation. Everyone was trated like family.What is a typical day like for you at the company?A typical day was interviewing candidates for jobs. Answering phones and getting packets together for new hires.
UPS,Package Car Driver,1,"Management are terrible, put undue and unfair pressure onto staff to cover up their own shortcomings.Culture used to be good in the company but is now relentlessly focussed on profit, cost cutting and productivity. Total lack of care for workers, their well being and zero interest in their lives outside of work.They are actively seeking to replace people who are on good contracts and who have decent benefits with people on more a more precarious employment status.Avoid!"
Goldman Sachs,Risk Analyst,3,Job is dull pay is low working place is boring.  Make you feel being exiled for how little resources are being allocated in office that are not nyc.  
Goldman Sachs,Industrial Trainee,5,"The company offers a positive and learning-focused work culture, providing employees with opportunities to grow and develop their skills. The work environment is collaborative, with teams that are supportive and encourage mutual learning. While the compensation is average, the company makes up for it with a global presence, which allows for exposure to diverse markets and international perspectives. Additionally, the wide range of projects and tasks under one roof ensures that employees are constantly challenged and engaged, making it a great place for those looking to gain versatile experience."
Goldman Sachs,Senior Analyst,4,"Working at Goldman Sachs can be challenging and intense at times, but ultimately, it is worth it considering the knowledge and experience you gain. I highly recommend for young post-grads. "
Goldman Sachs,Financial Customer Service Representative,3,If you are single or have a spouse it works. If you have a family working from home is extremely difficult. They also don’t care if you have technical issues out of your control such as internet issues.
Goldman Sachs,Associate,3,"It was mostly stressful working at GS but the brand on resume helps getting ahead in future. No WLB, free gym though and food covered if you work after hours"
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,5,"It was a good learning experience especially for  a beginner. This will of course vary from team to team, and also the position but still  is a positive place to work at."
Goldman Sachs,Compliance Analyst,3,"You will work with exceptionally smart and driven people, however if you are an Army Reservist who is actively going on missions or schools you will have a terrible time. The firm provides a generous compensation package for Army Reservists, but the management is not understanding of the struggles of balancing both careers. Also some managers demonstrate poor leadership due to their youth and inexperience (only have Goldman experience). Compensation is slightly lower than their competitors and its difficult to get good raises unless you stay in for around 5+ years. Great place to start your career, but seems to be terrible if you are thinking of staying long term."
Goldman Sachs,Stockbroker,5,It’s a very good job hard work but it is definitely payed off and the people here are great would recommend to anyone lookin to work in the city or around stocks in general
Goldman Sachs,Vice President,2,The highest attrition rate of any company I’ve worked for!  B/c of this everyone remaining is basically doing the work of at least 1.5 to 2 individuals. 
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,5,Great place to be able to grow and learning from associates at the firm. There has been a learning curve but management has provided me the guidance that i need. 
Goldman Sachs,Investment Banking Analyst,5,I worked for two years as an investment banking analyst. I had a good experience but had to work many long hours under extreme stress given the nature of the transactions we worked on.
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,2,"The SLC branch of the company is heavily focused on operations, leading to a significant amount of routine, often menial work. Teams are frequently overworked, with the company mandating a minimum of 50-hour workweeks, although it is common for employees to exceed this number. New hires receive minimal training, and there is an over-reliance on colleagues to teach them how to perform their roles. Senior analysts and associates, overwhelmed by their workloads, often lack the time to address questions or provide guidance. A substantial number of employees express dissatisfaction with their work, citing the demanding hours and high workload. Complaints about burnout are common, and the work environment is challenging for those who do not quickly adapt to the job's demands, with managers being less than forgiving for mistakes made within the first months of the job. Asking too many questions is seen as a bad thing and seeking help outside of the team from other coworkers willing to help is discouraged.While some weeks may be less intense, it is not unusual for employees to stay late, often until 7 or even 8 PM, resulting in 12-hour workdays. Additionally, the company relies heavily on contingent workers (CWs) to handle a significant portion of the workload. Unfortunately, these workers receive no benefits, and even basic amenities like access to the infirmary are restricted to full-time employees only. The pay is also subpar when comparing the amount and hours everyone in the company puts in.  "
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,4,The most intense 2 years of work experience but the absolutely best training ground for networking and a career in finance. The people you meet will become your colleagues and friends down the road!
Goldman Sachs,Senior Analyst,4,"Working at Goldman Sachs is dynamic and challenging, offering exposure to high-profile deals, a fast-paced environment, and opportunities for growth in global finance."
Goldman Sachs,Associate,2,"Extremely long work hours, not competitive pay, legacy systems, lot of orthodox thinking, only thing is benefits are decent but otherwise if work life balance matters, stay away"
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,5,"great PTO, sick time, and benefits. They really care about their employees' wellbeing, which i really value. Management is very understanding them it comes to needing time off "
Goldman Sachs,Associate,4,"Excellent induction, great quality of work.Extremely supportive team membersOpen exchange between team members is encouragedDifferent teams have different promotion criteria but you should be good till VP"
Goldman Sachs,Associate,2,No work life balance. Toxic Environment. You should have some life for yourself. Went into depression. Coping can be tough. If you are all about money than you can join GS
Goldman Sachs,Intern,4,"Good culture that supports growth, final project is fun, long hours and hard work is expected. would recommend for fresh grad, good brand name, friendly batchmates"
Goldman Sachs,Associate,4,"They expect a lot from you, but they do reward their staff well.  Learning to navigate internal politics is a must to succeed, no is not a word that exists especially if you are dealing with middle management"
Goldman Sachs,Vice President,4,"Pros: Lots of opportunity to learn and grow even outside of your current role;  Ability to work on challenging projects with brilliant people;  Better than market compensationCons:  Operates incredibly lean and under aggressive, frequently unrealistic, timelines so lots of long hours and weekends;  Given lean staffing in management it is difficult to develop relationships with your manager unless they are located in your office"
Goldman Sachs,Risk Analyst,3,Job is dull pay is low working place is boring.  Make you feel being exiled for how little resources are being allocated in office that are not nyc.  
Goldman Sachs,Investment Banking Analyst,5,"Goldman Sachs investment banking is rigorous with a demanding culture and grueling hours. It's a sink-or-swim environment that pushes you to your limits, albeit teaching invaluable skills rapidly. It's a place where resilience is tested daily, offering exposure to high-stakes deals and complex financial transactions. Despite the challenges, it's a launchpad for your career, providing unparalleled learning opportunities and a prestigious resume boost. If you thrive under pressure and seek rapid growth, Goldman Sachs can be a valuable and rewarding but intense experience."
Goldman Sachs,Senior Analyst,3,Pros - Clear career progression - Career opportunities if you do your job well - Great pay and benefits - Brand name helps with other aspects outside of work- World-leading experts in their respective fields who one can learn a lot from Cons - 11-15 hours a day in the office - Management can be great but needs luck - Expectation is for you to be available almost 24/7 with an exception for Saturdays - Stressful environment that can take a toll over time 
Goldman Sachs,IT Technician,4,"Working as an IT technician at Goldman Sachs offers a dynamic environment with challenging tasks, excellent growth opportunities, and exposure to cutting-edge technology in finance."
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,4,Great job and learned a lot. The management is stern but helpful and so were my co-workers. They allowed me to grow and develop professionally. It was a great experience. 
Goldman Sachs,Process Assistant,5,"Not a bad job , just too much micromanaging . The work its self is simple and easy . Training was fun but soon as I went to production it was strictly business."
Goldman Sachs,Associate,3,"At goldman it is easy to get an opportunity to work on anything you want. Bad thing is that much of the work that youd be interested is low quality compared to other companies. If you want a pre other job experience, this is an okay place. Using NDS sucks though"
Goldman Sachs,Operations Analyst,4,"It’s a company where being productive is the only possible outcome. An extremely fast paced environment in which the stakes are really high. Definitely not for everyone. But compensation is good, benefits are good, and the employees’ are treated better than the average company in the industry"
Goldman Sachs,Internship,4,"I had a very nice internship here. The building is pretty awesome, the people are very friendly and smart. I was in the engineering department so I can’t say anything about IB."
Goldman Sachs,Contract Negotiator,3,"-interesting international transactions with motivated colleagues-don't push legacy buttons/better not ask or complain-competing against your colleagues, who you should rely on creates weird atmosphere "
Goldman Sachs,Vice President,5,GS is a great workplace for high achievers willing to work hard and collaborate with colleagues.  They treat employees respectfully and professionally.  Great place to learn and grow.
Goldman Sachs,Vice President,4,A lot of opportunity to grow. Very high energy and demanding roles. Best paymaster across the industry.You'll get all the possible resources Nad support for getting work done. 
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,3,good pay. great benefits and work variety. Management can be challenging at times. workload can be high. culture is competitive and career outlook is rough.
Goldman Sachs,Cust. Service Rep,1,"Joke. But stayed as long as I could. Any problems that came up. My managers and the lead always took sides. There was no work balance. If your internet is down, you get a point. If you have system issues because of their system issues, points against you. They’re  very good at wording things when it comes to write ups and verbals. Manipulative. Managers and the specific  sr manager remind me of cons and hide behind the truth. I’m trying to figure out if the pay is worth all the anxiety and stress they give you ???? Bonus enjoy being yelled at by their unsatisfied customers. "
Goldman Sachs,Associate,5," offers unparalleled exposure to high-profile transactions and deals. The learning curve is steep, but it provides a robust foundation in financial analysis and deal structuring."
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,3,"Smart peers, good training ground that will land you strong exit opps, but long hours and lots of politics, harder to make into a long term career and move up internally vs 5-10 yrs ago "
Goldman Sachs,WMP,2,Culturally it’s a tough company to fit into. I’d recommend looking elsewhere for private wealth management. There’s minimal training and you’re expected to know everything.
Goldman Sachs,Associate,2,"This career choice was an excellent move to gain industry experience and climb the ladder.  However, by the time my 2nd week was over I was convinced I made the worst decision of my life.  You spend your first week in training and by the start of your 2nd week, you are expected to know the ins and outs of the project you just started working on.  If you don't, your manager will mock and humiliate you during meetings with your peers present.  All attempts to defend yourself to your manager are met with petty retaliations, additional humiliations, and more even micromanagement.  Your managers superiors are in so many meetings that any time spent with them is only in the presence of your manager.  Their HR department claims to have a policy where you can report behaviors such as this anonymously, however the fear of retaliation is so great, that it's not worth seeking out their assistance."
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,3,"Good place to work if you want to learn more about finance, especially if you are in the controllers, finance, treasury, and asset management division"
Goldman Sachs,Associate,3,"Good pay very smart people. However, if you make the smallest mistake it’s like someone died and there are a bunch of sit down conversations over it. "
Goldman Sachs,Help Desk Technician,3,"I absolutely adored my direct team, but I also learned things of why amazing managers DID NOT want to move up, the occasional wipe out/ ""layoff"" of a ton of long term employees is sickening, they don't care about their people, but they do have a lot of good people"
Goldman Sachs,Risk Analyst,3,Job is dull pay is low working place is boring.  Make you feel being exiled for how little resources are being allocated in office that are not nyc.  
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,5,Good place to start career as a software developer. I’ve learnt a lot and developed lot of applications during my starting years. Great teammates and culture. Greatful to the firm.
Goldman Sachs,Vice President,2,"Your experience will vary given which team you're on. Overall, morale in SLC Credit is poor. The firm is very cheap; there isn't enough seating for everyone, so you will be constantly moved around the floor as they play musical chairs. In addition to being herded around like sheep, there are always shortages of equipment, so you might arrive one morning to find your keyboard or headset gone. Other than your comp, the firm will never spend a dime on you. You will never travel, you will never meet a client, you're not even allowed to bring your spouse to the holiday party. You'll be lucky if your team is treated to lunch once a year. Go ahead and throw away your suit and tie because you'll want to be in something more comfortable to sit at a desk for 8-12 hours a day; you're not going to do anything besides that. Given the above, turnover is terrible. Because of their inability to retain good people, teams are always behind on their tasks which leads to long hours, burnout, and more turnover. You'll likely be one of the more senior people on your team after a year because everyone else has quit. It's a vicious cycle that even the bank regulators are becoming concerned about. Management knows it's bad but won't do anything about it, instead they gush about how great and special the GS culture is. As a new analyst, Goldman is ok as you'll learn some skills and get their name on your resume, but after you make VP, your career is very limited. GS does not have Director titles in Credit (again, because Credit isn't important), so 99% of people will plateau at VP. Managing Director - more..."
Goldman Sachs,CEO and Founder,5,"Super awesome place to work, I get to make lots of money every day while playing minesweeper. Good job for teenagers looking for a summer job or immigrants who don't speak English. Highly recommend."
Goldman Sachs,Controller,4,"Great career opportunity if you can get it early in your career but definitely lots of work. Your team will really make or break your experience there, but not a bad company"
Goldman Sachs,Financial Analyst,3,"it is an incredibly high-paced environment where nothing short of perfection is acceptable, you get to work with some of the smartest people in the country and the world and you get to take on many interesting projects. but the work hours are too long and you get pretty much no work life balance. the pay is extraordinary and there are many opportunities for both career growth and bonuses"
Goldman Sachs,Associate,3,"Overall it was a great experience. Demanding workload, but a lot of opportunity to grow. Exit opportunities are tremendous and can help you land your dream job, so long as you put in a few years."
Goldman Sachs,Savings Specialist,4,Good career development if you put in the work. Lots of amazing people and lots of not so amazing people there. Learned a lot about corporate life and how to succeed within it. 
Goldman Sachs,Operations Analyst,4,"Good place to work, but you work a lot and it’s not for everyone. Great resume builder, people tend to not stay that long as burnout is real. Glad I worked there, glad I left. "
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,4,Every around you is very smart. It is quite a competitive culture and extremely motivated teams. You learn a lot being at the firm. Work life balance is not too bad. 
Goldman Sachs,Associate,2,"Pros - get to work with really smart peopleCons - so much politics to navigate especially as you get more senior, not about your work but who you have on side, really long hours, lots of red tape to get anything approved, lots of people who fight against innovation and change, lack of transparency on salary (you can be on one figure and the person sitting next to you doing the same job can be on a lot more"
Goldman Sachs,Senior controller analyst ,2,"The culture at Goldman Sachs is fantastic for someone early in their career. Everyone is highly intelligent, driven, and extremely collaborative. The biggest downside is that pay is lower compared to competitors and poor work life balance. An easy work week was 50 hours but often my team worked 60 to 65 hours with late nights and weekend work."
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,5,Very little turnover within our office over the past 30 years.Enjoyed working with our team.Always upgrading different systems and I was a big part in seeing these projects through.
Goldman Sachs,Specialist,5,No micromanagement and friendly team members and team lead. Employee benefits are excellent compared to industry standards. Learning is never ending in this company
Goldman Sachs,Specialist,4,Very good place to start your journey. Supportive and not great salaries but good enough for a fresher. I have learned a lot of new stuff regarding the banking and US markets. offers free courses to keep you updated.
Goldman Sachs,Global Markets Supervisory Risk & Controls Manager,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Quality of talent there is amazing.  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Too much politics and competition; everyone tries to pull each other down to make themselves look good.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It’s pretty competitive, at all levels of the firm.  If you’re not ready to sacrifice your personal life for success, you won’t feel comfortable.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Lots of meetings, strategic thinking and hard work"
Goldman Sachs,Specialist,4,"Don’t go by GS brand, do more research more about company and role before joining the firm. Food and Cab charges are very high. Not a employee friendly organisation "
Goldman Sachs,Cliente services ,5,"Very good place to work, career opportunities, good management, work life balance, very good pay, opportunities to work worldwide. I would definitely recommend "
Goldman Sachs,VP,1,"Unless you are a fresh grad puting in your two years to get experience, avoid GS at all costs. Below market pay and way above market politics. The exit ops dont exist anymore. "
Goldman Sachs,Risk Analyst,4,"The struggle to balance compensation, career incentives, and lifestyle benefits is a challenge. Also, the compensation should be better because the base salary is too low compared to the industry average."
Goldman Sachs,Associate,1,Depends if your goal aligns with Teams goals. If the goals and learning expectations are aligned then it's a good place to work. Work life balance depends on Team.
Goldman Sachs,Risk Analyst,3,Job is dull pay is low working place is boring.  Make you feel being exiled for how little resources are being allocated in office that are not nyc.  
Goldman Sachs,Fx Trade Services,4,"typically what you’d expect, surrounded by very driven folks. Culture is great and inclusive. Have to learn time management with the workload and time pressure"
Goldman Sachs,Associate,3,"It’s very satisfying to work with such smart people. Projects move faster; communication is easier. 5 day in-office mandate is terrible, especially when most other IBs are still hybrid"
Goldman Sachs,Investment Banking Analyst,5,"Can't complain. Good pay, the new lifestyle. You learn a lot and make good connections for someone who is really young. The long hours aren't great, but they teach you how to work hard."
Goldman Sachs,Associate Fund Controller,3,"Tedious interview process spanning over several weeks. Great experience once in the door, but long hours were the norm. Pay was not so great - value was more in the prestige that came with working for a well known company. Bonus was discretionary and not consistent."
Goldman Sachs,Executive Assistant,5,I had a great experience working here for 2 years. They provided all the tools for success and growth. I learned a lot here and wouldn’t trade my experience for anything 
Goldman Sachs,Fraud Investigation Analyst,3,"Im going on 120 days within the company. Still no direct manager. There was little training, and ZERO SOPs. Whats scary is im unsure of what controls are actually in place. Because theres no standards, its based off whose opinion your speaking to. ( its not always right) Frustration is an understatement. Theres more people without managers in my department then with. I cant believe a company this size is like this. GS still thinks its name excuses its lack of competence. From first contact to start date took 5 months. "
Goldman Sachs,Vice President,4,"Very competigtive, but worth being in GS to keep challenging to own capabilities and keep learning in a dynamic and diverse working environment. Need to fully understand the strong and unique culture to be successful. "
Goldman Sachs,Vice President of Operations,5,"This place rocks! Ever since I was a little boy in the trailer park back in good ol West Virginia I dreamed of having a job that creates no product, provides no actual service of value to society, but pays crazy money! Look Ma, I made it!"
Goldman Sachs,Investment Banking Analyst,5,"Intense experience that taught me much and has benefited in my career outside of Goldman and Investment Banking. I wish I would have let myself enjoy it more, but glad I completed the program. It helped to open up doors for me down the road. "
Goldman Sachs,Associate,5,"given lots of autonomy depending on your role. surrounded by very smart, hardworking individuals, so super easy to collaborate (ppl get what you mean very easily and are willing to effectively provide input)"
Goldman Sachs,Senior Associate,1,"Its not a good place to be in for work. Its politics, mostly politics, connections, favoritism, partialism. Even if you are not working with full dedication and dont have any skills, the chances of promotion are high given the fact you are doing things not related to work such as organising events and  "
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,3,"Toxic people, leadership, and no work life balance. Making good money is a possibility if you work a lot and climb the corporate ladder. Great place to start but maybe not long term"
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,5,Lots of work but had a good experience. You won’t sleep a lot but you will make friends who go through the same and those friendships will last a long time.
Goldman Sachs,Human Resources Generalist,3,"Good place to build your experience, but you will work long hours. Very competitive work environment, team oriented. Building downtown is nice, culture is not for everyone "
Goldman Sachs,Vp,3,Ok it is very stressful company to work in but the pay is good.  Promotion depend on your job performance and how uou interact with people.  Definitely relationship help
Goldman Sachs,Associate,4,Fast paced work environment with hit or miss managers. Overall great experience but long hours for less pay than other offerings in the market for certain roles
Goldman Sachs,Senior Analyst,4,Great parental leave for all employees.  20 weeks paid.  Lots of PTO and paid sick days as well. Culture depends massively on your Managing Director.  A bad MD can make or break your career.
Goldman Sachs,Security Analyst,1,"The WLB is so bad that you wanna cry, and there is so much work politics and you can only survive if you kiss your managers a. I would recommend you not to join "
Goldman Sachs,Administrative Assistant,1,Very territorial and rude staff . So many untouchables and nepotism.They are not who they say they: pretenders everywhere. Especially the ones who pretend to know.
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,4,Demanding but productive environment. Would recommend for others considering a place to start their career and learn several important skills / meet people. 
Goldman Sachs,Risk Analyst,3,Job is dull pay is low working place is boring.  Make you feel being exiled for how little resources are being allocated in office that are not nyc.  
Goldman Sachs,Vice President,5,Highly recommend to anyone looking. It is a fantastic culture and I respect it. Anyone should apply for this company because it is truly a wonderful place 
Goldman Sachs,Associate,1,"Been with the company for almost a decade and the ""David Solomon"" leadership era is destroying the company. Employees are having PTO taken from them, annual wage increase can't even give 50% of inflation. Bonuses are at an all time low and work expectations are more demanding than ever.The company is embarrassing themselves publicly, likely going to be having a lot of issues with the Fed given the poor leadership and terrible focus. The highest members of leadership (Managing Directors) will spend Hours of their day trying to get Emails to look nice rather than focusing on anything important.  "
Goldman Sachs,Credit Analyst,2,learning at the firm is pretty good and they do a great job of training people and getting you up to speed. The issue with the firm is sometimes there is egomaniac management that take things way to personal and will then go out of their way to stunt career growth. 
Goldman Sachs,Fraud Analyst,3,"I would regularly work 60 to 80 hours a week, not paid anywhere near where I should have been paid. Enjoyed my coworkers but it felt like management was apathetic about a lot of things. "
Goldman Sachs,Technical Analyst,4,A great work environment with many bright people where everyone works as a team. Various duties which make things interesting. Interact with people from many other areas and do firm-critical functions. Benefits are very good.
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,4,"GS is an amazing place to network and meet people from different walks of life, and the opportunities for career advancement are great. There's also a big emphasis on lateral movement if you feel like you need a new challenge. "
Goldman Sachs,Customer Service Representative Chat,5,"Fun place to work, very enjoyable it’s a great job very good company and good people. They always have something going on in the company, giveaways, cookouts, game days, etc. "
Goldman Sachs,Vice President,4,It’s very competitive environment n very stressful work. Long working hours n multiple projects along with day to day with very limited resources. Career progression is very fast in Goldman Sachs 
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,5,"really great culture, great learning experience.  tough hours, but great training and you get to meet great people. everyone truly cares about the team, culture and doing great work."
Goldman Sachs,Vice President,5,I worked there for many years.    I enjoyed worked with bright energetic  people toward well defined goals.   It was generous compensation wise.    Not a place for those who don't want to work hard. 
Goldman Sachs,Associate,3,"It’s okay but they don’t pay enough. Depending on what team you are on there is a huge gap in pay even for people at the same level. Also, now everyone is back in office full time."
Goldman Sachs,Associate,5,Learnt a lot of stuff! Pay is great. Competitive work culture. Weekly Dinners and outings. Management was cool. Colleagues are great. HR department takes any escalation seriously
Goldman Sachs,Summer Analyst,4,Great place for networking and a good corporate culture . As an intern it was a place to be. You’ll get many perks and networking opportunities . I recommend 
Goldman Sachs,Analyst,4,Good to start your career here and transition to basically anywhere else thereafter. People don’t generally enjoy life while working here but the pay is decent if you’re there long enough. 
Goldman Sachs,IT Analyst,5,Invested a lot in training junior team members. Culture highly focused on excellence and buying into the team. Highly collaborative culture as well.  
Goldman Sachs,Summer Intern,4," Learning was top-notch, with real-world insights that went beyond the textbooks. Had real responsibilities that made a genuine impact. Fast paced and long hours tho"
Goldman Sachs,Risk Analyst,5,Challenging work but you're surrounded by the best and brightest in the industry. Wish they would extend the hybrid work arrangement but the office is a pretty nice work environment.
Goldman Sachs,Associate Software Developer,4,"Company has good culture, but the work life balance is worst.  You will be working with lot of internal technologies which might be useless in the outside world "
Goldman Sachs,Summer Analyst,3,"Working at a big firm right out the gate is certainly exciting (the immediate post-Linkedin-announcement rush is unbeatable), but at the end of the day you’re just a number amongst thousands of others. Kind management but lots of red tape."
Goldman Sachs,Equity Research,3,"Goldman can be great or terrible. It honestly all depends on the division you work in, your manager, your co-workers, etc. I had two managers, one in my office and another across the country. The manager in my office location was fantastic. The manager across the country was not. The workload also depends. At my job in GIR, I was averaging 100-hour work weeks. My coworker in a different industry was around 50. The people you work with tend to be good people. It just depends, and you should have many discussions with different people you will work with to see if you like it."
Morgan Stanley,Service Associate,4,"If unlicensed, this role is pretty entry-level. There is room to grow if you obtain your securities licenses. Having your licenses allows you more opportunities to work directly with brokers and/ or earn bonuses. "
Morgan Stanley,Operations Associate,3,Great company to have worked for. Key word “worked”. The name alone is impressive and they will give you an average quality of life. Beware that the firm will let even it’s best workers go during gloomy economic times. If you want a very corporate life this is your place.
Morgan Stanley,Investment Associate,4,I met many successful investment professionals through MS programs and was able to learn about a bunch of different teams. This helped in learning more about my career path.
Morgan Stanley,Financing and Collateral Operations Associate ,4,"enjoyed my time there. Management can be cut throat, and thing change very often. so prepare yourself for that. Very good benefits. Difficult to grow career "
Morgan Stanley,Team Lead,4,"You get to impact representatives directly by answering their questions. Take client escalations, train and develop new agents. Overall experience was good. Lots of opportunity to move to different roles in the company. "
Morgan Stanley,Relationship Manager,3,"The work itself is fine. The difficulty comes in with lack of transparency, constant micro managing with sales goals, and low pay compared to the industry standard. "
Morgan Stanley,Client Service Representative,1,"The hiring process took forever.  Most of their employees are hired through temp agencies and they usually don't hire on afterwards or they string you along for months or years. Management is poor. Awful communication. They are constantly having tech issues and then blame you when you can't perform your job functions.  They make themselves out to be this ""World Class"" company, but they really aren't.  "
Morgan Stanley,Forklift Operator,3,Catalyst for for a a long long term term investment investment strategy strategy is is the the growth growth cycle cycle cycle cycle cycle cycle cycle of 
Morgan Stanley,Analyst,4,Enjoyed my time as an analyst. The management wanted you to exceed. The training was solid and the pay too. Wish I had some more time there but had another offer. 
Morgan Stanley,Associate,4,Work life balance is good here. Hybrid model - 3 days ago in a week is mandatory. Salary package is good with lots of other health care benefits and insurance 
Morgan Stanley,Account Representative,1,You’ll be a temp for years if you don’t speak up and your work will not be praised as far as your performance. They tell you how “easy” it is to get hired on but unfortunately that’s not true! 
Morgan Stanley,Operations Analyst,3,It all depends on which team you get put in. My time so far has been fun but the work can be tedious and boring. Also the hiring process can be stressful and annoying.
Morgan Stanley,Wealth Management Associate,5,"Great culture, awesome systems, and competitive pay. I like the location a lot and the people! I have been working here for 9 years now and look forward to many more years."
Morgan Stanley,Wealth Management Intern,5,Great opportunities for college students to gain financial knowledge. Not the typical intern work and the advisors are interested in your advancement.
Morgan Stanley,Senior Associate,4,"Morgan Stanley offers a solid starting point for freshers through its Technology Analyst Program (TAP), providing a valuable platform for learning and networking. The TAP program is well-structured and allows new graduates to gain hands-on experience across a variety of technologies and domains. This exposure, combined with the chance to build a strong internal network, makes it a great opportunity for freshers looking to grow their skills in a global financial firm.However, the compensation can be a bit underwhelming compared to industry standards, especially given the demands of the role. While the work hours are flexible, they tend to be long, with many employees finding themselves working late to meet deadlines or tackle ongoing projects.The work culture at Morgan Stanley is highly dependent on the team you’re placed in. Some teams have a great environment, are collaborative, and use modern tech stacks, offering opportunities to work with the latest tools and technologies. Other teams, however, may not be as forward-thinking or supportive, which can impact the overall work experience."
Morgan Stanley,VP,4,Many smart people here. You can learn lots here very quickly. Long hours culture can take over your life. Money not as good as you might expect it to be.
Morgan Stanley,Portfolio Analyst,4,"Learned a lot, made some great friends too. Had a smart boss who mentored me and gave me many opportunities to grow my career. Spent many years there. "
Morgan Stanley,Senior Client Service Representative,5,"Morgan Stanley is an all around great place to work.  It is a worldly company, i learned so much in my 33 years there about investments.  My management was great.   "
Morgan Stanley,Associate,5,"Great company. Morgan Stanley is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered at 1585 Broadway in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. With offices in 41 countries and more than 75,000 employees, the firm's clients include corporations, governments, institutions, and individuals "
Morgan Stanley,Intern,5,"My team is great and attentive, the internship is helping a lot in my development.Internship salary and the benefits are very competitive in the market."
Morgan Stanley,Customer Service,3,Productive place where thingsGet done however at a heavy mental cost. It becomes very difficult to go to work everyday and not want to just yell at every person who calls and thinks they know more than you
Morgan Stanley,Service Associate,4,"If unlicensed, this role is pretty entry-level. There is room to grow if you obtain your securities licenses. Having your licenses allows you more opportunities to work directly with brokers and/ or earn bonuses. "
Morgan Stanley,Financial Representative,4,"There provide a great support system. It may be difficult at first to adjust, but if you see it through it could be very rewarding. It may not be something you want to do long-term"
Morgan Stanley,Relationship Manager,3,"Good brand and experience to have on your resume. Great experience working with & selling to HNW investors. Comp changes happen often and greatly reduced my earning power, good first two years though"
Morgan Stanley,Vice President,3,"Good industry leading tools but the actual quality of talent there was surprising.  Compensation was competitive but as with most large companies, constant management restructuring leads to ambiguity and a seemingly rudderless ship."
Morgan Stanley,Cashier/scheduler/receptionist,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Great management & co-workers and benefits are wonderful What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Financial Advisors wanting everything done at immediately What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Environment is nice up to date desk and phones office is brand new the culture every nationality works in the office and everyone gets alone with each other What is a typical day like for you at the company?Phones ringing work to be done clients coming In questions to be answered
Morgan Stanley,Branch Admin,3,"If you're a financial advisor, it's a pretty great gig. If you work in a support staff role, expect to work more than a financial advisor for much less pay and much more work. "
Morgan Stanley,Associate,5,Great place to work. Management fair and supportive. Colleagues teamwork oriented. Firm culture solid all around with 360 reviews and good market compensation.
Morgan Stanley,Financial Analyst,2,"Re/Imagine Collaboration and Sustainability through old school grit and new world ideas is truly just a play on words and a great form of control. Have employees believe their being catered to and that they're comfortable in what appears to be a bee colony environment. All the employees are practically on top of each other.At the end of the day, these poor souls are racing to the door. I've witnessed people crying, people yelling out their frustrations and taking it out on other people for no reason. Don't let the amenities fool you into thinking that this is for your benefit. No amount of meeting areas for you to have chit-chats with clients or collogues is going to change the fact that nothing is private.There's also the Morgan Gives Back... For all the things that Morgan takes, it doesn't give back in equal measure. Every day, food is wasted during catering, during lunch in their newly designed food hall and during the evening rush for food deliveries. Further, Uber or Lyft car services are used on the regular instead of mass transit. So, them giving back to the environment and community with food drives and growing plants is just to give the appearance of whatever their trying to convey.In writing this, I hope that anyone who's currently working their reads this and observes their atmosphere and asks the right questions. To perhaps actually recalibrate this ""Re/Imagined Collaborative work environment. Because in the end, when you change the way, you look at things, the things you look at change."
Morgan Stanley,Managing Director,5,Great firm and culture.  Employees are constantly being challenged to do their best work on behalf of clients.  Definitely an intense environment and not for everyone.  Work / Life balance is tough.
Morgan Stanley,Business Unit Support Specialist,5,"I have learnt how to tackle urgent incidents and demanding users, there are a lot of old software to learn in troubleshoot. I work place is quite clean and secure."
Morgan Stanley,Virtual Engagement Associate,5,"It was a good role, but it could get repetitive over time. You could potentially meet some great FAs but you have to be open to dealing with many different personalities."
Morgan Stanley,"Vice President, Finance",3,"Everything depends on who you know and office politics especially the higher you try to rise.  This also depends on your manager.  If you have a difficult one, you need to move.  Things are also dependent on role and department.  Speaking for Finance in NY, most junior roles are sent overseas, promotions are difficult since they are now also sending more senior roles overseas.  Compensation is poor and you always get ""it was a bad year"" during comp conversations even when the Firm's revenue is skyrocketing.  Your comp will stagnate starting your 3rd year + .  Promotions are way too difficult, you have to work way overtime to participate in networking events and run networking events in order to get your name out there to get  promoted.  Promotions not based on your actual work contribution.  People are good, generally nice.  Lots of social activities, maybe too much.  Company monitors your ""in office days"" very closely, they also penalize you if you are not coming in the required days even though we spend all day on Zoom meetings with overseas teams.  Too many meetings.  "
Morgan Stanley,Help Desk Technician,5,"Great work place and the co workers here were always will to help you out if you have a question.They typically offered overtime a lot as well, which is nice"
Morgan Stanley,Client Service Associate,4,"Great experience and various growth opportunities for someone new in the industry. Pay is average, no parking included, back office could of been better"
Morgan Stanley,"Director, Internal Audit",5,Perfect place for professional development. Gives you opportunities and recognizes talent. Can go up the ladder quickly if you perform well. IT is one of the best investment banks.
Morgan Stanley,Marketing Associate,1,"I worked there for a year but it wasn't fun at all. People are rude, mean, and very pretentious. Certain people have the control and they like it that way. They say they hire you to change processes and make improvements but if you even try, that's the END of all."
Morgan Stanley,Registered Service Associate,5,"Great place to work with amazing culture. There is room for advancement once you become fully registered, Series 7 and 66. Everyone is mostly friendly and easy to work with."
Morgan Stanley,Financial Advisor,4,Was an FAA for a year at morgan Stanley. It was a great place to learn the ins and outs of the stock market and obtain securities licenses. The training and development is there for those that want it. 
Morgan Stanley,Digital VEA,4,"Overall, the digital VEA program is a good place to begin a career in finance. The people are great to work with (both advisors and colleagues). My biggest complaint is that upper management seems detached from the day to day. "
Morgan Stanley,VEA,5,good for getting licensed and if u want to be an FA. direct managers good upper management are complete morons though so it makes it so you spend way more time justifying your job than doing it
Morgan Stanley,Associate,1,"Good company  but politics is part of office environment. Location is good to commute daily, increment is low generally. Cafeteria and pantry is good."
Morgan Stanley,Service Associate,4,"If unlicensed, this role is pretty entry-level. There is room to grow if you obtain your securities licenses. Having your licenses allows you more opportunities to work directly with brokers and/ or earn bonuses. "
Morgan Stanley,Portfolio & Financial Planning Associate,3,What is the best part of working at the company?stability and good reputationsWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?the financial advisors are given free reign to do whatever they wantWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?very cut throat and not cooaperativeWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?cater to the clients and meet sales goals meetings compliance continuing education trades
Morgan Stanley,Personal Relationship Manager ,3,Call center; fast paced and must upscale during calls. Great place to start finance career; will pay for S7 and S66 exams. Not much upside growth potential. 
Morgan Stanley,Office Service Associate,1,I would have to say working at this company has been the worst experience in my career. The only way you would advance is by brown nosing there’s no room for growth. There is very poor management leadership in the Baltimore locations.
Morgan Stanley,Managing Director,5,A company filled with highly intelligent people who care about their clients. Worked there for 21 years.  Would highly recommend to any one.  The best place to start a career.
Morgan Stanley,Fire Guard,2,"My experience with Morgan Stanley so far is unpleasant. The atmosphere is tense and I've observed things that can place people in danger.  Currently, there's changes being made to the security personnel that could pose a threat. Allied Universal is placing former PD in the lobby that are often times too busy conversating with each other, looking at their phones and walking off post to be bothered with doing there jobs. The management is questionable and lacking structure."
Morgan Stanley,Financial Services Representative,4,"While the job is still good, there was a noticeable change in culture after Morgan Stanley acquired E*TRADE. I would recommend the leadership at Morgan Stanley continue to work with the E*TRADE leaders."
Morgan Stanley,Account Manager Associate,4,"Help customers navigate the system, respond with accuracy all the requests. Finance is a training process for the rest of your employment. If you love to learn, this is a great  place to be"
Morgan Stanley,Information Security Analyst,4,"Plenty of technology to work on, but a lot of old in-house products which you have to use. Managers can be a bit of a mixed bag and teams are organised to their whim"
Morgan Stanley,Director of Compliance,4,"You are valued and the benefits are amazing, they have great work life balance. Culture is great depending on your management, compensation is on the lower end "
Morgan Stanley,Registered Associate,1,Branches are chronically understaffed and MS refuses to hire more people.  Managers don’t care how overworked the operation or support professionals are.  As a registered associate you can plan on covering 8 lower producing brokers at a time if you are not a member of a large successful team.  Managers expect you to lie on your timesheet – they want everything to get done but will write you up if you put in overtime without pre-approval 
Morgan Stanley,Financial Advisor,4,What is the best part of working there? The people were very friendly and helpful. It was a good place to work and I learned a lot.  The training could have been a little better.
Morgan Stanley,Service Associate,3,Good company with good pay and benefits but the culture of the office could be difficult working with different personalities. Once they get to know you some they warm up but not very welcoming.
Morgan Stanley,Software Developer Intern,4,"The beginning of my role was great, there was very flexible working hours and you didn't need to go into the office. However, decisions from the upper levels started to decrease the quality of life features that were making us work better by forcing us to go back in an tracking who was in and out. Lots of opportunities to learn new skills though."
Morgan Stanley,Complex Administrator,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The day I quit was the best part of the job. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The demands expected. Their motto was “do more with less staff”, “operate lean”. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very stressful, and depending on your supervisor, it can be toxic. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Squeezing 12 hours of work into an 8 hour day. And still not getting everything done."
Morgan Stanley,Financial Analyst,5,"Great culture, specially for the Calgary office, inherited from Solium Capital legacy teams. Highly capable and energetic people you ever work with in your career. "
Morgan Stanley,Business Analyst,5,Great company with lots of opportunities. Difficult to get promoted. Good technology and systems. Great management. Good team players. Great projects.
Morgan Stanley,Senior Relationship Manager,4,The lack of communication from the top of the firm and the nepotism in terms of hiring is not good. The pay and benefits are above average.    It can be a good place to work. 
Morgan Stanley,HR Assistant,4,There were over 3000 employees in Hong Kong. The role was really specialized and not generalized. Benefits were really good though comparing to the market.
Morgan Stanley,Consultant,1,Was not the right opportunity for me. Could not agree on the right way to build a business. MS focused more on churn rather than building relationships and this was a constant source of friction. 
Morgan Stanley,Senior Java Developer,5,"It is very good place to work with , good pay and nice work life . They pay you on time . Work location is good . Fun place . I would rate as 5 star as per my view "
Morgan Stanley,Service Associate,4,"If unlicensed, this role is pretty entry-level. There is room to grow if you obtain your securities licenses. Having your licenses allows you more opportunities to work directly with brokers and/ or earn bonuses. "
Morgan Stanley,Senior Client Service Associate,4,The workload is higher than competitors but pays better. Workplace culture depends on the location and team you work with. The benefits are great. It is not easy to move away from this role within the firm. 
Morgan Stanley,Sales Management,5,Open minded multicultural work place. Support diversity and work life balance. Best workplace I have been working with so far. Most people are friendly and supportive. Clear expectation and good communication across senior level. 
Morgan Stanley,Relationship Manager,2,"Days are filled answering the same question/scenarios. Management and systems are surprisingly antiquated. Clients, advisors and bankers are unreasonable; escalation culture. The firm loves to use the “triage” as a buzzword, displaying  a callous outlook on actual emergencies.  A lot of talking heads and egos - but with not a lot of value add or hands on experience. "
Morgan Stanley,Registered Client Service Associate,5,Morgan Stanley as a whole is a great company to work for with excellent benefits. Focus on upward mobility has really improved in the last few years. Cutting-edge technology and tools. 
Morgan Stanley,Senior Registered Client Service Associate,3,"Your compensation is low to start with for the industry and greatly depends on the ""generosity"" of the financial advisors that you support.   You have to go to them and ask for them to share their commission.   Your manager will not participate in this process other than helping the FAs fill out a form. Your compensation therefore can vary widely from person to person for the exact same job depending on how much revenue share your FA will give you.  Otherwise you get a 1-2% salary increase for a year of work while being told that you are lucky to have gotten anything as there was thought of ZERO salary increase.   "
Morgan Stanley,Associate,4,Firm has strong work ethics and is employee centric. Provide support for career growth and has flexible work life balance. Provides with various trainings and opportunities for the employee and promotes open discussions with senior managers.
Morgan Stanley,Financial Advisor,4,"Advisors and support staff are very professional and very supportive.  Everyone is willing to help and offer advice.  Laid-back atmosphere, but also professional and driven."
Morgan Stanley,Analyst,4,Good Higher Management and good culture. Good Learning and development. Job security is better than other IBs.Good culture and policies. 4 Month paternity leave  for men.
Morgan Stanley,Investment Banking Analyst,5,I really enjoyed my time at Morgan Stanley and learned more than I could have possibly imagined in 2 years! I am grateful for all the mentorship and advice i received in my time and look forward to staying connected with to my colleagues in the future
Morgan Stanley,"Implementation Specialist, Special Projects and Implementation",3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Relationship with co-workers. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?I don't know how it works now, but when I was employed at Shareworks the pay was extremely low for the kind of work we were doing.  It was a bit of a kick in the gut when I found out that new hires were making an average of $5,000 more in annual salary than I was making.  Moving to a higher paying job within the company didn't help that.  Internal moves were still underpaid while external hires were paid much more.  You would think a company would value the experience that current employees bring, but it seems that those without company experience were valued more.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Though the company talked the talk about how valuable their employees were, they didn't follow through with any kind of evidence of that.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Long, stressful hours with lack of support and blame if mistakes were made."
Morgan Stanley,Client Associate,5,The company lets you work from home 1-2 a week and a total of 90 days a year. Good culture but ultimately depends on the team you end up working for. 
Morgan Stanley,Customer Service Representative,5,"You learn a lot in this role speaking to customers about their trades, brokerage accounts, and retirements. But the company is not organized and lacks communication.  They will do a shift bid and you will pick the shift you want, but then they will give you the total opposite with no other choices. I wanted to work 7am-4pm and I was given 3pm-12am. If I wanted to work those hours I would bartend. Not to mention going into office 3 days a week. The office is another animal as they cut the A/C off after the main people leave. Half of the lights shut off and your stuck in a sweaty dark office until midnight 3 nights a week. Not worth it, but I am learning a lot "
Morgan Stanley,Associate developer,2,"It’s depends on which team you are working with, you can have a great team or work in a very toxic environment. It’s really matter that your manager be at firm for long time to know the culture and system and help you to build your career.The salary is not good but the benefit is great. "
Morgan Stanley,Executive Assistant ,3,Pay scale on the lower end for level of EA. And I did not get a raise in my last 3 years + no bonus.Work/life balance was good.Not flexible in terms of hybrid/remote work.Depends on the banker you get - mine started off fine and became a  micromanaging nightmare.Managers keep things close to the chest to the detriment of their staff.
Morgan Stanley,Field Service Specialist,5,Opportunity of advancementWork life balance Amazing benefits Great Culture Working for Morgan Stanley you really get what you put in. They will promote you based on your actual performance and not based on seniority 
Morgan Stanley,Banker,4,"Working as a banker at this institution has been a fulfilling and enriching experience. The company provides a supportive environment for professional growth and development. The management team values employee input and actively seeks ways to enhance our skills and expertise.The job itself offers a diverse range of responsibilities, from assisting customers with their financial needs to analyzing market trends and making informed recommendations. The collaborative atmosphere fosters teamwork, making it easy to collaborate with colleagues to achieve our common goals.Additionally, the compensation and benefits package is competitive, reflecting the company's commitment to rewarding employees for their hard work and dedication."
Morgan Stanley,FAA,5,"MS is a fantastic place to work as a financial advisor and most offices are focused on teaming which if done right is extremely beneficial. Very happy with the benefits although, as a financial advisor associate after year 1, your income phases out which because most people are still building their business, they do take a hit. "
Morgan Stanley,Participant Relationship Manager,2,Love the volunteer opportunities. Compensation is not fair. Promotion is not fair. There’s no transparency on any aspect of the job. I work at the call center and you don’t have discretion over any decisions 
Morgan Stanley,Data Visualization Intern,4,The manager for my team gave me useful tasks to visualize data within our department.Our team used Tableau to visualize data in different ways. I was able to go to a conference with Tableau developers to learn more about how to use the software.
Morgan Stanley,Account Associate,1,Morgan Stanley as a whole is a good company but this location the MSVA was a nightmare. Stay away if you can. Leadership there did not care about you at all and treated employees like numbers. 
Morgan Stanley,Service Associate,4,"If unlicensed, this role is pretty entry-level. There is room to grow if you obtain your securities licenses. Having your licenses allows you more opportunities to work directly with brokers and/ or earn bonuses. "
Morgan Stanley,Associate,5,"It's a lot of hard work upfront, but the pay is fair (not great). In the end, it's a great ace to start. I probably wouldn't be here for a long time, but it's a good place to jump into a career."
Morgan Stanley,Vice President,3,"Good internal mobility rulesProvides recognition when achievements are madeDepending on amount of collaboration required, it may be difficult to get things done"
Morgan Stanley,SVP,5,"Worked here for about six years never really had a complaint left for another job opportunity helped relocate me to a different state. One requested excellent wealth management solutions. You have to be willing to build a business and if you are, you can be very successful."
Morgan Stanley,Consultant,5,They provided excellent training. It was a great place to start my research career. Management was understanding and very helpful. I would have stayed longer if there were more opportunities for advancement.
Morgan Stanley,Finance Associate,4,I have worked at MS for 4 years and do love the culture and the people.  I have enjoyed my time at MS as they allow a lot of extra things like working within networks/committees. They also encourage volunteering especially for global volunteer month.  
Morgan Stanley,Risk Associate,4,"friendly environment, professional management, average compensation package, a lot of opportunities in terms of mobility and improvement.bad work life balance"
Morgan Stanley,Poor working culture,3,"Good company to have on CV and good experience . Good benefits. Not a great place to work has really gone downhill in the last few years. A lot of old style traditional leadership + micromanagers, like a dictatorship no room for feedback or improvements. Very strict on flexibility. Pay rises have stalled. Feels understaffed and under resourced "
Morgan Stanley,Office cleaner,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Thr building is new and easy to cleanWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?There is high staff turnover due to poor managementWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?The company is the best, the building employs cultured people, but the manager of the cleaners is not good,petty and with OCD, creates tension and irritations What is a typical day like for you at the company?Normal, the people working hard"
Morgan Stanley,Financial Advisor,1,i liked my branch a lot. the other advisors were honest and helpful.  I learned a lot.  Regulation and compliance took up a lot of time. Felt I helped people.
Morgan Stanley,Associate,3,"         I worked in the back-office as Bank Operations Associate. It was a monotonous, computer-heavy job that I eventually grew to hate, but that is the nature of Operations. The company overall  paid ok for the region (though bonuses were paltry), had good benefits, and had good work-life-balance. There are some nice affinity groups and clubs to join at the firm and they often break up the day with fun games etc.         One major positive is that there is no cutthroat or overbearing culture like some other banks, so you get to just do your work and go your way---which was awesome. Internal mobility is well-supported at the firm. Promotion can be a bit tricky with favoritism definitely at play, so if that is your goal you have to get close to the right people and have them in your corner. Also know that despite the laid-back culture, people are making their career moves silently, just as people are also being evaluated quietly and 'underperformers' do get cut unexpectedly and swiftly.          Overall this was a good place to work because of the people, the relaxed firm culture and the great resume booster. The parts that sucked are not entirely unique to the firm itself."
Morgan Stanley,Sr. Underwriter,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The culture and flexibility and work life balance What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Month end and monthly time and OTWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?The culture is very diverse and welcoming What is a typical day like for you at the company?Reviewing and underwriting loan for approval
Morgan Stanley,Associate,5,Extremely smart coworkers and tons of benefits. Pay is reasonable if you live in Balti. Finance department has “Flex Time” which lets you take off some time to do outside if work activities. 
Morgan Stanley,Executive Director,4,They’re starting to care more about employee concerns and well being. Benefits are getting better and feel like they’re probably among the top in the industry. 
Morgan Stanley,Field Trainer,3,"Overall positive environment. Work hours can be a lot at times, but this is the case anywhere. Young people, females, and people of color are treated well and provided the opportunity to advance. "
Morgan Stanley,Customer Service Representative,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?People Free coffee and hot chocolate,  food trucks 3 days a week. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Speaking to branches..they need to have more than one training class , there are so many things to learn in  a 6 week training before you're put to work talking calls..What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great working environment they really care about peopleWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Taking 40 to 50 phone calls .my worst calls are speaking to branches about wires and Fts forms. I don't understand yet. :)"
Morgan Stanley,Associate,4,"Good benefits, ample PTO/Sick Time/Holidays, nice work/life balance and overall good company culture. Still a big corporate financial firm so don't expect to get any kind of substantial raise year over year. As like with any other place, the team can make/break your experience. "
Morgan Stanley,Client Service Representative,2,2/5 it’s a call center job.. Good for out of college but with experience not worth the hassle and development. Don’t recommend if you just want to take calls all day 
Morgan Stanley,Senior Manager,4,"Depends on how your team is setup. There is some discrimination between officers and non-officers but if you can live through that, it's okay. There is good work available. "
Morgan Stanley,VP,2,"Pay below market. Good brand though. Raises are horrendous. But my team is great, so team-dependent. No effort to retain employees. Many people leave "
Morgan Stanley,Mortgage Consultant,5,"Unfortunately, the Private Bank went through a series of lay-offs and i was a part of the 2nd wave as I was only with the bank for about 2 years and they did the right thing by keeping those that had been with the bank for longer periods of time (to minimize the severance package costs and to reciprocate loyalty) The  loyalty individuals included in the 3 lay off waves were 100% based on length of time employed with the bank.  I respect that.  In regards to the company culture, I would say that just like any other very large corporate national employer that everything goes according to regulation and best practices from the corporate level downward.  Of course, those that have worked for large corporations know that each individual division tends to have a separate culture either b/c of acquisitions of smaller companies that are still fully intact employee-wise OR by way of the mentality of upperf management within each division as those at the top tend to bring in people they have worked with in the past and once again that culture could follow a similar atmosphere to a previous work environment.The web-based systems are adequate, and Morgan Stanley is always updating and will take recommendations which is a plus.Pay and benefits are top notch compared to other similar employers.  I would say the benefits would be hard to surpass with all of the extras you can find on the company HR/Benefits website.  The extras more than make up for a slightly lower comp package with someone else."
Wells Fargo,Bank Teller,5,I learned a great deal . I had never taken zoom classes but everyone at Wells Fargo main branch helped me and made my training a very good experience.  I later enrolled in online classes atWGU due to the experience and confidence that my coworkers had given me.
Wells Fargo,Phone Banker I,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Hybrid position once you are trainedWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Night shift and also learning the job fullyWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?They have a very good trading system in placeWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Inbound calls usually replacing credit cards lost or stolen . Questions customers may have with their statements. Process fraud claims
Wells Fargo,Teller,5,"It was a goo job and the benefits are a nice bonus.  If your looking for a way to get to know the community better, working in Flagstaff lets you get a great feel for the town! "
Wells Fargo,Analyst,3,"Some areas are ok, some are high stress. The culture can be toxic and the leadership is not great. But it's a huge organization with lots of opportunity."
Wells Fargo,Associate Corporate Security Guard,3,"One of the most unique security jobs I've held, seeing as it's a secure indoor environment; I used to tell people I was like that security guard from the ""Men in Black"" movies, because our location didn't have any signage (and my manager did NOT want me to disclose to anyone about the actual address of the site).  No filling out (generally useless) DARs but we had to maintain several other logs, some electronic, others on paper.Downtown LA location so the commute was always a challenge.  Add to that the constantly changing schedule where we can start either early (yes, zero-dark-30 early) or late night (yes, like the late late show) so that played havoc on your circadian rhythm as well as life balance/responsibilities.  Back in the day we had to work Sundays (so you'd rarely have two consecutive days off) but the site changed their operations so we had two consecutive days off.Medical, dental, 401k with 6% match, and PTO that you *had* to take (they wouldn't let you cash it out unless you resigned or terminated) which was nice.  Not so nice was the schedule, lip service from upper management and bringing things to their attention that would never change, no advancement opportunities (unless you transitioned into a different role in another department) and a draconian (yes, not joking) attendance and punctuation policy where one minute late is late...but we'd have people call off at the last minute and if they had a PTO balance, it was fine.Rather stressful because making minor mistakes on paperwork (especially sign in sheets where visitors wouldn't sign in correctly and - more..."
Wells Fargo,Escalations Representative,3,"Wells Fago is laying off ALL office work employees and moving this type of work out of state and out of the country so it no longer matters. If you live in another state Where Wells Fargo is going to continue having this type of work, I highly recommend it."
Wells Fargo,Bank Teller,3,The customers for my location are fairly great! When I started working here everything was great but they slowly started to reduce the amount of staff. Now we are short staffed and get fussed out for things we can’t control. Like wait times but we only have 2 tellers on average. The hardest part is trying to manage all the customers and give them the time needed for their transactions when we are so short staffed. I love what I do but… I don’t feel appreciated for the effort I put in. I feel drained everyday and it causes me stress. I work all day and only get lunch and can barely take bathroom breaks cause we have no staff. 
Wells Fargo,Relationship Associate,5,Started in 2012. I love everything about my job. Easy. Flexible. I’m happy to stay at this job with ease. There are a lot of changes just like any other bank but as long as you can keep up with change you’ll be fine.
Wells Fargo,Researcher,5,"We work hard with enough time for engagements. Enough leave credits to relax and enjoy extended time with family. Good Hamao coverage, leaders you can look up to and develop you."
Wells Fargo,Customer Service Associate/Banker,1,"Working in phone banking has been an awful experience. The calls are back to back all day long, and the customers treat you horribly. Time off requests are almost always instantly denied, and it’s very difficult to move up within the company. I think the most ridiculous thing about this company is the fact they require a doctors note and a referral to accommodations through HR if you have to go to the bathroom more than two times during your shift. It’s one thing if somebody is spending longer than a few minutes in the bathroom, but this includes everyone who is just trying to make a quick trip to the bathroom during their shift. HR will also tell you that “for every minute you spend in the bathroom, you have to stay that much longer after your clock-out time.” Absolutely not. The micromanagement here is way too much. "
Wells Fargo,Branch Manager,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits, hours, allowance for ptoWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Short staffing, nps scores held against us for things out of our controlWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Too much emphasis on DEI. So tiresome hearing about the lgbtq agenda. What is a typical day like for you at the company?All customer service for the most part."
Wells Fargo,Phone Banker,3,I had a pretty decent time at Wells Fargo. It was alright pay at the time i started in 2020. I Left in 2022 because the Job was by far the most boring job I've ever had. The Management did not actually take calls or know how to help Phone Bankers with calls which was kinda lame. Everyone had a different answer for everything. 
Wells Fargo,Senior Business Execution Consultant,2,"They DISPLACED me as a remote worker but didn't allow an option for me to return to or move to a hub. While remote, I had a new manager each year. Job duties changed the 20 months with a new policy and no one liked it but I managed. The title is a catch all Expect plenty of lateral moves. Always pay attention to SALARY rank/coding regardless of job title. They have limits on moving on to other jobs like it can't be more than 2 steps above your current rank/coding. 2 years contracting and hired direct then worked 4.5 more years. This past year included illness and FMLA leave. I returned from FMLA and was displaced 6 months later before undergoing surgery and chemotherapy which my newest manager was completely informed about since it was on the team calendar for PTO. The PTO was required before short term disability makes a payment. Ce la vie. "
Wells Fargo,Fraud Specialist,5,My whole stay in this company was superb. I love how professional all my colleagues. What I love most in this company is their leaders. They will really help and guide you to grow. They will guide you to the career path you want. 
Wells Fargo,Equipment Operator,3,The machines are very outdated as well as a few of the processes. Management is friendly but annual raises are 2% or less no matter how well one performs. The hours are very long (10+ hour days). 
Wells Fargo,HR,3,"Over the last ten years, regulatory problems have occurred. While they are trying to fix problems, risk problems always appear.  If you don't live in certain cities (Hubs), you will eventually be laid off.  "
Wells Fargo,Account Resolution Specialist,4,"My experience in Auto Collections wasn't great. No room for growth, made to feel like a robot on the dialer, hounding us over call times, etc. I think if I had been in a different department or even had the chance to grow and move to another department my experience would have been different. "
Wells Fargo,Service Manager 2,5,"I worked here for 10 years. I had great leaders who trained me and cared about my success. Very supportive and inclusion culture. It was a great place to learn, grow and build a solid foundation. "
Wells Fargo,Associate Customer Service Representative,4,I love working here. Great job with a lot of opportunities. Could be more room for hybrid schedule but I'm not complaining. Pay is great coming in and you aren't overworked 
Wells Fargo,Fraud and Claims Associate,2,"The culture is horrible. The job metrics are out of line and management is so far out of touch with workers that poor policies cause constant turnover. If you get a rating less than 100% someone is calling you to ""coach"" you on it. No one ever calls to say nice job. You only hear from management when something is wrong. The atmosphere breeds contempt and the pay doesn't match what other banks pay. WF moves at a snails pace in addressing workplace issues like worker pay and job dissatisfaction. This place screams Union Please. "
Wells Fargo,Ejecutivo Financiero (Operaciones Bancarias para Pequeñas Empresas),5,"What is the best thing to work in the company? My work team was unique.We started the customer service with small businesses in San Antonio.The leaders, especially Lesly Villareal is highly trained and excellent person.I want to work there. What is the most stressful of working in the company? Some calls can be a bit complex, but there is always support from supervisors, how is the environment and culture of work in the company? The training is constant,And they have the objective that employees access professional growth.The advisors are always attentive to the needs of their employees.Excellent work atmosphere How is a typical day for you in the company? In the area that I had the opportunity to work, I received calls throughout the day.Depending on the complexity of each call was the solution we had to offer to customers.The schedule was fair, it began exactly and ended at the right time.Overtime were paid when necessary"
Wells Fargo,Bank Teller,5,I learned a great deal . I had never taken zoom classes but everyone at Wells Fargo main branch helped me and made my training a very good experience.  I later enrolled in online classes atWGU due to the experience and confidence that my coworkers had given me.
Wells Fargo,Senior Fraud Representative,2,Favoritism occurs among some managers and employees. HR is very nice and helpful. Employees are nice. Managers are quick to terminate employees by writeups but I think it backfires on the company.
Wells Fargo,Human Resources Specialist,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Remote contract was excellent. Components weee shipped to my home. I enjoy the Wells Fargo community.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Waiting for the components to arrive in good condition.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very professional and cordial.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Sign in, check schedules for workload. Read all instructions and compliance information.  Receive daily assignments from leads. Begin calling and receiving calls from employees of the company for benefit updates and confirmation of coverage."
Wells Fargo,Teller,2,"WF is clearly trying to save money wherever they can by pushing customers to do everything online and reducing branch staff to a minimum. The consequence is that you are often overwhelmed on the teller line, and a large part of your job is referring people to our app/online i.e. training your robot replacement."
Wells Fargo,"Sunnyside, OR",1,Unorganized business practices. The corporate doesn’t care about its employees. The branch manager legit saw me getting cussed out by a customer and chose to not do anything about it. Stay away from this employer as far as possible.
Wells Fargo,Commercial Banking Intern,4,The work that I was asked to do was interesting but repetitive. Wells Fargo does a good job of creating company branding and implementing that throughout the company.
Wells Fargo,Loan Verification Analyst,3,What is the best part of working at the company?The cafeteria and how close it was to Walmart .What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Never knowing if your position was up on the chopping block. Not getting straight answers. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful stressful stressful. What is a typical day like for you at the company?unsure. Didn't know if you would come in and they tell you that your team has been let go or if you will get hit with more work than ONE person can handle.
Wells Fargo,Supervisory Control Specialist,5,Benefits are great and the people are generally nice to work with. Management can be a little all over the place depending on the department you work in though. 
Wells Fargo,Mortgage Loan Officer,1,"Poor management. I was assigned a bank branch, was not told it was assigned to me and my mentor took the branch and all of the leads.  When I confronted the branch manager he could have cared less.  "
Wells Fargo,Account Resolution Specialist III,5,"Great people. The pay is decent. Benefits are awesome. When it comes to mangement, they love to micromanage unfortunately. I spent my last 16 years there and leaving the company was bittersweet. "
Wells Fargo,Machine Operator,4,What is the best part of working at the company?The pay and benefits is the best part about working at Wells Fargo What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The people that run things there don't know how to run things.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is like a drama TV showWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Doing my work and going on home
Wells Fargo,Home Preservation Specialist,4,"Very supportive and good managers. I never really felt overwhelmed with the workload. However, when I left they had me do a bunch of work so they could put together a ""handbook"" for people that were leaving. It was not acceptable."
Wells Fargo,Client Associate,3,Not a great environment at my specific location.  No branch manager to control the toxic atmosphere.  Corporate isn’t horrible but locally nothing is taken care of.  
Wells Fargo,Teller,4,"This job was more demanding then expected. While we were well staffed, the workload is intense and it never got easier. Coworkers were supportive but the endless transactions felt draining."
Wells Fargo,Loan Examination Associate,3,"Very easy job, managers were fine. Pay is not competitive with the current market. Benefits are good. Office culture was professional but relaxed.     "
Wells Fargo,Teller,5,Not a bad place to work especially if you’re in school or just want to make a few extra money. The supervisors are going to help you understand the process of making your time good
Wells Fargo,Lead Compliance Officer,3,"I’ve worked here for over 17 years. My direct leaders have always been amazing, but the company has changed and the overall culture isn’t what it used to be. It started to feel like Wells Fargo doesn’t really care about their employees, even though my direct leaders were always amazing. "
Wells Fargo,Graphic Designer,1,"Hard to have good morale with so many company scandals. Very little advancement, they would rather hire from outside than promote from within. Nice co-workers but the management provides little support or mentoring. "
Wells Fargo,Premier Banker,3,"Great to be an employee, lots of rules and procedures you have to follow to a tee or you get errors that count against you. Tough demanding job but pipeline potential"
Wells Fargo,Too afraid to disclose,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Remote work, which is now changed to part time remote work.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Little to no training, on tasks no one could figure out on their own.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Management is smiles...until they decide you aren't good enough and without any help or development. Start to document lies ( I called them on it and HR, too) and then lay you off.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Never know ..projects change with the wind."
Wells Fargo,Sr. Software Engineer,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Got to work on new technologies. Work life balance is good. Quite nice experience.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Nothing as such.

You are free to switch project and role after 1 year.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I am SSE , my day is like with Daiy standup. And working on own tasks. Few meetings for planning work some days not every day."
Wells Fargo,Bank Teller,5,I learned a great deal . I had never taken zoom classes but everyone at Wells Fargo main branch helped me and made my training a very good experience.  I later enrolled in online classes atWGU due to the experience and confidence that my coworkers had given me.
Wells Fargo,Lead Digital Product Manager,3,"I was hired by and worked for an excellent, personable, engaging manager who is well-liked. Others on the team were happy to have transferred in from much worse managers. Learned a lot about Agile Methodology, but there are still massive internal struggles in the organization to adapt to changes. Lines of business feel very siloed still.The company has a lot to learn about valuing employees. They talk about caring about employees and work-life balance, and yet, they demand in-office time, forcing people to waste hours and gas commuting and to pay for expensive parking when many will only sit in a cubicle, not even knowing the people around them and joining meetings on the computer exactly like they'd do at home. But when employees tell them how much better their lives are with the flexibility of working from home when they don't have in-person meetings, we'll the top leaders will just end up telling you to comply or else.They have been laying off so many employees these past couple of years. It seems they're targeting any that may have been listed as Remote, even if it was the company that put them in a remote category. No opportunity to change back from remote to an office to protect your job. Good performers with 17 years there just dropped in an instant, likely because they may have been assigned as Remote by the company. "
Wells Fargo,Software Engineer,5,"Wellsfargo, was a good place to work allows for great learning opportunities. Minimal meetings and gives freedom to implement your ideas and encourages new processes"
Wells Fargo,Phone Banker,1,They do not treat people fairlyYou will get mistreated There is alot of favorism You will NOT GROW unless you became best friends with managament Overall very inhumane placeWill get pointed fingers for those who have a medical history
Wells Fargo,Loan Operations Specialist,1,"closing branches and offices in USA to open offices in India and Philippines.  so difficult seeing colleagues, family and friends loose their livelihood."
Wells Fargo,Personal Banker,5,"Working at Wells Fargo was an excellent experience where I had the opportunity to learn everything about money—how financing works, the ins and outs of investments, and what it takes to achieve sales success. It wasn’t just a job; it was a comprehensive education in financial services that greatly benefited both my personal finances and career.The company pushes you to excel, especially when it comes to sales, so you definitely develop a strong work ethic and a deep understanding of what it takes to succeed in a competitive environment. Overall, I gained invaluable knowledge and skills that have prepared me for future growth.If you're looking for a place to grow professionally and learn about the world of finance, Wells Fargo is a great place to start"
Wells Fargo,CPG Intern,5,"I interned there in summer of 23. Great program very relaxed. If you like a great environment where time schedules are months out, low stress, great job. "
Wells Fargo,Loan Sales Document Specialist,3,empty promises and little backing or opportunity for growthhired through contractors was treated less than an employee Managment doesn't understand their job let alone your jobWells Fargo - where the stories you hear are true 
Wells Fargo,Registered Client Associate,4,Leadership is good. From my experience they assist in what career path you’d like to take. However there are not a lot of opportunities to move up. Pay can be better
Wells Fargo,Customer Service Representative,4,Great place to work overall management thinks they are little gods. The culture was not there 3ven though headquarters fought to make it a great place to work.
Wells Fargo,Support Specialist,4,"Wells Fargo offers a comprehensive set of benefits, including a stock purchase plan, discounts on financial products and home mortgages, and programs to support work-life balance"
Wells Fargo,Wells Fargo ,5,"Great pay , good management . Opportunities to advanced , pay increase is great , not a bad work environment, great people to work with , hr is good with handling any accommodations"

Wells Fargo,Customer Service Representative,1,"Employer is a disappointment, to say the least.Do not recommend working  here due to lack of proper management and leadership.Learned a lot but the problem is with management and overall corporation."
Wells Fargo,Personal Banker,4,decent pto amount and rollover policy. the management is considerate if request ahead and does not interfere with business. Although rollover has a limit in years but generous enough to carry over more  days for a longer time off 
Wells Fargo,Senior Mortgage Processor,4,Very good working atmosphere. The mortgage processing department was a very good place to work at. The management and  employees got along well. Would recommend.
Wells Fargo,Customer Success Representative,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Absolutely nothing!! Do not waste your timeWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?EVERYTHING: phone calls, work environment, etcWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic: company does not care about employees"
Wells Fargo,Fraud Specialist,1,Not worth the pay or stress. Training was terrible. Got thrown on the phones without proper navigation of the system and they want to upskill you for no additional pay. The shift sucks. 
Wells Fargo,Senior Premier Banker,3,"Overall good place to work and decent pay. A lot of turnover and management over the last couple years has really affected morale. My particular location was becoming very toxic and stressful, so I left the company. "
Wells Fargo,Analyst,3,Never too stressful very regulated and impersonal. Go get your work done and then go home. Not new or innovative or any personality but your paycheck will show up 
Wells Fargo,Institutional Investment Operations Analyst,1,"Terrible culture, terrible management who are not knowledgable…everyone knowledgable gets lets go….more interested in getting  their “Global Survey” done"

Wells Fargo,HOME PRESERVATION SPECIALIST 2,5,Great place to work departments are flexible and understand life/work balance. There is advancement opportunities and sometimes it is also who you know to be noticed more but overall great experience and great place to work. Recent layoffs though hurt a lot of workers which was only downside
Wells Fargo,Senior Account Resolution Specialist,4,Pay was great compared to similar positions at similar companies but frequent changes of leadership and horrendous attitudes from certain leaders made it unbearable at times
Wells Fargo,Loan Servicing Specialist IIII,3,"Buckle your seat belt and hold on tight. The pay is amazing, but other competitors pay more. There is a great work life balance, however, there are constantly so many changes. Good luck on moving up the corporate ladder has they already know who will fill the position before they post it "
Wells Fargo,Loan Officer,3,The job itself is stressful because of the sales goals. I feel I had to pick sales goals over actually helping people. The coworkers are amazing but it's draining 
Wells Fargo,Home Preservation Specialist (FHA - VA),2,The leadership at Wells Fargo does not care out the employees. Their actions are different than their word. We are over worked and under paid for the responsibility that we have on a daily basis. They expect up to be perfect in a place where perfect does not exist. We are held at a standard that leadership themselves cannot obtain if they did the job. They have unrealistic expectations of their employees 
Wells Fargo,Customer Service Representative II,5,A very fun place to work. Pay wasn’t that good. The job can be stressful at times but managers and coworkers help you a lot. The cafeteria was awesome.
Wells Fargo,"Manager, Work Director, Processer.",2,"not good interment for work in some department. management, has no experience with the Job, so they don't know anything about work.workplace culture: they work as groups, not co-worker."

Wells Fargo,Collector I,1,It was okay typical call center collecting on over-drafted accounts. In the phones for whole shift taking back to back calls must be ready for en t call right after finishing one. 
Wells Fargo,Fraud and Claims Specialist,3,Overall great experience with the company just don’t like call center environment. Didn’t feel like those in position to be resources were reliable.  
Wells Fargo,Teller,3,"The work environment was fantastic, except for the sales portion. We were constantly pushed to meet impractical sales goals for the area of the country we are in. "
Wells Fargo,Associates CSR - Customer Service Representative,2,"Overall the job itself isn't bad.  It is stressful alot of the times. I loved my managers I had, their boss we hardly ever saw.  It is a point based system. So if you get sick or have a family emergency even with proof you can still aquire points and be terminated for things that are out of your control, so becareful with  missing.  I gave some low ratings because I feel as if they are not for the employees when it comes to things like this and getting approval is almost always impossible even with documentation from a physician. "
Wells Fargo,Customer Service Representative,3,"No room for growth, worked from home which was nice, lots of favoritism for certain managers and their team, passed up on a lot of opportunities because the manager in charge would select all of their team"
Wells Fargo,Underwriter,1,Department and manager will determine a lot of your satisfaction. Upper management is typically not great and current CEO doesn't value employees. Constant pressure with layoffs and jobs being sent overseas. Constant scandals and regulatory issues. Future is not bright.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?Working within an Agile environment, SCRUM teams meet daily to achieve goals."
Wells Fargo,Wells Fargo phone banker,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits but management is poor. Very intimidating training tactics and leaders llhave nothing better to do than be listening to calls and criticizing the employees that actually do take the calls What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Every month pressure from supervisor to meet your numbers even when it's something out of your control. Always comes outt as a threat to write you up on one metric and seem to focus on what you are struggling with instead of helping you feel scared to lose your jobWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Not sure it is very diverse no problems thereWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?On the phone except breaks and 30 min lunches
Wells Fargo,Loan Processor,2,Productive and fun place to work it was like a family everyone helped each other out and managers knew nothing when it came time for questions about changes .
Wells Fargo,Bank Teller,5,I learned a great deal . I had never taken zoom classes but everyone at Wells Fargo main branch helped me and made my training a very good experience.  I later enrolled in online classes atWGU due to the experience and confidence that my coworkers had given me.

Wells Fargo,Claims Specialist,3,The claims department was laid off and the roles were absorbed by TX and India. People with 20 + years of experience were displaced. Teams had fun until the looming layoffs made the job stressful.

Wells Fargo,Application Engineer II,4,It was great time to work with Wells Fargo for 20+ years. Nice people and direct management.

Wells Fargo,Information Security Analyst,4,"Pros: Hybrid flexibility, friendly and helpful coworkers, decent benefits.Cons: Typical corporate politics, constantly shifting procedures hindering work, not much movement even with management promises of such."
Wells Fargo,Teller,2,"While I enjoyed my coworkers, the company was very sales driven. You had a minimum to meet each month. I did not like offering an 18-year-old a credit card just because a prompt popped up on my screen.  "
Wells Fargo,Part Time Teller,5,It's not a bad company to work for. Can be very flexible if your going back to school. Everyone is very supportive and willing to help each other out. Only problem is that some branches have staffing issues.
Wells Fargo,Fraud Claims Specialist,4,The leadership was great but the job is the same repetitive call center job.The management seemed to want to help their employees with their work and helped with schedules.
Wells Fargo,Personal Banker,1,"The company had ridiculous sales goals and forced them on you by management. When customers didn’t want something management would push you to push products on the customer and if the customer complained the blame would be on you, "
Wells Fargo,Phone banker,5,"Stressful job, yet all call centers are high stress. You are dealing with peoples money so you will get yelled at quite a bit during overdraft Tuesdays. However the company makes up for the customer phone abuse lol…..excellent benefits, decent pay, chance to grow, lots of added training and great cafeteria! "
Wells Fargo,Customer Service Representative,1,Terrible experience; it's clear management only cares about sales and not the customer or employee.  Employees are micromanaged and given no autonomy to do what is right for the customer.
Wells Fargo,Customer Service Representative,3,"I cannot complain about the salary and benefits. However, as with any work, you need to be tough and face adversaries head on. No time for soft heart."
Wells Fargo,Personal Banker,1,"I had a disability and they put me on the opening and closing team despite them having more than enough employees to be a part of the team. No opportunities for advancement and was mislead into believing that I could get promoted in less than a year during the interview when in reality you had to be there a minimum of 12 months. You could manager approval to to apply for a relative role, I asked and she said they couldn’t due to policy when you could as it mentioned it in the guideline. Almost got injured in the parking lot as well due to their policies, and I had a 5 hour round trip commute. I ended up quitting "
Wells Fargo,Assistant Branch Manager,5,"As Credit Manager, you never have time to get bored, each case is a world and your task is to look for ways to approve your clients as long as you take care of the pocket of the entity and do not cause conflict with the approval or disapproving."
Wells Fargo,Senior Escalation Specialist,5,Great place to work! Supervisors were always willing to listen to your concerns and acted right away to fix anything that needed fixing. Co workers were also great. 
Wells Fargo,Research and Remediation Analyst,4,"I worked for Wells Fargo for 12 years, I had many opportunities for advancement and many learning opportunities. I think it is a great place to start your career or find higher level jobs. The pay was good, and the bonuses were decent, I liked my managers and I got to do a diverse set of jobs and tasks. I would recommend this company to anyone, working in the branch is a good opportunity as well. "

Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier/Customer Service,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Customers were wonderful. I enjoyed interacting.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Asking each customer even though I asked before if they wanted to apply for a Lowe’s credit card.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Relaxed atmosphere .

Lowe's Home Improvement,Sales PSE - Project Specialist Exteriors,2,The prevailing feeling from coworkers is that they were terrified of being fired.  Other employees played games getting coworkers in trouble or terminated in order to climb over their corpses to be promoted.  Very dog eat dog environment.  
Lowe's Home Improvement,Part Time Sales Associate,3,"Its a sales driven industry so if the store location you are working at is not meeting the sales quota, hours will be cut, starting with part time employees first. With that being said if you are full time be prepared to be constantly pressured to drive sales and push products. It does seem like certain part time employees who are favorited over others still get decent hours compared to others. Maybe they help open more credit card accounts or help out the sales specialist better than others, but a couple part timers still earn enough hours for a decent work week, while other part timers wont even get hours for weeks at a time."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Machine Operator,5,productive and fun workplace enjoyed the time there. the managers were flexible and hours werent bad. safety measures were taken very seriously which i appreicated

Lowe's Home Improvement,Warehouse Associate,3,Not a bad company to work for although pay and benefits could be better. The job itself is pretty simple once you get the hang of things. Negative is constant micromanaging going on. Senior management strong armed location and everything changed for the worst overnight. Met lots of good people here.
Lowe's Home Improvement,Head Cashier,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Friendly imvorment great company to work forWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Upper management doesn't know how things work

The pay is quite reasonable What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Trying to get all your required training in on time
Lowe's Home Improvement,Associate,4,"I don't know what areas I be working in Lowes, my hours are cut short, the original department I worked in is paint. I love working in this department, I really learned alot about paint. Now I work in home decor sometimes, or hardware. It's a channel wherever they put me. I just enjoy working there."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Lowes,1,"I worked as a remote agent for this company doing customer service. They pay you only 12 dollars an hour yet expect you to learn this heavy college material with software that kicks you out half the time. If you get kicked out its oh well, you don't get paid for that day. "
Lowe's Home Improvement,Lumber Associate,5,"They welcomed me with smiles and a huge amount of support when I arrived. They were patient with training me and would reassure me of the work I was putting in, miss those days. "

Lowe's Home Improvement,Pro Loader,4,"Main job priority is loading pro customers. Maintaining the stock and cleanliness of the pro canopy is the other half. This generally entails industrial quantities of building materials including but not limited to concrete, plywood, drywall, lumber, flooring, stone, and other materials. I would consider it mandatory to use the powered equipment provided by lowes for this job. My first weeks loading without powered equipment licenses was not feasible. It can be a great environment to learn new skills, specifically powered equipment. I would recommend taking the skills learned here after some time and translating them to a better paying job ultimately. Experiences vary per store. My experience in this location has been overall positive and non stressful, I have a good team in the pro area. Overall good management, no aggressiveness or petty behavior. I would recommend this job as a stepping stone."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Overnight Stocker,2,I often had to lift 100+ lbs by myself had to drive power equipment on little to no sleep management cares little about your well being I'm a disabled veteran that was written up for my disability and HR did nothing after I brought it up to them I wasn't told about any accommodations until I got HR involved this company doesn't care about its employees

Lowe's Home Improvement,Garden Center Associate,2,"Too many cooks in a kitchen. Had 4 managers telling me to do different things too many times. It was a bad experience, and the managers stick to being around the managers, making it so that the associates isolate. "
Lowe's Home Improvement,Kitchen Specialist,3,This is a decent job when you are actually able to do it. Usually you will need to cover other departments or assist customers with unrelated tasks. Management at my location is good but I hear others aren’t run as well.
Lowe's Home Improvement,Associate,5,I enjoy working here a lot. It can be difficult work and isnt the most glamorous. But the supervisors and shift managers really care about their teams.
Lowe's Home Improvement,Manager,5,Great work life balance and competitive pay.  Would recommend working here for advancement opportunities.  Location and culture matter so pick a store that is best for you.

Lowe's Home Improvement,Lows,5,I want to work an it will be my first job an I feel get lows a place of love an work an get the job done so I will work at any time someone call out or some.
Lowe's Home Improvement,Head Cashier,1,"Worse place to work. Managers are the worst at Lowe's. They're lazy vindictive, back stabbing, unsupportive, untrustworthy, the worst I've ever witnessed in my entire life. They don't train you properly. There's favoritism. Coworkers hardly get along, and make working here an absolute nightmare. HR doesn't help, and isn't anonymous as you think so forget asking them for any type of solution. I don't recommend this employer to anyone!"
Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier/Customer Service/Sales Associate,5,"Definitely a good job to start off with and grow from within the company. Would recommend if you need something laid back if you do front end.The hardest part was a team lead that would constantly belittle coworkers and lie on paperwork. The lead would target disabled coworkers which was reported numerous times with no results.The most enjoyable part though was ringing out customers, it's easy and understandable to read the registers and the products. Also the layout of the building is pretty straight forward."
Lowe's Home Improvement,CSA - Customer Service Associate,1,If your a good worker they expect you do everything and everyone else can stand around and talk to one another. I haven’t really learned anything that I didn’t already know.  Management well let’s just say they should all be replaced. The most enjoyable thing is getting paid.. 
Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier,1,I don’t want to type this. i learned nothing but they are all liars and don’t care about the employees. they expect you to work day in and day out and if u want any days off have fun trying to get them. you never get the weekend off. you hey don’t pay you enough for what h have to deal with
Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier/Sales Associate,3,my manager was weird but it wasn’t a horrible place to work. my actual coworkers were pretty chill and there were some workers that went out of their way to make you feel comfortable. 
Lowe's Home Improvement,Sales Associate,3,"Management kinda sucked, one of the managers ended up getting fired, a lot of HR issues, creepy manager making comments about your body, not a lot of support, its made clear to you how easily replaceable you are. As someone that goes the extra mile, your efforts get taken advantage of and barely any recognition. Felt burnt out fairly fast, wasted almost 3 years of my life here but made great friends. "

Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Some Customers are nice. Some Coworkers are nice. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?No hours for PT people. Like you have no bills to pay. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Busy. Culture…, if you are part of the ‘Club’ you can do whatever you want. Never get in trouble. Drink ‘the Kool Aid’ they drink. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy. Busy. Busy. Busy. Busy. Busy. Short hand most of the times. Busy."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Merchandiser/sales Associate/back Up Driver for Delv of Pruducts,5,You can get over worked because others are not as eager to help as you. You fill in for slow workers alot. It didn't matter if they got done or were slow I had to finish their jobs.
Lowe's Home Improvement,Assistant Store Manager,1,There is never enough employees to help out customers and to perform the excessive amount of tasks that need to get done. Store manager is a joke that takes care on non-performing employees and is merely a puppet to the District Manager. Working hard at this store doesn’t pay off at all. 
Lowe's Home Improvement,Plumbing Customer Service Associate ,3,No training at all. Decent pay depending on what you do. No extra pay for power equipment certification or ability to help out in other departments. A bit gossipy 
Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier/Customer Service,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Customers were wonderful. I enjoyed interacting.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Asking each customer even though I asked before if they wanted to apply for a Lowe’s credit card.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Relaxed atmosphere .

Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier,3,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Lowe's, but the management was quite unfair with me personally. I did enjoy working with my coworkers there. They made my experience at Lowe's enjoyable. "
Lowe's Home Improvement,Merchandising Lead,4,Great place to work but pay is not fair. New employees make more than long time workers. The garden center is great and the people are great to work with. Management does not look out for you.
Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier ,1,"Its only worth working there if there are no other options. The pay is low and if you prove competent you will be stuck doing everything as management drives out employees. Opportunities for advancement are limited and merit is less of a concern than ""diversity""."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier/Customer Service,4,"Clock in, do your job, don't take anything to personal. The coworkers tend to get along, everyone is in the same boat. Just don't expect corporate to do you many favors."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Flooring Sales,5,easy job and good people to work with customer are usually nice only problem is schedule is kinda all over the place so gotta be prepared for that....
Lowe's Home Improvement,Floor Hand,3,"Every day is just about the same make sure ""your"" department is clear and taken care of, as long as the tasks that have been assigned to ""you"" if any have been given are complete its chill."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Department Supervisor,3,"The people you work with are great and the company truly cares as much as a large company can. Where they fail is the scheduling. You will have a rotating set of days off and randomly assigned one of three shifts. When the schedule online comes out 2 weeks at a time this makes it basically impossible to plan anything. Also the assistant store managers seem to be mostly incompetent and rely on by the book company level programs to ""better"" the store"
Lowe's Home Improvement,Department Supervisor,3,"Decent place to work, but too many hands in the pot, and unrealistic expectations. Breaking up an efficient team that was great together made no sense to me"
Lowe's Home Improvement,Dept. Supervisor,3,You have to work overtime to make up for the lack of workers. You will always be understaffed and have to work crazy hours to make up for it if you want your department to be looking good.
Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier,1,I got hired on as part time even though my availability is open! The store manager said “you’ll get more hours with more availability” as if I’m not open…. On my first day after training I was alone closing!
Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier/Customer Service,1,Over worked under paidRarely get 15s lunch always late always short staffed management is a joke they pick favorites hours are not worth the amount you get paid
Lowe's Home Improvement,Unloader,2,"not bad, good co workers management could use a sit down talk. the shipping and receiving manager when i was employed at lowes was not good. HR no help"
Lowe's Home Improvement,Sales Associate,4,What is the best part of working at the company?They do their best to keep a family ethic with the company.   I appreciate the safety learning everyday.  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with irrate customers.  The management sticks to customer always right and sometimes there is verbal abuse allowed.  What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Warehouse environment we try to keep it clean and work together.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Down stocking cleaning making pain doing llowes u and checking my mail.
Lowe's Home Improvement,Merchandiser,3,Typical merchandising job. Set hours just no room for advancement . Management could be more helpful in decision making process. Everything is last minute decision 
Lowe's Home Improvement,Hardware Associate,5,"It’s a job not much to say or put it,good enough pay for me I worked for Lowe’s for 2 years had no real complaints,there was mean managers and nasty customers buts that’s life other wise jobs easy and you learn very fast ,I would definitely recommend this job as a first time job "
Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier/Customer Service,5,Great Company We make sure our Customers are happy please Come visit up for all your In home and outdoor needs It’s Guaranteed you will love our Store 
Lowe's Home Improvement,Green Team,3,Poorly ran. Favoritism. Bad scheduling. Decent pay for nothing burger job. The vacation time is much more than most companies so that’s a plus. Good 1st time job don’t have a career here 
Lowe's Home Improvement,Commercial Sales Associate,3,"I worked for Lowe’s for over 20 years but when they decided I was at my ceiling for salary they monitored my every move to fire me with no warning. I made a minor infraction and was fired with no warning or write up. They are known to find reasons to get rid of “older” employees when closing in on retirement age or refusing to take in a management position with long hours, stressful work loads and other unrealistic managerial requirements. "
Lowe's Home Improvement,Plumbing Department,3,Overall its ok. The store managers think they are perfect and know everything.The learning programs were decent.                                                                   
Lowe's Home Improvement,Assistant Store Manager,3,I enjoyed working with some great  people but the hours can be long. Pay is average and the benefits are good. Upward mobility is average as well and future is bright.
Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier/Customer Service,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Customers were wonderful. I enjoyed interacting.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Asking each customer even though I asked before if they wanted to apply for a Lowe’s credit card.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Relaxed atmosphere . Except redundant on asking for credit card application to be submitted. I can understand asking new customers, repeat customers nonsensical.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy atmosphere. Enjoyed the high pace."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Merchandise Sales Associate,2,"Favoritism it huge here, if they realize you are a worker they will over work you due to the favoritism and the slackers get away with it. The schedule is a plus I'm lucky to have a mon-fri position so I get weekends off Management doesn't want to learn from there employees but expect you to follow blindly even if you can provide a more efficient solution."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Order Fulfillment Associate,5,Nice people great works everyone gets along and works hards no complaints always and pleasure to work there customers are great and nothing to change 
Lowe's Home Improvement,Pro Loader,3,It’s retail. Coworkers were generally cool but there are some in management who want to be boss and not lead. I don’t necessarily blame the higher ups but if there are complaints about managers behavior then it is time to give someone else a chance. 
Lowe's Home Improvement,Front Operations Manager,3,Depends on the manager and the team in place. Has potential to be great but metrics and low labor budgets overwork associates most of the time. Was good til It wasnt.
Lowe's Home Improvement,Fulfillment Lead,2,"Accepted a position as fulfillment lead. They saddled me with somebody who should have been fired long before I started working there. But otherwise the rest of my team was great.Then they started firing people (including the store manager), and severely cutting back hours for all part time workers. So naturally people quit. Eventually my entire ""team"" was myself and one part timer. For 4 months it was like this with seemingly zero effort to fill positions. All while management turned a blind eye to the fact we were barely holding things together. When we finally got new hires, I was still routinely scheduled by myself with no team present to actually lead.I was regularly instructed to ignore standard operation procedures (because doing so would make management look worse and hurt our theoretical sales numbers) to the detriment of my performance metrics and give preferential treatment to certain people and departments.Then when they finally couldn't ignore how bad performance metrics dropped, I was their sacrificial lamb to save their jobs for another quarter or two.I worked for their direct competitor for 9 years and was never treated so poorly in all that time than I was in the one year I worked at Lowe's."
Lowe's Home Improvement,"Stocker, Receiver, and Merchandiser",1,"Heartless corporate company that claims to care for veterans and employees. Low compensation, low employee discount, powerless management, and chronically depressing morale."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Customer Service Specialist,3,"Typical days were long, coworkers always had unfriendly attitudes, some managers were unwilling to work with you on your schedule. Overall it has the potential to be a great place of employment but the lack or moral was incredibly draining."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Sales Associate,2,"As a former employee of Lowe’s, I can attest firsthand to the detrimental impact of its poor management practices on both staff and customers. One of the most glaring issues is the lack of leadership and support from upper management. Managers often seemed disconnected from the day-to-day operations, which led to chronic understaffing, especially during peak hours when customer service was in highest demand. This not only left employees overwhelmed and scrambling to cover multiple departments but also resulted in customers experiencing long wait times and difficulty finding assistance.Furthermore, communication between managers and employees was often unclear or nonexistent, causing unnecessary confusion and frustration. Schedules were frequently changed at the last minute without any notification, making it almost impossible for employees to plan their personal lives. Instead of focusing on creating a positive work environment, managers often prioritized micromanaging trivial details, which hindered productivity and morale. Ultimately, the lack of proper management led to a stressful and demotivating workplace culture, making it an unpleasant experience for both staff and customers alike."
Lowe's Home Improvement,MSA,2,"Loved Lowe's, loved my job. But they only allow you 7 missed days in a year. And no, doctor notes do not excuse an absence. Kids daycares or schools being closed does not excuse an absence. It was just impossible for anyone to stay employed here if you had kids or any health issues. "
Lowe's Home Improvement,Customer Service Associate,4,"Definitely enjoyed my time working there in retrospect. Very easy to get along with other employees so don’t worry about any stiff kind of atmosphere. There are things that I did wish management would have actually dealt with though but they’d probably have to shut down the store for a few days to do it, so probably not going to happen. "
Lowe's Home Improvement,Sales Associate ,2,"It depends on what department and store one's self is in , and what managers one's self has . After hired the initial months at the store will probably be adequate. But after a year it often becomes inadequate. Hours get cut often and theirs a dismal chance that anything will change. Promotions won't probably happen and there is favoritism by the managers , which makes a caste system among employees."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Sales Associate,4,"Lowe's has changed a lot. Not enough staff to meet customers needs. Many complaints about nobody in a department to help. They really need to hire more people on each shift. It seems like after Covid they kept a slimmed down  staff. They need to go back to more associates. The other day I watched an associate cashier at self check out, assist a customer in an aisle, and look for batteries on an end cap for a customer. They had to get down on floor to look for batteries. I did this while waiting for 2 hours for a loader. When the loader got there finally he said nobody told me the entrance. They have smart phones. Wouldn't you just ask a manager to find out for you? Didn't make sense to me. To my knowledge cashiers are supposed to stay near registers and they can't abandon them to go down and aisle. Good luck Lowe's."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Payroll Specialist,2,"Workplace culture - It used to be a family friendly company and a friendly place to work. They have now engaged fully with the DEI culture. It doesn't matter if you can't understand the work, the ones that do will have to take up the slack for the DEI employees.Management - They do their best with what they have, but will not be transparent with you. Be prepared to be blindsided and just deal with it. "
Lowe's Home Improvement,Assistant Store Manager - Operations,3,"The atmosphere of associates feels like a family, but the overall environment is stressful with no regard to work/life balance. Staffing is always extremely low due to reduced payroll and lack of accountability for attendance. Managers are spread thin trying to meet expectations without staffing to complete said tasks. Interview/hiring process is unnecessarily lengthy which results in extended timeframes with positions unfilled. Expect to work extended hours and work to follow you home.   "
Lowe's Home Improvement,Customer Service Representative,1,"bad management , no real management experience is needed and management will write you up and conspirers with lower management to make themselves look good, its a high school click"
Lowe's Home Improvement,Customer Service Associate,2,"Overall it was not too bad but also kinda bad.  I got paid and I did my job.  Management left me alone for the most part as long as I was doing my job.  It was easy but pay was low and the hours were rough. But for some odd reason, it also wasn't too bad.  "
Lowe's Home Improvement,Sales Associate,5,Great culture and work life balance. Typical day was working your section and doing your tally tasks and helping customers with products. Great job for sute 
Lowe's Home Improvement,Customer Service Representative,5,What is the best part of working at the company?It was really easy job and the management made everything easy for you to understand your position at work. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?When customers can't find what they came to the store for and when you tried to help them only to find out the item is only online.

Lowe's Home Improvement,Parcel Sorter,3,management sucks and isn’t worth it overall but it is a leisurely place that i’d recommend as a summer job for students who don’t have things to do at all
Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier,1,Fast paced and very understaffed. Management is ok at the store level but regional management and above is clueless on the day to day. They like to place managers through their trainee positions -- who do not know anything about the stores. 
Lowe's Home Improvement,Sales Associate,5,Pretty good no complaints the work environment is good and steady keeps you busy but could be hard to find employees at times and you’ll have to look 
Lowe's Home Improvement,MST Manager,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?The job I had was Monday through Friday weekends off.

They will make you run departments yourself that you know nothing about. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic, two faced. They don’t look after there employees.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Day to day is different. But for the most part it is stressful."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Overnight Stocker,1,"It’s a job that’ll get you by but if you want anything more than a 10 cent raise you literally have to beg. Under paid for the amount of work you do, management doesn’t care about you or your health. This job ruined my health."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Merchandise Service Associate,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Leaving, dead end job where the buddy system operates.

Don’t torture yourself here. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Policy changes everyday , only applies to certain people when It Needs to. Can’t just everyone follow the policy everyday?What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Work environment is like High school. , everyone is trying to have s@x with each other.

Lowe's Home Improvement,Customer Service Associate,4,"Some people are cool, others aren’t. Other than that, like all jobs and places, you have your good days and your bad days. Sometimes dogs come in and that’s fun. "

Lowe's Home Improvement,Assistant Store Manager,2,"As Lowe's has continued to change, it's changed for the worse. It's all about the bottom line instead of the employees. They keep taking job perks and reneging on promised schedules. "
Lowe's Home Improvement,Retail Associate,2,"not worth the mental drain and bad mouthed gossip, anyone who is of higher importance would rather snarl at you like a kid then explain their issue with you, just childish "
Lowe's Home Improvement,Sales Associate,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Nice coworkers.  There's not much good working here besides that.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Employees get lectured by managers if they don't get customers to apply for store credit cards and fill out surveys. Also, when a price needs to be changed,  which is frequently,  a manager has to override and they make you and the customers wait like 10 to 15 minutes before they come to your register for the override.  Embarrassing on a daily basis.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work culture is OK as far as pizza parties and such, but you have to be available from open to close to get a full-time position,  so absolutely no work life balance.What is a typical day like for you at the company?They're short staffed like all industries these days. Many days you have to bug your supervisor for coverage when your shift ends because no one comes to work. You're expected to do the work of several people for this reason also."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Blind Sales / shutters / home decor,5,Was great working at Lowes. I enjoyed the skills I learnt on the Blind cutting machine and becoming a perfectionist in my apprentice period. I enjoyed the hard work and meeting new people every single day at work - including cute dogs!  You have to just be tough in everything you do. That's life. Let your personality shine and don't lose sight of your dreams. Lots of opportunity to complete trainings and grow in your skill set. Sales commission was scrapped by the time I came into blind sales. So even though my sales skill set grew I never got rewarded or recognized for it and that hurt me financially. So I ended up leaving to grow in my sales skills with commission. 
Lowe's Home Improvement,Cashier,4,"I really liked working for lowes, the staff was great for the most part and the schedule was consistant.  The store was always so busy southern was alot of heavy traffic but the managers stepped in when needed. "

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The company's unrealistic expectations, at least at my store, which really boils down to the senior management that ""Runs the store"" for lack of a better term. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Lack of direction and wishy washy policy enforcement and continuously throwing staff ""under the bus"" has created a situation of ver Very low morale. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Constant pressure to hit sales numbers, while covering other departments and performing tasks that aren't a part of job description."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Assistant Store Manager,3,"The corporate rotating schedule sucks…only one weekend off a month.  Depending on role, there are a ton of closing shifts.  Never expect to leave on time and count on staying late!"
Lowe's Home Improvement,Lowes associate,5,Lowes is a good place to work and you will learn a lot. The only thing not appealing is working until close and the having to come open.  There is a lot of training you can get while working at Lowes.
Lowe's Home Improvement,Manager,1,"Micromanaged to death. No work/life balance. CEO and executive management are greedy SOBs that only push compliance to their ridiculous gameplan which you're stuck doing jobs of 10 people. DEI initiatives are insane. Lowe's has become the ""Wokest"" company in this sector."
Lowe's Home Improvement,Front End Associate,5,What is the best part of working at the company?I absolutely love working at roundrock Lowe's.

Lowe's Home Improvement,MST Associate,2,"Merchandising Store Team--Worked in Live Nursery, watering plants, unloading racks of flowers. Went inside to service bays after watering.

AIG,Administrative Assistant Senior,5,"My day with AIG was a productive work day, with ""supportive management""  in a familial atmosphere.   I learned the understanding of administrative procedures.  My role require dynamism, adaptability, and flexibility to handle evolving tasks and challenges.  The fulfillment comes when successfully navigating through these changes and completing the job."
AIG,Vice President,5,"Worked there for a bit, lots of changes but good if you are patient and keep working hard. Seems the Corebridge new public co worked out well, though still lots of influence from AIG"
AIG,Lead,3,The company is gigantic and there are a lot of opportunities. Management is not micromanaging. Pay is not that great. Some remote opportunities. Good place to learn the insurance business 
AIG,First Level Nurse Reviewer,4,The job was a new experience for me . It was a different dimension of Nursing. It was extremely stressful and the work place culture was 1 sided. I met some amazing people that some were extremely supportive. Management (some) was horrible only listened to one side of a situation producing frustration and mistrust. 
AIG,Underwriting Assistant,3,Pay isnt bad. Time off and additional 401k contributions are above market. Work flexibility is great. The people and teams you work with directly greatly influence how good(or bad) your experience will be here. I was fortunate to work with fantastic teams while I was hear. The constant uncertainty and layoffs add a great deal of stress to the day to day if you're not comfortable dealing with that sort of thing 
AIG,Quality Auditor,4,"Throughout my career, by far this was the best company I have worked for!.Senior staffs are very friendly and helpful.No micromanaging or disrespect.Great place to work - feel appreciated and valued "

Only room with air conditioning is the break room which is small & you can only go in there on breaks otherwise management tells you to get back to work. Bad ownership & management with no care for anyone or anything but making their own money.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Working 10-12 hour days at a fast pace constantly, handling glass while expecting everyone to be safe & not get hurt. Blazing heat or freezing cold environment. Ownership that doesn’t respect or uphold agreements made between them & workers about raises. Constantly being rushed by higher ups to work faster."

AIG,Provider Bill Auditor Analyst ,2,"Dictatorship Management, constant unexpected layoffs, favoritism and don't even get me started on the meager pay scale. They constantly added more work for same pay and eventually outsourced our whole department to Manila lay everyone off. I was there for 15 years and had zero regard for me and other coworkers that were there 22+ years. I would never work for this company again, Run ,don’t walk from any position they offer you.

Its an incredible job right out of college as I feel like the job prepared me for my next role very well but despite AIG dedicating resources and money to training their young employees, they pay below market (30% or more below). Does not seem like a good business model as other companies will pay more after AIG spends years developing and training their employees. AIG is known to underpay but in general, was a supportive and solid organization "
AIG,General Operative,2,"Easy job, nice people around. The pay is good and relatively easy to get promoted if you have your head over your shoulders. There are some people that enjoy making your life harder but hey, it´s job"

AIG,Auditor,3,Travel and a lot of work always provided enough to do. But sometimes it could be overwhelming. Team kept shrinking but workload was consistent or growing.
AIG,Claims Adjuster,1,"The work is sold for you about 40 hours a week from Monday to Friday, but in the contract you sign these about 48 hours, and be careful and you go out at your time of departure or arrive at your time of entry, because they will see youugly.They will harass you until you give up or find a way to say goodbye.They will tell you that they help you unconditionally and that you always have their support, but you will never see that it is true.The Mauricio Echeverry Correa is spent speaking pests of all his collaborators, he can get to the ice of the ice if you don't like it."

AIG,Internal Audit Graduate ,4,"Decent place to work, people are very friendly. It is based in central London and Croydon so you get flexible to go to either office. The job is quite different. "
AIG,Project Manager,3,Good job and great people to work with. there is a lot expected from you but it is worth the work. the reason for only 3 stars is you don't have much job security
AIG,事故受付センター,5,"I felt that there was no harassment because I could make it easy to report the harassment.The accident reception center felt that the balance between the amount of work and the salary side was well -balanced, and I think it was better than other departments.Due to the accident reception, there are relatively many customers in a hurry, and various demands are made even on weekends and nights, so it may be difficult for others."

AIG,営業職,2,"I think that if you have English and academic ability, you can join the company by general occupation, but it is mainly new graduates.Mid -career recruitment will be a contract employee, and depending on the business performance, it will continue or cancel.If you can always maintain high grades due to your high performance, you can expect high income and independence as an agency.You can aim for the business owner and president in 5 years.It is a perfect company for those who are good at tele appointments and jumping.About 2%of employees who joined the company as a contract employee are independent."
AIG,内勤スタッフ,5,"It was my favorite job, so it was the most fun job ever.I worked as a mid -career in -house work, but it was an environment where I could hear that I couldn't understand the training.The welfare interest was good, and the salary side worked without any problems.If you have the opportunity, you want to work again.The atmosphere of the company was very good and easy to work."

AIG,Director of Sales,4,"Challenging work, always changing. Technology needed a lot of upgrades. Bonuses were hard to achieve at least in 2018/19. People were great. The mission is important"

AIG,VP of Marketing,3,"Good people, poor leadership team. Lack of clear prioritization. Good benefits, great 401k match. Good vacation policy. The company has been reducing its FTEs over the past few years. They are outsourcing many jobs to consulting companies. Employees don't have a choice."
AIG,Business System Analyst - Claims Assistant,2,"When employed at AIG, the co-workers were the best part about working there. Other than that, management was terrible. You either had power-hungry or passive managers. I saw a lot of discrimination based on race and age. Also, I saw a lot of cherry-picking ""yes"" employees for positions.  I have a friend still there, and I know its more of the same. This company didn't seem to care about the people who actually do the job, as it was related to promotion.  So my co-workers and I became a family. We would really enjoy each other in and out of the office. These people are still my friends today. Unfortunately, I met them in such a place that it forced us to bond."
AIG,Legal Assistant,3,"Morale is low due to incompetent managers who have been there too long. Hardest part of the job was knowing that after honestly addressing issues, nothing was done, except for the work environment becoming even more hostile than before. "
AIG,Bills Keying Associate,3,"move on to greener pasture asap, it's a humbling experience in there and a good start. but soon you'll realize you need to find a more rewarding job that pays more"
AIG,Ajustador,4,"BUEN LUGAR PARA TRABAJAR, JEFES BUENA ONDA, LA EMPRESA EN GENERAL ES AGRADABLE EL PROBLEMA ES QUE SON MUCHAS HORAS DE CHAMBA Y SIEMPRE HAY CHAMBA ATRASADA"
AIG,Premium Auditor,4,"Good company, great pay and benefits. Like other insurance carriers, inventory can run high and risk overworking it’s employees. Overall a good experience and decent management."
AIG,Underwriting Assistant,5,"Good culture and work-life balance. As an underwriting assistant, it was easy to get things on hand with good training provided. You can also have flexible working arrangement."
AIG,Underwriting Assistant,3,"+ Good schedule (35 hours a week), many days of vacation+ attractive location (Torre Realia in Plaza Castilla)- Computing Systems quite bad- badly organized work"
AIG,営業職,3,"Because of foreign -affiliated companies, they are completely talented companies.It is a basically business style for corporate non -life insurance business, and at first 100%newly opened, tele -app and dive business.If you can't get the results, you may be cut off by the assessment, but I think the newcomer education system, salary system, and benefits are wonderful.Also, I was saved when I was about to be crushed because I had a strong connection with synchronization and seniors."
AIG,Claims Adjuster,3,"Joined AIG in 2014 and it was a great company for many years, however by 2020 the claim volume became unmanageable.  They could not keep our team fully staffed and those of us who stayed worked overtime, weekends, and holidays to stay above water.  This included  taking PTO to try and catch up on things without the phone ringing off the hook. It was a real sweatshop.  "
AIG,Senior Business Analyst,3,"Pros: Benefits: PTO days!!! 401K, Medical, Dental, Vision etc.I liked working for this company because I had responsibilities at home (sick parents) that they really worked with me on such as time off for medical reasons for appointments and allowing WFH. Cons: compensation was horrible for me coming in at a lower salary messed me up for the lifetime of my employment here (as annual increases ended in 2008).  Management can be a mixed bag depending on who you end up with, it can be good, bad, or ugly."
AIG,Claims Adjuster,3,High standards; Good place to learn how to be an adjuster and learn best practices ; very formal and corporate environment. Very low pay compared to other carriers  
AIG,Business Analyst,3,"Great benefits, and of course you’re backed by a prestigious company, but I had troubles with management. My manager was rude, condescending and overall a mean-spirited person. Wish I had better mgmt and support"
AIG,Customer Service Team Lead/Supervisor,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Best part of AIG was the work culture. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?When the calls were back to back. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?You always felt welcome no matter how your day was. We had rooms where we could go in and reset.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Answering calls and assisting license agents with their commissions and trainings
AIG,Claims Advisor,5,"great place to work, Good environment, with understanding team leaders and managers. Working from home is a bonus. All communication over teams so easy to keep up with developments "
AIG,trial attorney,5,Company provides alot of freedom in doing your work and provides you what you need.  People are very nice and claims partners easy to work with.  Salary is very competitive.
AIG,Director,3,Tons of change where nothing changes. Easy to sit and get paid. Alot of people who have been there a long time and don't want to change anything. Lots of firing constantly across all levels and depts. No remote work at all. Expensive benefits.
AIG,Remote Customer Advocate,1,"The warranty division based it of Jeffersonville, IN is horribly run. The leadership only cares about numbers. There is no actual direction on anything. Employees are kept in the dark until layoffs happen. The pay is awful and there is no room for advancement. Claims examiners are treated like call center employees with extremely strict metrics. The only thing keeping me here is the PTO (which is incredible) and the fact that I am able to work from home. Workplace culture is so negative it is exhausting. There are senior employees that are allowed to bully others in front of management and nothing is done about it. "
AIG,事務,4,"At this time, there is a major difference between regular employment and non -regular employment welfare.Employees have benefits such as the use of a massage room at a low price and the free annual membership fee for Amex.One month off (paid) will be given for 10 years.Both of the employees work very well and those who do nothing are both extreme.Even if you do not work, there is no sign of being instructed by your boss.Temporary employees have a large amount of work as a filling of employees who do not work.However, it depends on the department.I think there is a hit or out of which department.It is better to raise the hourly wage of temporary employees a little more.There is an unfair feeling because the amount of work varies from person to person.Many people are dissatisfied with their work.The atmosphere of the workplace is good, and if you get used to it, you can work happily.The office is on a high floor (35 floors or higher), but the smoking area is on the 9th floor, so smokers often remove their seats.If you are a baby smoker, you may have left for one hour in the day for smoking.Smokers take a break as usual, and non -smokers want a paid break in the morning and afternoon."
HCA Healthcare,RN,4,"Great experience, lots of resources to be able to do your job safely,l. I worked for them for a year and so far has been the best hospital job. The managers are helpful. "
HCA Healthcare,Clinical Pharmacy Specialist,3,"Enjoy pto and covered parking, relatively good benefits.  Corporate/ management are secretive and feel like often lied to. Many issues reported over and over again and same issues do not get resolved.  Poor leadership. "
HCA Healthcare,Registered Nurse,2,I work as a med surg nurse and highly do not recommend. The ratio is 1 to 6 patients however the population of the patients you get are horrible. Some are nice who respects you as a nurse but majority of the time they will treat you bad. You will 100% get reported and management will make you apologize to the patient even when you’re just doing your job. They will always side with the patients because they want their patient satisfaction rate to be high. I don’t feel respected and when I need help; no one is willing too because they are always in meeting or auditing. 
HCA Healthcare,Food Service Supervisor,2,"A day in Food and Nutrition Dept, we serve patient meals 3 times a day, 4 days straight and work 13 hour days. I'm convinced this is not good work life balance. Everyone else works an 8 hour shift and goes home. They would be better served if everyone was scheduled an 8 hour shift. There is a disconnect between management and staff, with no understanding or empathy."
HCA Healthcare,Medical assistant ,2,"The pay is super low compared to other businesses. The management is very poor, and PTO is a scam. You're told you have paid holidays but they come out of your personal PTO. Any time the office is closed, Including hurricanes, comes from your personal PTO. It's a scam and leaves you with little PTO to actually use when needed or wanted."
HCA Healthcare,Pharmacist,4,"Not the worst, not the best. Very corporate which isn't unexpected. Management is decent. Benefits are solid. Initial pay is good but yearly raises are minimal and not merit based."
HCA Healthcare,Staff Nurse,1,No raise and turnover was unbelievable. They made us work overtime and did pay out what we were owed. Hospital was sold and no notice given to employees.
HCA Healthcare,HR Assistant,4,"I recently had an experience with this company, and it was quite an experience! It felt like time passed in a unique way while I was there.The colors were nice, and the layout had a certain something to it. I noticed some interesting sounds, which added to the overall ambiance. If you’re looking for something different, this place certainly fits that description.Overall, I would say it was an experience worth having, whatever that means!This review intentionally avoids providing any specific information about the company, products, or services, making it vague and uninformative."
HCA Healthcare,Registered Nurse (RN),2,"Treats nurses like cogs in a machine, overworks staff for the sake of profit. Vague and unfair policies to trap staff in contracts or commitments they originally did not sign up for. "

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?most people don't work well ! and double the work had to be doneWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?I never understood why a bad comment was made and it was not taken into consideration !What is a typical day like for you at the company?he had always been involved with little collaboration !
HCA Healthcare,Coordinator,4,"Decent place to work, loved the team I worked with. Benefits and time off were decent. Definitely a corporate setting but expected being a large company. Lots of training which was great "
HCA Healthcare,Registered Nurse (RN),5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The company takes care of  every employee working there.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Only when working short . But there is extra support, to help to carry through the workload. The company is very supportive. AWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very safe work environment, and value cultural beliefs and values"
HCA Healthcare,Lead Mental Health Technician,1,"At valley C&A it's the best place to get a good understanding of a wide variety of mental health issues. The achilles heel of parkridge is that the decisions made reflect a business first mindset. nothing wrong with that, but they could stand to spend more time and resources in the operations at the smallest levels."
HCA Healthcare,RN Staff Nurse,5,"The hospital culture is fantastic! Great staff that make patient days/care easier. My specific unit is highly coordinated and it’s easy to get help from other unit members, management and doctors."
HCA Healthcare,Registered Nurse,4,This is a solid place to work for a fairly smooth running hospital system. The only issue is the amount of “busy work” that go into the annual evaluations. I’m leaving because I’m over that part but otherwise a really well run system.
HCA Healthcare,Registered Nurse,3,I have worked at various places and I have concluded There's no such thing as a perfect job. There's good and bad. Get in get out and you should be fine.
HCA Healthcare,Medical Laboratory Technologist,2,"-As of recent (for an entire year) we endured a staff-shortage/hiring freeze and never reached the staffing levels we were before. They've managed to increase profit by cutting/combining departments and increasing workload without ever supplementing us with new hires, due to the continual employees leaving, quitting, or moving to other departments. It was much better than but hopefully things will improve in the future. However I predict our moderate employee turnover rate to being a high employee turnover rate if they dont fix things soon.-Due to staff-shortage, the shift work turnover tends to be either poor to manageable. Due to that happening, sometimes we have to deal with late coworkers or seeing others leave work early (much less incentive to stay).-Management approaches with a very light hands-off approach. It definitely allows for the staff to operate without some obstacle however they don't provide much support either when we have issues. They are very reactive vs being proactive (taking months to implementing new procedures or resolving issues).-Typical day involves general patient testing, calibration, maintenance, and quality control just like any other hospital. Nothing different and standard compared to any other hospital. I will say that relaying information to nurses and providers was a moderate to difficult issue. (I assume that they are enduring a shortage as well?)-Their Meditech is a bit outdated but much better than CHCS for LIS.-I do like that I have attained a lot of experience due to the hospital being the central hub for net labs so we have a lot - more..."
HCA Healthcare,Clinical Nurse Coordinator,2,"Typical day at work: Short staffed... Overworked Staff (the ones that ""Show Up"")What I believe I learned: Well, this is subjective and applies to people differently. If you just clock in, do what you have to do, stay on tik tok, and clock out, you will not learn anything. Opportunities to learn ARE JUST TOO MANY to mention. I learned a lot because the chance and opportunity was provided. I was eager to learn. Management: Meeehhh, it depends, I guess. Some places have outstanding management while others, have an ADN as a Director, with no clue about culture, no clue about management skills, people skills, or sense in priority. Workplace Culture: Some HCA Hospitals like to push their limits and will strive to do more with less. This is totally unsafe, I do not entertain this culture. However, there are some HCA that do have a solid financial and staff/ patient management.  Hardest Part of the Job: Work at a Trauma Hospital short staffed. I don't understand why this keeps on happening. A Trauma Hospital should be ALWAYS ready for a mass casualty. Outnumbering the patient/ nurse ratio leaves ZERO ROOM for catastrophe management. The Most Enjoyable Part of the Job. My colleagues and my patients. IF AN HCA MANAGER READS THIS PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT: The patient's and their family member HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD to track every little thing the nurses and the unit manager do. They are doing nothing but waiting. In their boredom ""they snoop"" . They see the nurses agitated from being overworked, the unit understaffed, or the unit staffed with unqualified floaters. ER - more..."
HCA Healthcare,Physician,2,"HCA provides quality healthcare. It is a poor environment for practicing primary care, however, where they are aggressively eliminating PCP positions. The physical work environment is adequate. Staff support is average but adequate. Mid-level and regional management is what we've come to expect from corporate medical administration; robotic and impersonal. Very difficult to succeed as a startup primary care practice but possible to succeed if taking over an existing practice (i.e. from a retiring physician). Strictly a financially-driven environment. Specialists are highly valued, but would encourage primary care (FP, IM, pediatrics) to look elsewhere. Best part of the job (as always) is the direct patient care. Most difficult part (as always), dealing with administration where there is high turnover, poor personal professional relationship, and erratic decision making."
HCA Healthcare,RN,4,We have a wonderful management team on our unit and great coworkers. The facility is still relatively new as well                                                        
HCA Healthcare,Associate Client Support Analyst,4,"I love what I do but I'm learning the hard way that Health care workers get sucky  Health Insurance. The discount that is received if you use HCA facilities is great, if you live near HCA facilities which I don't. I have to drive an hour from home to go to one. No HCA facility? Then prepare to get bills in the mail after doctor appointments. No paid holidays you have to request off and if u actually get off, it comes out of your PTO bucket.  "
HCA Healthcare,RN,4,"Great experience, lots of resources to be able to do your job safely,l. I worked for them for a year and so far has been the best hospital job. The managers are helpful. "

HCA Healthcare,Sonographer,3,"Great group of coworkers, great benefits but constantly short staffed due to pay rates significantly lower than competitors. Generally work life balance a bit better than other places but expect to be slammed the entire shift"
HCA Healthcare,Registered Nurse,1,Culture is so toxic and demeaning. HCA does not care for one minute about their employees. Highly unprofessional and toxic culture encouraged and even was join in by managers and physician. 
HCA Healthcare,Certified Occupational Therapy Assistant,2,The EMR is so outdated it's not even funny. The pay is low and you have to work at least one Saturday a month. You have to rotate holidays off and find your own coverage when you want to take vacation. If you want to be paid fairly for your skills this is not the place. Corporate greed at its finest. 
HCA Healthcare,Registered Nurse (RN),4,Most management was great. People are friendly and helpful. A bit short staffed on the units at times but manageable. Very flexible schedule. She works with you and any way she can. Agency sucked  but not the facilities fault. If you avoid the drama- good place to work. 
HCA Healthcare,ICU Registered Nurse,1,Mismanagement by NM in MSICU. Nurses are not inadequate in critical thinking and patient safety care. Charge nurses are not helpful with minimum knowledge and skills. 
HCA Healthcare,Physical Therapist,4,"Workload is very manageable.Patient population is consistent and predictable. Friendly coworkersSalary/hourly rate less than other facilities. You stay with this organization/ facility for the ease of work, not the pay"

HCA Healthcare,Staff Nurse,1,"Some of the sites are good in terms of support and management, but one particular site was awful as the nurse managers were such bullies. Workplace culture-wise there is a lot of gossipping which takes away the joy of working.Training was excellent."
HCA Healthcare,Nurse Extern,1,"Per diem shifts were great and you were able to create your own schedule but the patient ratio was overwhelming! HCA is known for that! They always cancelled my shifts or others and then left us short staffed for the day resulting in two pct/nurse extern for 50+ patients (depends on the unit). If you're in nursing school they will still convince you to work on the days you have class because they ""need"" help but in reality they cancelled everyone shift."
HCA Healthcare,Registered Nurse (RN),4,"As a nurse, I have had the privilege of working in a collaborative and patient-centered environment that consistently prioritizes high-quality care. The organization fosters a supportive atmosphere where teamwork and continuous learning are encouraged, allowing nurses to grow both professionally and personally. Leadership is responsive and committed to maintaining a culture of safety and inclusivity, ensuring that both staff and patients feel valued.

HCA Healthcare,ER Technician / Behavior Health Tech,3,What is the best part of working at the company?Employee Share program. Some of the nurses are nice.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working for this company. Management doesn't care about you as a worker. They only think about customer service.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's very stressful. And the attitude of the managers are bad. Security is a joke.
HCA Healthcare,Caregiver,5,"I enjoy working with this company because they honestly work with you on days off, Scheduling what works for you and your family. Management is great communicate with you if they don’t know the next person will look into it then make sure you get the answer you want!!!"

HCA Healthcare,Mental Health Technician,1,"This company was awful to work for. As a mental health technician in the ER, employees are constantly being put in danger and management doesn't care."
HCA Healthcare,PCT (Patient Care Technician),4,"Pay was great for the area. Coworkers are fun. Always was an opportunity to earn extra money with overtime if desired. Incentives were offered in Tiers (1-3) during times are desperate need of PCTS. It consist of $3, $6, to $9 extra per hour. Annual pay raise was about $1. PRN make more per hour than full time and part time staff. PRN starting is 19$ and full time and part time starting is 16$. I was CNA certified and they accepted me to work as a PCT. A majority of the PCTs at this hospital are CNAs. This hospital will hire everyone, they are desperate for PCTs. All the floors have their pros and cons. I have floated to almost every unit in the General hospital and I have to say 5 North (Neuro) is by far the worst unit. Everyday duties of a PCT consist of getting vitals, changing patients, changing linens, and assistance with ADLs. "

HCA Healthcare,Medical Office Coordinator/ Call Center ,1,"Management was awful , HR nightmare, no benefits , no time off with out a scolding , no support . A company that will sweep issues under the rug instead of being fair and hearing all parties . A company that will lie to your face from the beginning and tell you there’s growth and they are happy with growth .  A company that protects the lazy because they are loyal and aren’t going anywhere , but will turn on someone who wants better for the company who wants the growth . "
HCA Healthcare,Remote Customer Service Representative,4,Phone has nonstop calls and you have to follow a scripted QA that you get scores on monthly. Raises aren’t from performance but from yearly economical living increases 
HCA Healthcare,Licensed Practical Nurse,4,We work as a team on the medsurg unit.  Coworkers are always willing to step in and help. I learned a lot as an LPN working in the hospital.

HCA Healthcare,Registered Nurse,1,This place is incredibly disorganized. I came on as a new grad and was metaphorically thrown to the wolves. There is too much pressure to be high functioning with such little experience.

HCA Healthcare,Nurse Extern,3,Pros- I learned a lot. I was able to practice nursing skills while still in nursing school. Cons- Horrible work conditions. Always understaffed and under supported.  I often had 15-19 patients as a tech. Bad pay. Higher management does nothing to help issues in the hospital.
HCA Healthcare,RN,4,"     The hospital provides a great variety of services to the community.  Their current motto is ""We Show Up"".        I have learned about cardiac interventions and conscious sedation.     The hardest part of the job is the overtime and on-call hours.

HCA Healthcare,Practice Manager,5,Fun collaborative work environment. Good corporate culture and very patient friendly.  Worked with great teams of people.  Staff ratios were very good.
HCA Healthcare,Market Director of Clinical Professional Development,4,"Very fulfilling, great culture and environment to work in. The corporate level members have been some of the best mentors I have had the pleasure of working with."
HCA Healthcare,Registered Nurse,3,"2west medsurg floor is hectic most days, but the ratio is normal 1:6. Half of the nights i work there is not adequate staff. nurses are constantly late to relieve you, i guess their attendance policy isn't enforced much. "
HCA Healthcare,RN Staff Nurse,3,You will definitely see a variety of people to help. Staff are some of the best in the city. The company is for profit it seemed good until Covid hit and we had to wear the same N95 for five shifts straight or subject our masks to be shipped off to be “cleaned”
HCA Healthcare,Lab Technician,5,I am a Lab Tech Assistant (phlebotomist) I love what I do I love my coworkers I love all the growth opportunities within. Very helpful team whenever help is needed. 
HCA Healthcare,RN,3,"This company is all about the profits and less about employee support! They are just worried about ""numbers"" of any kind and how to support their upper management in many the most money.  "
HCA Healthcare,"Bradenton, FL",1,"Always short staffed.  HCA does not care about their employees; you will be replaced in due time. Limited to no merit increase.  Broken and damaged equipment.  Management and Human Resources are incompetent.   HR does not respond in timely manner.  Hire nonclinical managers as well as regional directors to be in charge of dept. making clinical decisions.  HCA is unable to retain management or staffing, it's a revolving door.   Hardest part of the job is getting up to go to work.  Most enjoyable is leaving for the day, weekends and vacation time.  If you work at HCA, be prepared for burnout.   "
HCA Healthcare,Registered Nurse (RN),3,"Typical work day- short staffed, RN to patient ratios are 1:5 on IMU / step down, 1:6 on CVT, sometimes only 1  tech to help the RN’s on day shift and sometimes no techs on night shift. They max out the ratios and don’t have a back up plan so Charge nurses sometimes get 4 patients while they’re charging. Director works for administration wishes (to save the hospital money), not for the nurses. Culture is great, RN’s help each other bc we’re usually short staffed and stressed out. Most day nurses don’t get a lunch until 1-2pm, some don’t until 3-4pm. No one comes to relieve us for lunches and when you do take a lunch your fellow nurses have to watch your 5 patients plus their 5 patients, management does not come help relieve staff. Nurses leave in mass exits each year once their 1 year residency,  contract/ commitment is over. HCA has their own travel agency (health trust) but they will leave you short staffed rather than bring in the travel nurses to  staff the floors with decent ratios. Charting with meditech is like using a computer from 1983. "
HCA Healthcare,Registered Nurse,3,"The ICU was a very busy, 26 bed unit and we were often understaffed which resulted in being tripled all the time. Charge nurses were helpful at times. Pay was okay."
HCA Healthcare,Patient Care Technician,2,Don’t even apply here lol this place is a joke. You will be the only one on the floor with over 20 patients. They admit everyone to the floor just for money 
HCA Healthcare,Facilities Technician,1,What is the best part of working at the company?The benefits are good the employees not so goodWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The laziness of the HVAC team
HCA Healthcare,Emergency Department Manager,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great benefits and competitive pay. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lack of resources causing clinical teams to cut corners in patient care. Leadership demands are impossible to sustain or make headway. Very high turnover in leadership. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Fake. Lip service without execution or follow up. The only way you survive in leadership is if you ""drink the cool aid"" and leave your morals and ethics at the door. Metrics and numbers trump patient care. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Constant juggling. Barely keeping your head above water while job responsibilities continue to pile up. Extremely high turnover rates cause added roles since there is no one else to dump it on."
HCA Healthcare,Practice Manager,1,"I loved my job, I learned something new all the time. I was hired to work a brand new clinic, help build volume.  I was doing great when it came to my job. Unfortunately, the staff and leadership were not supportive, and I was targeted and pushed out of my position that I held for a year"
HCA Healthcare,RN,5,I would say poor pay but I think they have decent benefits. I did like the management. It can be a very heavy workload. Nurse to patient ratios are high
HCA Healthcare,Supply Technician,4,It is hard to keep staff. They offer low pay. They are asked to do more and more. Hard to advance. No parking for employees. Food court is a disaster. 
HCA Healthcare,Histology Technician,5,I love everything about this lab. Fantastic people to work with including doctors and they have enough work to last you the entire day/shift. Management is also superb.
HCA Healthcare,"Director, Patient Safety and Risk Management ",1,"What is the best part of working at the company?My co-workers, the job description, the areaWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Total disrespect and dishonesty of senior leadership What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The culture is the worst I have ever seen in 50 years of work What is a typical day like for you at the company?There were no typical days - nature of the job"
HCA Healthcare,Director,4,"I had a very positive experience working for HDH.  However, the executive team I worked for has moved on.  I do hear their replacements continued a positive work environment."
HCA Healthcare,Registered Nurse,4,"I came from another, smaller hospital system. Loved all the training and support provided during the orientation process. I was part time so schedule was great and fit my life well. "
Cisco,Software Engineer,4,"Great pay and benefitsWork life balance could be betterCulture depends on your manager and teamMost teams are very busy, the problems are challenging and the schedule is tight "
Cisco,Executive Communications Manager,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?A few managers really care. Overall the benefits are decentWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?For being a ""Best Place to Work,"" layoffs are rampant. You or multiple people you know will be impacted. Likely multiple times. Corporate promises opportunities to move and grow, but no matter how many trainings you take and employee resource groups you're in - unless you have a tremendously strong advocate who ""knows someone"" - you'll be stuck. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Not what's advertised. There are incredibly toxic pockets and the mental toll of watching your coworkers get picked off by layoffs is exhausting. But at least each employee gets access to a free therapy app for a year or so?What is a typical day like for you at the company?Chaotic. Leaders spend so much time fighting each other that they don't come up with clear, useful strategies, so every day is either waiting to be allowed to work on something or working on something that will never be finished."
Cisco,Contract Manager,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Great work life balance. Holiday shutdown.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Layoffs every six months.  You never know when it's you. The Executive Leaders are 1000% out of touch with people lower than management levels. They pander to vps and higher that drink and play golf.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very inclusive until they lay you off and then everyone you thought was a friend treats you like you have the plague.
Cisco,Marketing Manager,4,"Enjoyed working at Cisco but after the Splunk acquistion, job security kept me up most nights and eventually was impacted from restructuring.Management was helpful and had your back in career growth.Fast paced environment where critical thinking/problem solving are skills you eventually develop.Overall, I would go back to work there as the people were fun to work with and the benefits were great."
Cisco,Business Operations Analyst,2,"Started working as a red badge in Cisco, loved the work culture and the benefits. Then moved as internal and the problems started. The managers are great people but some of them don't leverage the skills that they have ok their teams, there's a lot of gatekeeping with the big projects, and they require A LOT of skills to be hired and once you're in, you just end up using excel and not being able to be creative or innovate because you get no access to the required tools. Then moved to another role hoping that I could leverage my skills and keep growing professionally, and the same thing happened, you end up being chained to excel because the people that have been at Cisco for YEARS require it to be this way. The people are great, the environment is very respectful but the growth is hindered by old practices and bureaucracy. Now you have to add the constant layoffs to the recipe. "
Cisco,Technical Project Manager,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The complete support and encouragement each day by co-workers and my supervisor.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?There really was little if any stress that I experienced.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?encouraged to learn, friendly, and generally positive.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Always something new, interactive with customers and Cisco team mates."
Cisco,Train,1,I worked here for a year and the perm staff have no respect for the contractors. I  would never work there again. It’s sad when companies separate their contractors from regular employees. 
Cisco,BDM,3,"Competitive salaries, slow growth, super frequent layoffs, good coworkers and great exposure . I recommend as first job , but don’t try to make a career here or you will end up with mental issues due to job instability "
Cisco,Linux Engineer,3,In the past 4 or 5 years there has been a major shift in culture from upper management where upper management cares more about their bonuses than success of the company or business unit.  If your business unit is loosing market share and/or profit every year a new strategy is needed.
Cisco,Account Manager,4,"Great company with good people and solid product portfolio in networking. However losing ground and relevance with collaboration, security and the cloud portfolio. Too much restricting after the acquisition of Splunk creating too much internal uncertainty about your job longevity "
Cisco,Change Manager,4,"Overall my experience at Cisco was a good one with mostly supportive leadership, good coworkers, and great benefits. Due to the economy the recent years have been. A struggle with reorganizations but I believe that’s the case everywhere"
Cisco,"BUSINESS ANALYST, Licensing & Fulfillment (DSO - Post Sale)",5,"I worked for the AppDynamics division.  I learned a lot about the APM software business - I believe this emerging technology can only grow.  Management is supportive and flexible.  Culture is great - to be honest, it's a CA company - I could have gone to less diversity meetings - it was overkill and my team was very diverse.  It just felt forced.   For me, the hardest part of my job is that it was not a fit for me.  I was an individual contributor and I was used to being more involved in strategy and left for a strategic Sales Operations role - to a culture that was by comparison - ""lacking"" but the role was a better fit for me and the pay was aggressive - so I left.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the culture.  The people were great - I REALLY have no complaints."
Cisco,Software Engineer,4,"Cisco is consistently rated as one of the best places to work, and while the benefit structure and overall culture support that I can't help but feel let down by constant layoffs and consistent milquetoast social interactions among my team"
Cisco,Senior Data Engineer,2,"This company does 5% layoffs every year. You'll never have job security, you will forever be in fear of losing your position to a global layoff. However having Cisco on your resume will look great on your resume for the rest of your career."
Cisco,Technical Support Engineer,5,Best WLB! Its a really good place to learn and good place to grow. Work life balance is amazing. Only thing that is missing is WFH but other than that its a great place to work.
Cisco,Customer Project Manager,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Environment - Good Working and Collaborative Benefits - Good Market ValueWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Everyday tasks, that cannot avoidWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Just like any other company. Collaborative, advance and busy.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Simple yet busy. Multiple works that will push you for your full capacity."
Cisco,"Sr. Manager, Software Development",5,I started as Engineer-2 and left Cisco as Sr. Manager in a span of 20 years. In my 20 years I had opportunities to work with industry  leaders. cutting edge technologies. 
Cisco,RTP,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Very good benefits, overall. family benefits, benefits to care for older family members, family planning, 401K, medical. All of it is excellent.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The culture of the company has changed significantly. There are layoffs every year. This year it's been twice.  The is also bad managers here, who disrespect and criticize in very negative ways instead of providing direct feedback with examples, and encouragement.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very negative right now. Everyone expects to be laid off. The leadership team is giving out a huge bonus plan 6 month ago. to now extreme cuts.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I have a global role.  So i am working different time zones and some times get very little sleep."
Cisco,Project Manager,5,"A: Typical day at work1- Initiating meeting between 7 and 8am to establish the operation goal for the day.2- Plan the day with the available staff.3- Execute the day operation4- Keep in contact with team leaders to monitor and control the daily output.5- 1hr before the day end confirm that the operation is on track and day can be close without any quality concerns. B:  LearnedWith teamwork and a trusted staff, your job is easier.C: Management.With a strong and supportive management team all projects can be accomplish Workplace culture:With team members from different culture and backgrounds I have learn to accept and see different ways to get the project completed within budget. Hardest part of the job:The hardest part of the job in the beginning and the but know how fulfilling it will be when we are done make it worth every effort. The most enjoyable part of the job:Is seeing the looks on the team face when they know they are a part of a project that will be successful for years to come.   "
Cisco,Salesforce DevSecOps Lead,2,Every quarter the leadership change and so does priority .Individual expected to be all rounder most of the time.I was hired as DevOps Lead and then due to reorg every 3 month priority change and I was forced to do developer job which is not my skill and desire .
Cisco,Business Analyst,5,Amazing company with a professional culture and business mission. Especially impressed with their P&C department.  Would highly recommend to family and friends.
Cisco,Software Engineer,4,"Great pay and benefitsWork life balance could be betterCulture depends on your manager and teamMost teams are very busy, the problems are challenging and the schedule is tight "
Cisco,QA Engineer,2,"Cisco's culture is inclusive, collaborative, and innovative, valuing diversity and work-life balance. Employees are encouraged to share ideas, work across teams, and enjoy flexible work arrangements."
Cisco,"Senior Director, Software Engineering",3,"So much potential, held back by poor management intent to hold onto great personal compensation.  Some good engineers here, but stuck in less than exciting tasks. "
Cisco,Software Engineer,4,Great WLB. To enjoy work you need to be in the right BU and right team. Culture can be better. Lot of potential but execution is key to everything.   
Cisco,Sr. Director,4,"Strong, smart, and amazing people to work with. You will learn from the best. The technology is superior and managers lead with care and empathy for their employees. "
Cisco,Internship,4,You will learn and grow. It is a good environment with good people and good environment. You have people who have experience and they guide you as well. 
Cisco,Support Engineer,2,"Company's executive leadership team, no longer is interested in innovation.They fund  acquisitions of other companies via their layoffs ""restructuring"".The executive team builds golden parachutes, and big$$$ regardless of company performance.Very toxic environment."
Cisco,Business Development Manager,5,"Great work environment ,Nice salary ,          Great perks , Awesome bonus                            Great stock allocation, healthy work culture , supportive staff          "
Cisco,Technical Lead,5,"Great placeGreat folks work in latest technology Great infrastructure Works on resolving key problems Great place, technology Great place, technology Felt good"
Cisco,Account Development Representative,5,MY manager never worried about a grey dot while remote so long as you did your job and hit your goals. Which was always set appropriately and I always hit. Great PTO and benefits! My team goes in office once a week and always has a great time. 
Cisco,Data Analyst,5,Great place. Productive and fun enviornment. Very great management. Very supportive and great perks. Very much inclusive work culture. There were people from all our world.
Cisco,Technical Consulting Engineer,3,The company itself is a good place to work. They have great benefits and fun events. Great onsite perks as well. The work life balance in TAC however is horrible. You easily fall behind and the workload is just isn’t realistic. Only good thing about TAC is as long as you do your job you pretty much have job security. Outside of TAC beware of layoffs. 
Cisco,Engineer,5,"Good wlb, a bit old school. Cafeteria food was good. Everyone I worked with was pleasant and willing to help answer questions. Overall, a great experience and would work here again"
Cisco,Architect,5,"Very good employees Good policiesWork life balanceGood salariesGood management Good managers Good cafeteria I’ve had an exceptional experience with cisco. From start to finish, their team displayed remarkable professionalism and dedication. The customer service is top-notch—always responsive and willing to go the extra mile to ensure satisfaction. The quality of their products/services is outstanding, reflecting their commitment to excellence. Timely delivery and attention to detail have consistently impressed me. Overall, cisco has set a high standard in their industry, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for reliable and high-quality solutions."
Cisco,Technical Leader,4,Nothing much to write here. Cisco is a tech company and the projects are big and span across multiple quarters. Tech stack is varied and depends on the team.
Cisco,Compensation Analyst,5,"Peers are professional and easy to work with. Enjoyed excellent benefits in a positive, growth-oriented environment. You'll have the chance to make a real impact while enjoying a healthy work-life balance."
Cisco,Software Engineer,5,"Very suportive  management, good training, diverse and inclusive culture. I had a great experience there and would recommend the company to anyone. I worked in the business side, public relations, not IT, so I can only speak to that group, but my impressions of the company as a whole were good. "
Cisco,Digital Marketing Manager,4,Great company culture. Invest in their employees. Plenty of PTO and days off. Fun times with team.Marketing Department is great. Its a large organization so it comes with its own challenge e.g. coordinate with 10 people to get a single task completed.
Cisco,Technical Consulting Engineer,4,"Joined as a fresher offered Good pay, good environment to grow, work with great minds who are helpful. Overall experience of working in cisco has been great so far."
Cisco,Business Development Manager,5,Very professional work enviroment with good work life balance for the most part.  Excellent benifits and plenty of training support is made available.  Biggest downside is that you are ultimately just a number and the frequency and scope of layoffs is absurd.  Very good employees are frequently let go due to re-orgs
Cisco,Customer Success Manager - ThousandEyes,3,"A typical day at work is a lot of meetings and phone calls. There are many trainings and those were good, but not the most engaging. I had a great manager and management puts on a nice face, but I saw many times where they were ugly with people and would flip on a baseless accusation. The hardest part of the job is that there is too much work per person, and not enough resources to allow you to do the job. The most enjoyable thing is all the perks, benefits, and travel opportunities that come with it. "
Cisco,Software Engineer,4,"Great pay and benefitsWork life balance could be betterCulture depends on your manager and teamMost teams are very busy, the problems are challenging and the schedule is tight "
Cisco,Engineering Assistant,5,"WeAreCisco, where each person is unique. We bring our talents to work as a team each day, helping power an inclusive future for all. Here's how we do it. At Cisco, we embody transformation and help our customers excel in their digital worlds. Some may think we're ""old“"
Cisco,Senior Content Marketing Manager,3,"This used to be a pretty great place to work until about the middle of this year. The layoffs in late winter hit everyone very hard, not the least of which being the people who've been here for 20+ years. To get unceremoniously cut loose after that long at one company tells me everything I need to know about the new management group that was brought in. I'm not optimistic about the future. "
Cisco,Software Engineer,4,tech stack maybe outdated. its a good company to coast. They are hiring less. Layoffs is common. people are nice but average. So overall pay is also good
Cisco,Procurement Service Owner,5,Explore endless possibilities for personal and professional development in a dynamic and ever-changing environment. Recognized for your achievements and they offer great opportunity to give back to the community.
Cisco,Renewal Specialist,5,It’s the best job I’ve ever had. Definitely plan to retire and looking forward to a long career here. The flexibility and compensation are the best aspects 
Cisco,Software Engineer,3,Pay is really low as compared to other companies. The one thing which I hate is that Cisco offers higher package (40 LPA)(Fresher) to some selective candidates while 24 LPA to others 
Cisco,Software Engineer,4,Great company with a great culture. Only drawback is the frequent lay offs. Work culture is really good. Benefits are top notch. Overall a great company to work for.
Cisco,Software Engineer,4,"I never encounter toxicity in nearly 5 years at Cisco. Compensation adequate, benefits excellent, stress low. I felt taken care of as an employee, especially when Covid-19 happened. I hold no grudges regarding layoffs, just know that they're going to happen. This is a company calibrated towards sustain, not perpetual growth. Which is wise, IMO. The AI bubble will burst, sooner than most bubbles do, and Cisco should survive it better than most because it's largely built on things of substance. Just don't expect huge returns on RSUs or massive bonuses, and you'll be fine."
Cisco,Account Manager,5,"Best company, best management, policies, and facilities. Opportunity to build a career, learn and develop yourself. Well organized management, employee oriented. "
Cisco,ネットワークエンジニア,5,"The ""year -ramp system"" is one of the Japanese salary systems, a system that determines the annual salary (annual stick) of employees and pays monthly salaries based on that year.。In the annual bar, it is common to pay 12 (or more split) the annual salary.Features of the year stick: 1. Fixed salary: Annual salary is fixed, and the same amount of salary is paid every month.2. Bonus Including: Year sticks usually include bonuses (bonuses) in summer and winter, and these may be paid separately.3. Performance evaluation: The amount of year sticks is often determined based on employee's work experience, skills, performance evaluation, etc.4. Budget plan: For companies, the annual rod system has the advantage that it is easy to manage budgeting for labor costs.The total salary of employees can be planned in advance, making it easier to grasp the annual labor costs.5. Annual contract: Annual rod system is often based on annual contracts, and it is common to review the year when renewing the contract.Advantages and disadvantages of the year's stick: Benefits: Employees guarantee annual income.Easy to predict salary, making it easy to make personal budget planning.The performance -based salary system is clarified.Disadvantages: Because it is a fixed salary, overtime pay may not be paid separately.Salary is difficult to respond flexibly to fluctuations in the labor market.If the performance is insufficient, there is a risk of reduction in salary or non -contract.Companies that adopt the year's bar system will maintain fairness and transparency by setting clear salary systems and performance evaluation criteria to employees.As a result, we can improve employee motivation and efficient corporate human resource management."
Cisco,Front Desk Receptionist,4,"It was fun, I really enjoyed it because I made a lot of colleagues and learned new skills. I don't work there anymore but I love that it was my first job"
Cisco,Compliance Specialist,5,"Great CultureLots of redundancy in sales channelGreat people,  internal processes are antiquated and clunky.Industry leader and respected by the market. Maybe too political at times."
Cisco,Technical Solutions Architect,3,"It's an easy gig since Cisco's name opens doors.  I was a sales engineer, so this is a huge benefit.  Good people to work with.  But these days it's kind of a place to rest in place.  If you don't want to work too hard, and don't want to be at a growing company, and just kind of want to collect a decent paycheck, this is a good place.  But if you have any aspirations, a younger company is really where you should be."
Cisco,Technical Program Manager,5,"I love my job and my group. I have the creative freedom to learn new things and transform my group whenever I want.  Cisco is fairly new to the Agile way of working, and it has been a pleasure to grow with them."
Cisco,Software Engineer Intern,5,"Decent benefits, pretty interesting work, fantastic WLB, generally decent processes, but very team dependent obviously. Decent growth, generally decent all around."
Cisco,Project Coordinator ,5,Great experience collaborating with a wide array of people from various backgrounds. You gain a ton of knowledge from others and there are also resources available to assist on your learning journey certification wise. The only negative thing I have to say is the contract workers tend to be treated very rudely at times by some blue badges. 
Cisco,Renewals Manager,4,"You get far if your management believes in you. If you are placed on a team that a manager doesn’t believe in you and doesn’t want to put in effort to help you succeed, then it’s not a great place, even if you are good at what you do. "
Cisco,Sr. Financial Analyst,5,"Very supportive company who believes in all cultures. Great CEO and management, great work life balance.  Currently working from home but talks of going back into office soon."
Cisco,Recruiter,4,"Management was very supportive, but lacked growth potential. Job was easy, but could be busy at times. No real complaints, team culture was good for being remote. "
Cisco,M&A,4,Good place overall. Some unrest right now after several bad quarters. Not sure what future holds. Good flexible working policies. Decent opportunity for advancement but a lot depends on the team.

Cisco,Software Engineer,5,The best experience you can imagine.I strongly advice everyone to work hard and shift to Cisco.Amazing tech stack and a very understanding manager.The compensation is also very good.
Cisco,Product Manager,2,"1. Constant Reorg - manager changes every 3 months2. Every person is trying to pry on other people's work3. Oldish technologies are worked upon4. Fear of upper management - people are driven by what the SVP says. No questions asked 5. There is no transparency for the org changes done6. People are fired without proper advance notice (Especially in the U.S., also in India)7. Hike is limited to 5% (if you are a great performer but your org is not important within Cisco)8. The people who have spent 15 years here want their people to stay. Newbees are not entertained. PROS: 1. Great learning resources (Coursera, Linkedin Learning, Trainings)2. RSUs Stocks 3.

The company's commitment to technology trends, social responsibility, and sustainability resonates with my values, making me proud to be part of the team."
Cisco,TSA,4,"It has become a bit like IBM. Cisco wants to become a software and service company. Lots of random layoffs even if financial results are good. Political environment. VP and C levels lack of innovation and poor vision, but enormous egos."

Cisco,Network Engineer,4,Great networking work with hands on routing and switching labs if you want to certify. Good benefits and great coworkers in your area but you’ll have a cubicle 
Cisco,Tech Lead,1,"Very bad company, very bad politics, lick you managers to promote. Worst Work life balance full of bad managers and people around you if you decided to work there"
Cisco,"San Jose, CA",3,"1. Every Org. seem to have its own objectives and as a result the company never feels like one cohesive unit. It feels like a group of multiple companies, sometimes even competing for the same resources.2. Total lack of trust between exec. leadership and the teams.3. Teams work in CYA mode rather than support and grow mode.4. Nobody seems to know where the company is headed. One day you could be working on what appears to be top priority and on the very next day you are on chopping block as the priority has changed so drastically that you are no longer relevant."
Cisco,SDET/QA Automation Engineer,4,Very good team memebers and nice place to work with lot of exploruse to learn and grow with new technologies and great learning with the great team members
Cisco,Operations Director,5,Great company - lots of different groups and roles allowing movement without changing employers. Excellent benefits and coworkers. Needs more organic innovation 
Cisco,Finance Analyst,5,Cisco offers the LIFT program which is a 2-year rotational finance program. I thought this was a great way to learn what I liked and didn't like. Outside of the program the company is very supportive to career growth as well.

Cisco,Sales Associate,1,it was ok to work at. I had some challenges learning how to adopt the sales strategies but all in all I was ok at it. At the end it just wasn't for me.
Cisco,Product Manager,5,Great work life balance not a lot of advancement overtime however super stable and excellent benefits. Culture is great as well - could have better lunches
Cisco,System Engineer,4,Big company with the issues that big companies have but the product set is diverse and top notch. The company isn't perfect but I do believe that is a good place to work.
Cisco,"Instructor, Curriculum Manager in Programs , Registrator, Observer.",5,"What is the best part of working at the company?I wotk in the college. And in the school What is the most stressful part about working at the company?To Support people  . In this situation people needs to do job fust.

Cisco,Auxiliary Police Officer,4,Been working here for more than 2 years. Only downside was the working hours. It's hard to adjust since it's a long working hours. Friendly working superiors. 
Cisco,Commercial Finance Manager,5,"Collaborative teams, great benefits package, amazing opportunities to learn & grow, encouragement to move internally, good focus on learning & development, and visionary leadership - are a few attributes that stand out."
Cisco,Pre-Sales Engineer,5,"Always surrounded by people who are willing to teach if you are willing to learn.During my time at cisco, I have been in a wonderful team who taught me customer interactions, technological aspects of products and lots more."
Cisco,Program Analyst,3,"Working for Cisco as a contractor is not the greatest. Employees that are red badgers do the job and others take credit for it (The full time employees). Excellent benefits for non-contractors. They have grandparents leave (as in maternity leave). Days off for volunteering. A lot of training opportunities. Overall, very chill job. There are a lot of management layers that individual performance is not throughly accounted. It also depends on the department that you work in. Other departments are much better than others.  "
Cisco,Team Leader,5,Excellent place for grads to develop. Lots of exciting ongoing projects. IC's encouraged to innovate and explore new ideas in R&D.Career development and mentoring taken seriously.
Cisco,Senior Software Engineer,3,Overall compensation and benefits are good. I've had the pleasure of working in an amazing team and an once amazing org. The last two years have been a directionless disaster with decisions being made by ego and fear.
Cisco,Sales Assistant,3,"It's nice to work Labas, the teams are cool, the culture and the advantages are solid.Few tracks of evolution, a little old management"
Cisco,Technical Solutions Architect ,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?At the time I started Cisco still had a startup mentality even though they were 10,000 strong at the time. Plenty of place to move around inside the company once you get inWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Politics. Specifically make sure you DON""T mess with someone who has designs to be your bosses, boss. however unfortunately you don't know who that is, as it's always  done behind closed doorsWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?It was great. As hiring started to become more urgent, Cisco slowly started to become a modern-day IBM (execs or executive wannabe's wearing suit coats and blue dress shirts with  jeans with tennis shoes ! ) and lost the culture that made it fun and empowered people to speak out (similar to VMware prior to the Boardcom acq),  however the general rank and file people are awesome and very very smartWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?I held 2 positions Presales engineer and Product Manager. In both cases is was a 24 hour drinking from the Firehose to stay ahead."
Cisco,Administrative Assistant,4,"Great place to work. Lots of room to spread your wings. Great team support on the right team. Very supportive leaders. Cisco does LR’s yearly, and it can be stressful wondering if you will be let go.  "
Cisco,Technical Consulting Engineer,4,The work can be stressful and mundane but the team members and managers are extremely personable and helpful. This role is perfect for people who loves to deep dive into one technology and love helping someone troubleshoot their problems. 
Cisco,Supply Chain Specialist,4,"It's nice to work here, but the salary and career opportunity in Europe is quite limited in my area. Good benefits, a lot vacation days, have some RSU, can buy stocks with a discount"
Cisco,Product Engineer,4,Cisco hires on your talent.  Knowing that the groups tend to be ethnic clinging and if your an outsider you may not click.  If you understand that culture then it could be a great place to work.  If you an introvert and not very personable but have a high technical skill you may have difficulty mingling.  Cisco need to recognize that ethnic grouping is detrimental to the culture it wants to establish.  Mixing of the ethnic group is a better way to diversify and raise a culture of inclusion.   Everybody is a fit technically and not all are a fit culturally.    Management is too busy covering their efforts and do not look for excellent's but rather see negativity.   The best part of the job is when you know you are included in the process even if it 2 am where everyone is working together to meet a deadline.   
Cisco,Software Engineer,3,Cisco layoff people every year not by performance even in their best years so no loyalty. It is an ok company to work for but not a long term career builder
Cisco,Major Account Manager,5,Best sales company in the industry. Overall they pay well and have reasonable sales quota. They have ghe best technology and are always buying more companies to add product to their portfolio. 
Cisco,Engineering Intern,5,"Good work life balance, I really learned a lot and the team was amazing, I would recommend working. The offices are in a good location and amazing to work in"

The Walt Disney Company,Reservations Agent,4,If you are passionate about Disney this may be for you. You're immersed in Disney but it is a call center with inherent challenges of call-center jobs. Pay is o.k. Benefits are very good.  The leaders I've had have all been wonderful. All stations are sit-stand; work-out facility in building. Expectations and standards are very high.  Guest surveys and quality monitoring calls can make or break your monthly pay. The company encourages and supports cast members in pursuing professional goals.
The Walt Disney Company,Attractions Cast Member,3,"In this job they want you to succeed with the basic training they give you but are waiting for you to mess up once to fire you, the security team kept reporting us for either looking like we are slacking off to our management even though it wasn’tTheir department "
The Walt Disney Company,Food and Beverage Server,5,I worked Epcot Festivals and it was a super fun work place. It would get boring at times depending on how busy it was but overall not a bad place to work.
The Walt Disney Company,Attractions Host,3,"This is a great part time job for most people.  Advancement isn't easy and seems to go to insiders and people who know people.  But just for fun and a few extra bucks, it's good.  It's hard to describe a typical day because the company is so big, and there are many departments and roles.  "
The Walt Disney Company,Cast Member,5,Fun job but attendance and safety is important. You have to be punctual even a Minute late is considered late. Always be in time and ready for the stage. Benefits for family tickets and discounts make up for the intense work.
The Walt Disney Company,Custodian,4,"The people you come to know both cast members and guests, your very limited to your position anything outside of what your position is not allowed therefore crossing over into another union, workload job training etc. example custodians and food and beverage can’t cross into others jobs tasks. The hours are decent to moderate for full timers, but there is a seniority issue that puts you at the bottom of the list on your work preferences, part timers have no seniority can’t once you’ve applied you have given up your rights on when you can work and what time you can work, also say good bye to your weekends. Also you’ll have to arrive 1-2 hours prior to your scheduled shift to deal with parking at a remote location that will offer you transportation (shuttle) to and from the parks except for the marathon and other events then there’s no transportation available, once in the Disney grounds you must put away all devices, have costume clean and pressed and clear from anything to distracting(stealing the guests eyes) from the magic, you must be ready to work before actually working. After shift you get 20 mins payed walk time to get to your vehicle but no more than 20 mins, and must adhere to guests even after you punch out for the day, you also must be in full costume and can’t alter nor change in either restroom or changing room, can’t shop merchandise nor purchase any food or beverages while in costume, can’t say “I DONT KNOW”. When calling out for what ever reason you must have a valid reason. Sick pay / vacation pay is offered to full timers if your late you can apply your sick - more..."
The Walt Disney Company,Guest Services,2,"Pay was decent, job was fun, leaders were sub-par!! While working for the WDW company it was a lot of fun talking with 1000's of guests every day, but our leaders did not really care about us at all. "
The Walt Disney Company,Attractions Cast Member,5,"Takes a lot to make the magic but love everything about it. Something and someone new everyday. It’s what you would imagine and what you can see online. Tiring, stressful, frustrating. But extremely rewarding if you put your heart into it as well. "
The Walt Disney Company,Bus Driver,5,Love seeing guest happy on the way to the theme park . Coworkers are great and helpful to get you going and learn new things every day benefits are good.
The Walt Disney Company,Steward/Dishwasher,1,One thing I really loved about Disney is the scheduling and how easy it was to contact them and call out or pickup hours. Only bad thing is the management. I didn’t believe when people told me you. ojos get fired simply because a supervisor didn’t like you but it’s true. That’s extremely unfair and unjust. I do not recommend working for Disney. 
The Walt Disney Company,Dishwasher,2,It's a job it pays it has benefits it has ados you can go to the parks for free on non blocked days it's inclusive it's there it pays vacation is very short
The Walt Disney Company,Host,5,great environment and perks. management and leadership care about cast and would recommend to anyone looking for a part-time job in college or recent grad.
The Walt Disney Company,Bellman,5,"I like to meet people from different places and cultures and Disney is a place that lends itself to that opportunity, you also have many training training, and a typical day can be fun and sometimes stressful what I did not like is the lack of opportunity ofEmployment transfer"
The Walt Disney Company,Front of the house ,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The best part of working for this company is everything! It’s magical from day one ! Everyday we learned something new an experience something new it’s never a dull momentWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?There’s is nothing stressful  at this job the most stressful thing is not falling in love with the cast members. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?There’s all types of cultures an the environment is healthy positive an energetic What is a typical day like for you at the company?Walking an greeting spreading our magical smiles
The Walt Disney Company,Character Attendant,5,Truly a magical place where you can move up the ladder and have flexibility as well. Working on the college program was challenging but overall rewarding in its own
The Walt Disney Company,Disney Cast Member,2,"The journey just to get to my location where I worked took 40 minutes alone. Once I got there, in an attempt to cool off I would try to find some shade, since our break areas were outside in the heat. Just so I can go inside to a hot kitchen that didn’t have ac. So, one can deduce I was not happy working for The Walt Disney Company and it’s unfortunate that such a big company doesn’t even provide a proper break area for their cast members. One of my first days they had a GUEST tour backstage. I felt like an animal in a zoo as they watched us in our natural habitat. "
The Walt Disney Company,Sous Chef,1,"I warn anyone who tries to work for the company. They do not care about you or any guests, trust me. They treat their employees horrible and encourage other staff to be ignorant and follow their lead. "
The Walt Disney Company,"Greeter, rides operator",5,"I was on a an ICP program with Walt Disney World Florida and University of California Riverside. It was the best 6 months of my life. I learnt so much about myself and how I handle stressful and difficult situations. I loved doing ""magic moments"" for family and getting to graduate and have Mickey give me my diploma. Team members were great and onsite leadership where very supportive."
The Walt Disney Company,Plumber,5,It is so good and fun to work Disney. It is so good that I can’t even begin to explain how good because it is just so amazing and magical and full of tarts
The Walt Disney Company,College Placement,5,"Doing the Disney College Program was a lot of fun, would definitely recommend it to all university students as a fun job and a great company to have on your CV."

The Walt Disney Company,Health and safety production assistant,5,I learned a lot about working on film sets in a health and safety capacity. The management was great to work for as they were well organized and treated their team with respect. 
The Walt Disney Company,Warehouse Operative,3,"It took a few years  to get a job offer at the company however, people were great to work with. There were little to no chance of progression unless you were liked by management or very lucky. But  overall it was a good place to work."
The Walt Disney Company,Security Officer,4,Overall Disney is a decent company to work for. Pay could be better but the overall benefits cannot be beat. If you work at it there are growth opportunities 
The Walt Disney Company,Walt Disney World,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Some of the people and getting the fantastic PERKSWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Having to work and putting a smile on your face, when with the wages you make don’t cover your bills . It would be really great if we could make a good salary and live comfortably, but I’m sure Disney’s GREED gets in the way of that!!! Giving is much better than receiving, you should try it sometime!!  Some of the people that I worked with had to sleep in their cars, because they couldn’t afford paying rent and eating and paying the rest of their bills!! Paying cast members a real living wage could possibly boost morale, but  I’m sure this company won’t ever try that!! Try paying rent, car insurance, car note, money for gas,utilities and save a little something while making $15 to $20 and hour, DO THE MATH!!! Oh yea! I almost forgot, we have to eat, tooWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Most of the people that I worked with were kind, some weren’t, like on all jobs!!!!  that goes for the managers, also!! What is a typical day like for you at the company?Clock in, go to pre- meal meeting.  Greet and seat guests, then do our side work until the end of our shift"
The Walt Disney Company,Advanced Line Cook,4,Job can be fun and rewarding.  Management can be a bit overbearing.  There is a lot of opportunity for advancement.  If you are coming from a lot of outside experience it will be quite an adjustment.
The Walt Disney Company,Enterprise Program Manager - Global Security Control Center,3,"Limited flexibility and low compensation, considering the vast reach of the organization. Limited involvement of managers, to the detriment of employees. "
The Walt Disney Company,master locksmith,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Get to meet people from all different backgrounds.  Learn many different skills and how to to them safely What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Make me a better person with different types of people.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very  clean nice and safe environment to work What is a typical day like for you at the company?Mostly busy at times but very enjoyable
The Walt Disney Company,Merchandise Coordinator,4,"advancement is really difficult and takes a long time, people with less experience get hired in from outside the company to the higher positions sometimes."
The Walt Disney Company,Front Desk Concierge,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Not a lot. Just the few tickets given for friends and family. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management doesn’t ever back you up. No matter what they claim the guest is always right. Don’t bother working for them. It’s a dead end job What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Environment is hot and they discriminate against people with tattoos and piercings. They now allow very small tattoos but they don’t allow you to be yourself. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Listening to guest complaints constantly. Helping guests resolve issues. Getting yelled at by guests then management siding with the guest and then even though you follow the rules the rules go out the window depending on the manager.
The Walt Disney Company,Food and bev,5,"Non stop work. Lots of hours available, management was not the best. Coworkers were great. very fast paced environment. Schedule flexibility was good since there was always hours to pick up or give away"
The Walt Disney Company,Front Desk Concierge,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The work culture is really magicalWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?How to be efficient in time managing different types of guestsWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Helping together and learning each others mistakeWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Guests interactions and enjoy life
The Walt Disney Company,Sales and Solutions Specialist,5,"I loved working here, the job was super simple just helping people figure out how to use their app to buy tickets and book attractions. Hands down easiest job I ever had. Pay was great and weekly and my coworkers were very helpful. "
The Walt Disney Company,Housekeeping,1,"You have 16 rooms to clean daily, you're not always at your resort, they send you to others resorts and your not showed how to do anything at them. The management is very poor. I learned at this job certain team members didn't have to do anything,  and if they did they always got help. Certain employees were over looked for a job that they had all the qualifications, but they gave it to someone that didn't know the job and had to be trained. Never knowing where you were going to be. The best part of the job was getting discounts."
The Walt Disney Company,Retail Merchandiser,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?They care,  I have a disability and they went out of their way to accommodate me.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?An irate customer. Its hard trying to calm someone down nicely.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Pleasant.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Open register.  Make sure there are enough supplies.  Customers come in you might help them find something.  Ring up and package items."
The Walt Disney Company,Sales & Solutions Specialist,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?As far as call centers go, the training has been the most organized. The overall culture of the company ranks very high among other industries. It’s almost stress free! It’s like being paid to have fun. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?For me, the most stressful part is having to shift bid as frequently as we have. I’m in the reservation center and there’s ongoing hiring. I need a more stable schedule for my children. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The culture and environment are like family. Disney is big on diversity and inclusivity. What is a typical day like for you at the company?I go to work, do my job, I’m kept informed throughout the day via several mediums and I log out! There’s a lot of autonomy which I LIVE. Hardly any micromanaging!"
The Walt Disney Company,Ride Operator,5,Started working at 5 or 6 am in the morning and doing 8 to 10 hours or more during holidays and getting overtime from 2016 til covid hit in 2019 - 2020 and I got to make the guest happy and I enjoyed working with the characters as well.
The Walt Disney Company,Supervisor,4,"Working at TWDC is a dream come true for so many, but you have to be quite aware that it is also an office and a Corporation. Is quite demanding and competitive; also the career oportunities are few and the growth is even worse."
The Walt Disney Company,Intern,5,Great learning experience. Great opportunity for networking. Lots of options to grow after internship and looks great on a resume. Would love to work here full time if given the opportunity. 
The Walt Disney Company,Reservations Agent,4,Get to make magic and help guests plan their Disney Vacations. Great medical benefits and park perks. Hours can be tough as it is a 365 day call center. 
The Walt Disney Company,Travel Agent,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Helping families and travel agents book great Disney vacations.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Call center environment with very strict performance management resulting in extremely stressful situations where you could lose your entire monthly bonus incentive. This could be for something as minor as a single poor survey sometimes caused by the persons misunderstanding of the rating structure. When the person said you’ve been wonderful please send me to your survey and you get a poor survey. You would think there could have been some consideration since they can confirm by reviewing a recorded call,  but there was no flexibility.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment was pleasant and comfortable. There were dress codes and requirements based on many of Walt Disney’s guidelines which relaxed over the years. We were allowed to wear non-cargo shorts and other business casual wear. Then after Covid there were no restrictions. Cast Members were coming in sweats and pajamas or worse. This seemed like an indicator of the attitude of the employees(because they were no longer behaving like cast members.) I’ve heard it’s gotten even worse from friends that are still there.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Sign in on time or get dinged. Take as many calls as possible and meet all Performance Management requirements. Take a break, take a walk around the building, breath, repeat. Often there was “”voluntary mandatory” overtime. You could schedule - more..."
The Walt Disney Company,Professional Chauffeur,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits are the best anywhere What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working  all kind of hours on a daily basisWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Most of all very friendly people as well as great country sceneryWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Working 12 to 15 hour days with plenty of food and drinks provided
The Walt Disney Company,Quick Service Food and Beverage Cast Member,4,"At some points, I would consider this the best job I've ever had. My leaders often backed me up in guest disputes, I got park admission, and I enjoyed the work. On the other hand, as an intern, we were often treated as less than human, overworked, and deeply underpaid. For those of us with car payments, phone bills, or any cost of living besides food, it was a struggle to live off of each paycheck."
The Walt Disney Company,Disney Vacation Club,3,"While the pay is decent, the atmosphere is very shallow and micromanaging. I found the disability accommodation process degrading and not helpful. Management is constantly shifted and changed."
The Walt Disney Company,Dishwasher,5,I love it. Coming to work everyday was the best at Disney since I love the company and the products as well. Thank you Walt for creating this company.
The Walt Disney Company,Background Technician,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great co-workers, fun benefits.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Scheduling is sometimes a bit crazy.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Team oriented. Partnering with different lines of business every day.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Fun. Always something happening, something different everyday."
The Walt Disney Company,Entertainment Technician,5,"I was with disney for over two years. I was fired with cause over something I did that was dumb. However, I believe that thing should have been a reprimand at worst. Unfortunately for me, despite utilizing the Union grievance process, Disney's decisions are often final. The grievance process isn't really impartial, and EPCOT entertainment tech management can be a bit unyielding. They don't have the best reputation across property. But if you're a good boy, girl or other, then you shouldn't have any trouble. Management is varied. You may never even meet the same managers I had. Most of mine were good, but there was at least one bad apple. However, many people make a career at Disney World. There's some opportunity for advancement, but that was never my bag. "
The Walt Disney Company,Manager,2,"feels like a small company, with little technology and low organization.  many long time employees resistant to change.  leadership needs to be more open to feedback."
The Walt Disney Company,"Custiodian, greeter, sales. driver",1,The cast members are not supported if there is any issues - everything is based on who you know - pay is horrible when I left the company after 8 years people coming in to my department were making 10 cents less than I was and pay was low especially for working graveyard shift and the machinery used for the position
The Walt Disney Company,Concierge,4,A great way to get started on your career in hospitality. Must have thick skin or learn to have thick skin. Fun benefits like park access and discounts 
The Walt Disney Company,Merchandising,5,great opportunities to grow and learn. Lots of training. Lots of support from current as well as new staffs. There are positions just to help be support to new employees. 
The Walt Disney Company,Data Maintenance,3,"Before pandemic it was a nice place to work. Good benefits, specially the medical insurance and the eye insurance. Were very  affordables. Hotel and cruises discounts. Free park entrance tickets "
The Walt Disney Company,Character Performer,3,"Takes a lot out of you to provide the type of service they expect day after day and not see it reflected in your pay. Meanwhile the company has been siphoning money from the theme park sector which is super ""profitable"" to pay for anything and everything but fair wages for their employees."
The Walt Disney Company,Attractions Cast Member,3,"Perks are worth it but the management was horrible, they will fire someone for attendance before they fire anyone for “misconduct” so I guess that makes HR trash too"
The Walt Disney Company,Sales Representative,1,Disney doesn't support  people  who have a disability  and they do not hire anyone with disability.                                                      
The Walt Disney Company,Bus driver full time,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Free admission to the parks and restaurant discounts What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The point system they use to intimidate you with that never go away What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Poor at best everyone is overworked and underpaid but you have Disney on your resume What is a typical day like for you at the company?Very very stressful and the guest treat you like dirt. People constantly complaining and they refuse to follow any rules cuz they think they don’t have too
The Walt Disney Company,Walt Disney Bus Driver,5,"Driving Bus for Disney was a dream of mine. My husband made that happen for me. Life changes, circumstances brought me to Georgia. I REALLY miss NOT working for Disney. I worked for Disney 5-1/2 wonderful years. I Enjoyed every day with guests, cast members and mangers. "
The Walt Disney Company,Merchandise Associate,3,Management the only thing important is to do the paperwork clean no incidents. This is a reason they don’t consider our issues with the guess. No matter what they support the guess no the employees
The Walt Disney Company,Disney Cast Member,5,The work place is great it can be busy and some days it can be slow depending on how many orders we get each day. I’ve learned a lot from loading to unloading trucks which was my favorite part of job. The management was always on top of everyone making sure we’re all working safely. The hardest part well there really wasn’t any to be honest. I enjoyed working for Disney because it was the best place to work at for my first warehouse job.
The Walt Disney Company,Hosekeeping,5,I like to work in Disney because all people are responsible for their work
The Walt Disney Company,Disney College Program,4,"Unfortunately, I got the short end of the stick for my Disney College Program and was placed in Quick Service in Magic Kingdom. While the other DCP participants were nice, some of the PT/FT staff weren’t as nice. My only issue was the hours. There were times where I was working 7+ days in a row and the shifts were over 9 hours. "
The Walt Disney Company,Technical Program Manager,3,"Honestly - you really can't match Disney's benefits. The people are wonderful, and they really value their employees...but, sometimes you hit a roadblock. There's limited internal growth. "
The Walt Disney Company,Professional Chauffeur,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits are the best anywhere What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working  all kind of hours on a daily basisWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Most of all very friendly people as well as great country sceneryWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Working 12 to 15 hour days with plenty of food and drinks provided
The Walt Disney Company,Writer,2,"I went out of my way to discuss some job strategies or make a connection with an HR staff person who was apparently employed there decades. Despite two different phone conversations no interview or ""leg up"" for any job. Whatever job I applied to despite the fact I had some background resulted in no interview or consideration. If you read the want ads closely, they specialize some jobs to the point nobody can qualify except ""insiders"" who already work for Disney. I cannot speak for the purely entry level jobs and maybe if I lived in Florida I may have applied to some of these openings, but when you have a bachelor degree, you do not necessarily want to move cross country to work on the ground floor. Can only speak from my experience, this employer despite being large is like all the rest. You are only a number. Do not trust the outward appearance or the vacation lens that many will get duped into thinking they may be a good place to work. Getting an interview or consideration seems very remote with this place."
The Walt Disney Company,Cast Member,5,"I worked at a store location before they closed down. It was retail so there were definitely some challenging moments, but our management always handled it with outstanding professionalism. My favorite part of working with the company is all the memories and connections I made throughout my time working there. "
The Walt Disney Company,Quick Service Food and Beverage Cast Member,5,"The experience working with the Walt Disney Company is very magical and happy, highly recommend.  There is a lot of career growth within the company ."
The Walt Disney Company,"Anaheim, CA",5,"I worked at a few places before working here at Disneyland in Anaheim.  Honestly, I wasn't much of a disney fan at all. Just a few movies I watched with my Grandma when I was younger. I moved to the OC and needed a job. To this day, from day one, there is no job out there like it. I have left and gone back but regardless of where I go. Which degree I earn. There is NO PLACE that makes me as happy. Of course there are people there that make isn't weird, like any job out there. But there is a bigger few that really do make it worth everything. Great perks, get to make memories for families and yourself and others. The magical way you think it's like..it's better. And it's coming from someone like me who hated Disney before. I am forever grateful for getting hired and doing my dream job. You can travel, and just.. just work there. You won't regret it. If you don't like it, you can transfer departments.  Opportunities are literally endless. I just can't give this company enough praise. "
The Walt Disney Company,Photopass Photographer,4,"I was a part of the Disney College Program. I took photos of guests at Epcot. I loved the job. I had so much fun. The one problem was the management. This was many years ago, so I’m sure the managers are different now. But there were times I was treated poorly by the photopass management at the park. "
The Walt Disney Company,Cast Member,3,I worked there an international cast member in the parks. It was great place for a short term. If you don't need too much money but have fun it is the place to be :) 
The Walt Disney Company,Distribution Operations Manager ,3,This was a good place to work for me and my family mattered however the company is not really invested in their employees and there is quite a bit of nepotism.

The Walt Disney Company,Baker/Cook,1,"Chefs are too busy to help, CAs think they are gods and Other cooks are rude and talk down to others. Hours are terrible depending on what park you get put in. You get treated like a cog in a wheel and if you don't work fast enough or put on a fake smile you get scolded. If you want to be a cook/baker work anywhere else!!  "

The Walt Disney Company,Student Intern,4,We would go to work and work crazy hours with no benefits and could work crazy hours back to back. When we would get a day off we were all so exhausted and you would get sick from how much you were working
The Walt Disney Company,Ride Operator,4,Job was fun and made a lot of friends but it does not give you a good life/work balance. In some areas you HAVE to work your shifts with only 3 trades to off a year which is insane to me.
The Walt Disney Company,Outdoor Food Server,5,Coworkers are AMAZING and so caring. Every person learns differently. Everyone has a different background. Overcoming language barriers with guests and coworkers is challenging but rewarding as you learn as you go. 
The Walt Disney Company,Sales and Solutions Video Specialist,4,Can be fast paced at times but the benefits and company itself are amazing.  Hardest part of the job is the insta unity as far as sheiks and shifts go. Disney is ever change aging which is great in most aspects. But it makes it difficult to have a steady work life balance. 
The Walt Disney Company,Intern,5,Diversity could be improved. Great leadership and mentors. Pay is great and workload really varies depending on your role. Extremely competitive to get an interview. 
The Walt Disney Company,Specialist,1,If you like Disney go work for universal and buy a season pass. Management is clueless and have no idea what their doing. They treat horrendously and just expect you to never question there judgment.

The company felt like a well oiled machine, in which you felt like a small but essential cog.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Being a foreign national, for me, it was always the work visa situation. On that the company has no input or control.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?I felt I fit in well with the environment and culture. It’s not for everyone, but those I worked with, for the most part we’re pleased to be there.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy. Lots of collaboration.

The Walt Disney Company,QA Engineer,5,I tested mobile devices daily.I learned a lot technology for Disney.I liked management.Work culture was good.The hardest part is to automate the process and analytical results.Remote job was enjoyable for me.

The Walt Disney Company,Fiberglass eliminator,5,Most enjoyable time working for Disney was working on the rides and finish the work with quality work ethic. I work during the day and sometimes I work the third shifts. I also work on the tram
The Walt Disney Company,Hotel Sales Associate,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?I loved the culture, the work the people.  I was so sorry to leave but their was a loss in the family and I went back to Canada for family support, It was nice to hear that the door was always open if I wanted to return.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?I worked at DRC so the having to book a park before arrival was trying.  Happy that is not longer the case. Hurricanes and people panicking that they were going to be kick out of their hotel.  Lots of explaing how to use Genie.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?I loved the ability to work from home . And I always enjoyed meeting my new team.  I was a top performer so I got to pick my own scheudle.  I  always enjoyed helping the new people in their role and I got to learn new things from them as well.   I enjoy seeing how they are doing on facebook. I don't agree with 2 days in the office once was enough or 4 day work week 1 day 5 day work week 2 days in office.What is a typical day like for you at the company? 11:30 am to 9:45 PM   always on the phone with a booking or modification.  I would take breaks when I felt like and always did dinner at 6 PM and not 2:45pm when I am not hungry.   Alway took my call last call at 9;45pm did ACW after a call and fill out the other application before getting to the next call.  In office got their early to say hello to cast mates, make my tea, clean my desk set up equipment and start my day."
The Walt Disney Company,Commercial Bus Driver,5,driving people  from hotel to the parks. I learned a lot from zone and he helped me become a better driver. I learned how to handle myself and deal with things. 
The Walt Disney Company,Attractions Cast Member,4,"Every day is different, and you get to meet people from all over the world. Every day presents opportunities to help families and guests make lifelong memories, which can be special. Management can be hit or miss. I was very lucky to be in an area with overall amazing management.The public can sometimes be difficult to work with. Some guests can be rude or downright nasty. There are many wonderful guests that you’ll encounter too though, and those guests are the ones who will stay in your memory and remind you why you enjoy the job.It is difficult to maintain work-life balance, particularly when it comes to scheduling. I could only schedule my life 1-2 weeks in advance, which I did not like."
The Walt Disney Company,Photopass Photographer,5,Going in  to work I always have a smile on my face. I enjoyed talking to customers and taking pictures of them. It was always a fun day at Disney. I learned to have fun and to look on the bright side of working. 
The Walt Disney Company,Sales Specialist,3,"Working at the DRC or Disney Central as it is now called had some great perks if you love Disney. Special discounts on products, free tickets to the park, hotel stays, etc. However, the culture of the work environment is lacking and you do not feel supported by upper management. Lower management give off the vibe that they do not like their jobs and there is no work/life balance. Disney wants full availability and scheduling was always a problem. They tried to motivate staff by parties and incentives, but the real problems that cast members had were never addressed. It could be a great company if management only listened to the general basic needs of the employees. "
The Walt Disney Company,Retail Sales Associate,2,"Attendance policies are terrible and management isn't great. You are definitely just a number to them. Note, I didn't work in the park. I worked in DTD "
The Walt Disney Company,Guest Experience Manager,1,"The company is great to visit and be a guest at, but once you're inside the company even at the top the compensation is awful compared to normal companies everywhere else, and the expectations are insane for the compensation. They push everyone to the max and destroy the magic within that once existed. You'll find yourself in a worst state once you start here than what you could have ever imagined. I worked 14+ hour days was the expectation sometimes 6 days a week. This company will take everything you have and give you some park tickets."
The Walt Disney Company,Manager - Park Operations,3,"This review is specific to working at the Disneyland Resort. It can be a fun place to work and provides great job experience, especially for those just out of college or only looking for hourly or part-time work.However, the higher up in the company you go, nepotism and lack of diversity play a much bigger role. There is also a horrible work-life balance. There are a ton of wellness programs, but you don't really get a chance to use them because you are always working. Budget cuts are always being made, so everyone is understaffed, tired, and overworked. And in Operations, there is a culture that CELEBRATES the lack of work-life balance. Managers brag about how many hours they put in instead of seeing that it isn't healthy. I've heard Operations VPs talk badly about the support employees who work Monday - Friday like they are lazy. It's pretty bad."
The Walt Disney Company,Wireless Architect,4,"My days are constantly changing as we move from one wireless project to the other, often discussing working on designs for many in same day. Adapting to chaos and a constantly changing work landscape is key to working for Disney in the Resort environment."
The Walt Disney Company,Project Manager,4,Deadlines were sometimes challenging but overall an enjoyable place to work. There are a lot of contractors (myself included). The contractors do the same work as people on staff but sometimes were treated as second-class citizens.
The Walt Disney Company,DCP,4,"Cut short from Covid, had a good time. Not enough hours being offered but was able to trade and pick up. I miss working there but I don’t think I can go back due to small salary. "
The Walt Disney Company,Hôte propreté,5,"I loved working at Disneyland Paris, for my first work experience it was just magic, I would still like to work in Disneyland Paris if possible."
Merck,"Apprentice, Risk Evaluation & Adaptive Integrated Monitoring",5,"During my time at Merck, I have learned a lot about the company while having the chance to enhance my skills. I came to the company through a partnership which they have hold for some time now. The program which introduced me to Merck is called ""Year Up"", thanks to this opportunity i was able to land my internship which lasted a period of six months which now transitioned to an apprenticeship. I really love the work culture and how welcoming everyone is, no matter the questions or doubts people will help you here! For someone who comes from a different background that is no issue here because this company is really big on DEI. In terms of personal skills, there are many opportunities which you can pursue in order to enhance those, the one thing always required is that you can be fully transparent to those who you need to communicate with. This company also gives a lot of independencies to their roles for which a certain degree of responsibility is required. Other than that, it is really a nice place to work for and learn from others. I am really happy to be here. "
Merck,Operations Specialist,3,Long hours and no room for growth opportunities. Management is clueless and seem to not care about their people. The pay and benefits are good which is probably why most are still there.
Merck,Executive Director,3,"Frequent reorganizations across many organizations. You always have to make sure you’re being savvy with your relationships and making sure you hook your wagon to the right people with influence, which can be exhausting. However, that is most pharma companies… so relatively speak, they are better than others. Great benefits, financial packages and work/life balance "
Merck,Associate Specialist,2,"At least in my department, management has high expectations to keep promises made with very little basis in reality, putting pressure on the workforce.  Requires a lot of flexibility to keep up with shifting demands."
Merck,Consultor especialista de productos,1,"What is the best thing to work in the company? The classmates and multidisciplinary team What is the most stressful of working in the company? Lack of balance, unnecessary unnecessary pressures, low qualification of the bioethics of the company, few economic conditions and somethingRisk, lack of empathy and commitment to the worker How are the work environment and culture in the company? Little ethical and unfair, unsatisfactory in all aspects in your case, how is a typical day in the company? Lack of leadershipBy intermediary and higher positions small qualified level"
Merck,Senior Scientist,4,"Not too much to complain about. Busy when working then u go home. 25 days of vacation, but u normally don't use it all up. How u feel really depends on the local environment. "
Merck,Director,1,I found Merck to be unfair to me. Rather than working with me to address my concerns they just terminated my employment. Since then I have asked other Merck employees about their experience. They all felt that Merck causes a feelings of humiliation. Terrible place to work.
Merck,"De Soto, KS",4,"Company has been investing in the site so the outlook is good.Current major shack up in management, time will tell if it's for the better or worse.Decent pay with good benefits and good time off/vacation time."
Merck,SR. Engineering Specialist,3,"Have over 10 years of experience accumulated work at the West Point site in multiple buildings and working for numerous Supervisors.  I have had to learn to be extremely flexible,  resilient in adversity and accommodating in my roles.I have met people that will be my friends for life. I have also found that you must have a certain mindset to fit in with the culture that is prevalent. "
Merck,"Rahway, NJ",4,"The work is challenging and rewarding, but many in upper management are a bit behind in their ways compared to other companies. Company does require on site attendance, even if all work is virtual."
Merck,Specialist HR Operations ,5,"Typical day interaction with team, individual projects, problem solvingWhat learned - share knowledge because it makes your team seamless. Management varies but most are quite good Culture- excellence is expected Hardest part of job - Sustained performance Easiest part of job - working with great st all levels of the company!"
Merck,Director,4,"Culture can be challenging.  A lot of churn with repeated ideas and strategies that start and stop over and over.  Lots of politics.  But overall, lots of opportunities to learn and grow.  Important to proceed with a positive attitude and try to tune out the noise."
Merck,Process Development Engineer,4,Interesting and rewarding work opportunities but there is limited career growth. The site uses a lot of contract employees and there aren't a lot of opportunities to transition to permanent employee positions. 
Merck,Account Executive,2,Great company gone down hill due to exits of talented people and replaced with less experienced novices. Pipeline is drying up and few quality replacements coming. 
Merck,Product Manager,5,"Merck is a great company to work for because they remain focused on the main objective of producing drugs that save lives. This compassion for the patient transcends to how they treat employees by valuing the work we do, ensuring we have excellent working conditions and compensating for good performance"
Merck,Bio-Technician II,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?They pay well and operate in a professional manner. There is a lot of room for growth, but no pressure to move up if you like where you are.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The department I worked in most of the time I was there was very busy and sometimes you had to work a double shift without too much advanced notice.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's professional, but also friendly and  inclusive."
Merck,Chemical Operator,4,I enjoyed working here and my coworkers were great at training and super helpful. Everyone really wanted to see you succeed. Terrible management though. Constantly lied to your face and it was always someone else’s fault. 
Merck,Stagiaire ingénieur,5,"Positive points: Manager involved, supervision and training of impeccable internship, good working atmosphere, compliance with the personal time ratio/Restocse Protickets"
Merck,Operateur,2,"No organization, unheard of in aseptic production"
Merck,Director of Marketing,4,"The mission of the company is superb.  It's tremendous to be part of an company that helps so many people. There are a lot of really smart people in the company mixed with some people that are there to collect a paycheck.  For the very most part people there are incredible.  The pay and benefits are very good.    The work is complex and can be very rewarding. Programs and projects are lead with a purpose or aspiration.   Structure, hierarchy and box checking are finding their way back into the culture.  I had a lot of colleagues that were collecting their check.  Even though they wanted to do more or wanted more for the patients and  other people Merck serves, they weren't allowed.   Decision making and action are incredibly slow in certain parts of the business.  Incredibly slow.  When I was there we called it the 'speed of Merck'.  The environment generally avoids conflict. That combined too much work and lack of real priorities in the day to day, chokes curiosity and creativity.  Internal proxies (leaders) drive strategic decisions instead of customer and competitive data. This leads to stale thinking and continuing to do things the same way as they have always been done.  Current leadership puts emphasis on rigor and consistency.   Less emphasis on customer (although they say they want it) and being curious and nimble.  Biggest watch outs include: 1) Lots of underutilized talent- mainly because either traditional thinking or processes don't allow for people to contribute fully.  It's frustrating and prevalent.  There are too many layers and many leaders don't know how - more..."
Merck,Operations Manager,1,Upper management has limited visibility on any issues occurring and does nothing to change them. The managing teams are poorly structured with a sink or swim culture where no one supports one another. There is no personal development no matter how long your tenure. Hard working people never get credit. Especially those on off shifts. 1st shift always steals the credit and gets the “I was there” points. This is to name a FEW.

Merck,Maintenance Technician,4,"Good place to work. Has the same issues most larger companies have between management and employees, but over all good job. They place large focus on Safety!"
Merck,Consultant,5,"I work from home and on site as needed.  I find the staff to be very friendly and supportive.  This is one of the lowest stress jobs I’ve ever had.  My managers have been really down to earth and genuinely good people.  I don’t see the drama and office politics here.  People are polite, but direct.  We can get really busy, but I find the work to be manageable.  I am not an employee, but all of my interactions with Merck personnel has been positive.  My pay is fantastic and most of the jobs that are posted have decent salaries.  After 3 years, I still feel motivated and happy to work here. "
Merck,Senior Principal Scientist,4,Great benefits include:  pension/annuity; free college advisory services for your kidsCons: way too many SOPs and too many committees to get anything approved
Merck,Technician Level Three,1,What is the best part of working at the company?People want to leave after getting in. Management issues and problemsWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Trying to keep things running What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Party and cliques so unless your apart of this culture you will not grow and develop.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stale and lack luster no ability to even savage things. Because a lot of no advancement and no new skills and abilities can be learned and you become stale.
Merck,Research and Development,5,A very great environment with lots of incredibly talented scientist and engineers. They really are a very ethical company and provided plenty of opportunities to explore your interests. 
Merck,Operations Technician,4,"great place to work, culture is great and easy going. Would like to have more opportunities for growth. Pay is okay, hours are good, time off is amazing."

Merck,Bioinformatic Analyst,5,I worked as a student co-op remotely for a year. It was a rewarding experience.

Merck,Order Management Specialist,1,Not a secure job for a long term.Not challenging.Low salary.Good for entry level.Low workload therefore good work-life balance.Nice workplace culture.
Merck,Associate Principal Scientist,5,The pipeline of products is good. Pay is okay. People are very good. 25 days of vacation per year and end of the year week shutdown is very good. Health insurance is not good.
Merck,ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR,4,"I recommend Merck but recommend staying away from the Manufacturing Division (MMD). Advancement within that division is contingent on working yourself into the ground, being tied to the operation nonstop and never truly separating from the work. You can establish work/life balance yourself and that is generally accepted, but your career stalls. Outside of MMD there are plenty of opportunities for career growth AND work/life balance, and you don't need to sacrifice salary (it's often actually higher). There are too many levels of management and they over-complicate issues that are already complicated, making them more difficult to solve. There's an expectation to do everything at once and fix everything at once (or explain why you can't, often several times to different audiences, wasting a regrettable amount of time and effort). The overall effect is that it is almost impossible to focus and make improvements. You spend a lot of time just trying to keep your head above water and avoid complete disaster. Job satisfaction is infrequent - at the end of the day you're just happy to have survived.The teams are stellar and you will work with brilliant people who genuinely care about one another, regardless of division this is consistent across the company and is the company's biggest asset. Unfortunately they rely on people being basically miracle-workers on a daily basis. If everyone wasn't extremely talented it would all fall apart. When I step back and think about it, it's crazy that we can actually get the work done. There's a lot of stress here. A LOT. If you can cope/manage - more..."
Merck,Accountant,1,"The companys culture is too toxic. It cant support its own employees initiative. Also, leads are not that good in handling people. Work load is also a concern"
Merck,Associate Director,5,Pay compared to other Pharma is lower.  5 weeks vacation to start is a great benefit.  There is a lot of OT during the busy periods.  Most groups are very flexible to work in.

I really love the work culture and how welcoming everyone is, no matter the questions or doubts people will help you here! For someone who comes from a different background that is no issue here because this company is really big on DEI. In terms of personal skills, there are many opportunities which you can pursue in order to enhance those, the one thing always required is that you can be fully transparent to those who you need to communicate with. This company also gives a lot of independencies to their roles for which a certain degree of responsibility is required. Other than that, it is really a nice place to work for and learn from others.

The Coca-Cola Company,Customer Service Technician,1,This company was a great place to work back in the day. Now the company is riddled with third party owners whose vision is anything but employee friendly. Management creates the most toxic environment possible. Nothing is ever good enough.
The Coca-Cola Company,Merchandiser,2,"Very physical, constant lifting and frequently at odd angles and areas that make proper lifting impossible. You drive your own vehicle, and only get paid between stores. So if you have to drive an hour to your first store, and end at that store you wont be paid mileage and definitely not clock time. I start at six and have to drive 40mins unpaid, unmileaged, so i have to get up at 5 and leave immediately ptherwise i have to get up at 4:30. Days can commonly be 11-12 hours though if you really put your back into it you can het off “early” though you will likely not have much energy left. Sales managers like to order way too much cases even though there is already mountains of product, so you have to move around 15 cases just to get to one then move it all back again. You are constantly moving cases around since you’re limited to working on a cart or pallet. This job is not chill, so if you think you’re getting a mellow job don’t bother. You likely won’t be able to take days off as the rest of crew will resent you, it’s a corporation so yeah they own you as far as scheduling. "

AbbVie,Lab Technician,2,"Working at AbbVie was a challenging experience for me. Unfortunately, I encountered several issues that significantly impacted my overall job satisfaction.One of the most significant drawbacks was the hostile work environment. It often felt like there was a lack of camaraderie among colleagues, and the overall atmosphere was not friendly. This made it difficult to build meaningful professional relationships or feel supported in my role.The demanding hours and stressful working conditions further contributed to a negative experience. The expectations were overwhelming, and it often felt like there was little to no work-life balance. This pressure led to burnout, which was not ideal for anyone looking to maintain their well-being while striving for success.Moreover, the management at AbbVie left much to be desired. Poor managerial practices hindered personal growth and professional success. It was disheartening to see how inadequate leadership affected team dynamics and individual performance.While there was an expectation for employees to grow and learn quickly, the rapid pace often left little room for fully developing skills. This created a sense of frustration, as the pressure to keep up with demands overshadowed the opportunity for thorough learning and mastery.Absolutely a profit over people company."

AbbVie,Associate Director,4,"Large company with many brands to work on for career growth. Must be willing to network/drive your own career. Managers are promoted based on results, not on their coaching abilities. "
AbbVie,Manufacturing Technician IV,3,It’s really hard to get promoted from within. If you are an internal candidate applying for a position they won’t even allow you to interview even if you have the qualifications if the  position is too many grades above your current position.  If you work on the manufacturing side it’s almost impossible to move up. People get promoted more because of who they know more than what they know.  It’s poorly managed by those who instill an atmosphere of fear rather than support or encouragement. People are poorly. Trained and its grossly understaffed even though the work load and production increases yearly. You are rarely noticed or appreciated for your accomplishments as you are for your mistakes. It was not always like this but unfortunately the bigger they became the worse it got.

AbbVie,"Scientist I, Analytical Chemist",4,"What is the best part of working at the company?The best part of working for Abbvie for 32 years was the diversity of people who worked there.  Also the wide variety of jobs available within my degree and abilities.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The most stressful part of working for the company is the cuts in full time employees over time.  The unrealistic expectations of management that fewer people produce more scientific data in less time with fewer resources.  The employees in my area (drug development) were burning out at a faster rate.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The environment was becoming more stressful.  Management turnover was happening faster.  Each new VP had a new management style and new organizational chart for the R&D area.  New ways for us to work harder with fewer FTE's and less resources, while still producing ""world class science"".  The overall culture within my department was mostly pleasant.  Our lower level managers understood the pressures and tried to help where they could.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Most days involved working on assigned stability analyses of drug products.  I spent about 50% of my time in the analytical lab and 25% of my time performing writeups of the data I produced.  My data was directly imported into FDA filings.

AbbVie,Internal Auditor,2,"- Regarding the IA management , they are on the older side and perhaps in a coasting phase until retirement. This situation doesn't inspire high expectations for significant changes or innovation.  - Regarding audits, the audit process hasn’t evolved much over the past 10 years, and there’s a perception that the primary goal is to make the IA’s management look good. Significant budgets are allocated for audits and global travel, yet most audits don't seem to add a lot of value to the company. also the culture at the internal audit function is so toxic. Management knows that but not willing to do anything about it. - When it comes to the rotation program, here’s the lowdown: As a senior, you’ll be required to rotate into a different business area after 24 months. Sounds enticing, right? But beware—it can be a bit of a trap. Most likely, you’ll find yourself rotating into finance or some other function that might not be known for a good work/life balance or a good culture/work environment. Most good auditors end up leaving the company before their 2 year mark.  - If you are in the city, the drive to Abbott park (where internal auditors sit) is going to be really rough. You are expect to be in the office for 3 days or more and they are keeping a close eye on attendance. Not a whole lot of flexibility.  - AbbVie, once heavily reliant on Humira (which contributed a large portion of its revenue), now faces a significant shift. With Humira’s exclusivity lost and its revenue share went down significantly, the future might not be that bright for the next 5-10 years. They might - more..."

After years of hard work, all-nighters, and yes, a lot of fun, college is over and your career is starting. Along with excitement, you’re probably feeling a bit nervous and maybe even wondering if they picked the right person for the job. Before your first day, read through these quotes and remember you wouldn’t have gotten this far in the first place without a very specific person – you! "
AbbVie,Contractor,1,"I've never worked for such toxic place that on the surface, appears to pay ""well"" but in reality makes people work 60+ hours a week.There's a follow-up to a follow-up to a follow-up and the managers are the most uptight group of politicians.  It does not matter how well you perform.  If you don't kiss up, you will never get promoted.  I suppose if you're a woke and the 13%, you'd get a promotion in no time.The culture is the most toxic one I've worked at, and many don't make it past 1 year."
AbbVie,Marketing learner ,3,A typical day includes concurrently planning multiple events and collaboration with others.

Pretty much can practice work life balance, doesn't have to do work on weekends except for urgent matters you need to settle within the dateline. Work process quite lengthy which you need to key in everything in system and route for approval from multiple stakeholders before you can finally submit your application to Health Authority which sometimes might delay your work. Have to attend too many meetings almost everyday and don't have much time to do work during 8 hrs of working hours and still need to complete your task according to dateline given. You will get overwhelmed with too many tasks and juggling between your core works and never ending meetings. Leadership team is very demanding and no room for discussion. High expectations to new joiner to deliver job without guidance and training from immediate superior. Must be independent on figuring things out on your own. Blaming culture is part of their routine. Always take contractors to cover their shortage of headcounts and dismissed you without prior notice. "

AbbVie,EHS Manager,2,"Worst company I’ve worked for so far. While employees are accumulating functions to cut costs and working around the clock, senior leadership is flying jets to their meetings. Very hypocritical company. On top of it, EHS is just to show, the company is not really worried about it. Big incidents tend to be hidden or only disclosed months and months after."

AbbVie,Production Technician,1,"Toxic environment and not just the chemicals. Safety is poor. Management is self interested, supervisors willing to cut any corner or hang who they can to advance. Leadership at a departmental level is incredibly weak and shortsighted. "
AbbVie,Petaling Jaya,4,"Its a fun place to work, great colleges and helpful teams.  But the upper management seems to have the archaic mindset. Most of them have no empathy. "
AbbVie,Inside Sales Representative ,2,"It is a good stepping stone for inside sales, but MP impacted the team with favoritism and gossip. Metrics and KPI’s have an easy to moderate level of obtainment. I thought highly of Abbvie until I working with this team. I would choose a different role within the company before recommending this team. Pros: Abbvie benefits and perks are outstanding. "
AbbVie,Specialty Sales Representative,1,Abbvie is too big to make adjustments. Starting pay around 80k. They keep lowering target commission while setting growth goals above 20% per quarter. Stay away until they right the ship. Oh and they just down graded cars or make u pay 400 a month for an suv.
AbbVie,US Field,3,"Pros: Some nice people here, usually willing to help you if you need.  Great pay/benefits and you learn a lot.Cons: Many in leadership/senior leadership positions…only care about profits and company image. Inflexible to change for needs of employees, including allowing remote, hybrid, part time, etc options.

ConocoPhillips,Mso,3,The company is great but the work hitch sucks. It's 10 days on 4 day off and you are on call for the first 7 of those 10 days. Not a very good schedule if you have a family. It's a very hard company to get hired on as an employee because they hire contractors as contingents to the company and hire from the contingents when Conoco has an opening. There are usually a lot of contractors in front of you so chances of becoming a full ConocoPhillips employee may take a long time.

ConocoPhillips,Warehouse Manager/Inventory Analyst,2,Job was meaningless Too many ridiculous policies. Tripping over dollars to save a nickel.

ConocoPhillips,Senior Staff Engineer,2,"When oil and gas price is low, very political and better only tell them what they want to hear and only if you have to comment and you will be fine.

When in Regulatory I worked very closely with the RRC to help implement progressive programs to do with helping to build/develop a pilot programs for production and semi-well testing state requirment reports to transmit data electronically instead of manual entry.

ConocoPhillips,Operations Supervisor,5,I would go back and work with ConocoPhillips anytime. It was an exciting project to be a part off. ConocoPhillips encourages the development of it's people and rewards those who pout in the effort. It's shame the project had to come to an end.

ConocoPhillips,BUSINESS ANALYST,3,I was lucky to work with some great and intelligent people who I learned a lot from. I met some great colleagues and friends. Sometimes could be busy and stressful
ConocoPhillips,Executive Project Secretary Operations Department - Period,5,To be honest I can't recall one bad day working with ConocoPhillips. It's that type of environment where you wake up happy each morning looking forward to see you coworkers and get on with the intensity of your job. Each week we had meetings with contractors and after meeting we had coffee and snack morning little chat and back to work.  The most enjoyable part was when we completed a stage of the job and went on site with the engineers and other staff to see the product and/or part being installed or transported to the site if it was offshore. After such success was celebration time. There was no hard day when you are working with supportive and great coworkers and with a great profesional boss.

ConocoPhillips,Human Resources / Visas Coordinator,5,"More than a work experience, it was a well taught class on organizational behavior and culture. In a country where evil became customary, this company came to show everyone who worked there a different and productive way of working. We learn that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Leadership, teamwork, focus, rapid response to emergencies, forecasting/anticipation, became responsibilities distributed to all in a balanced way. All colleagues who worked with us continue to talk to us since the COP left Angola. ConocoPhillips left the country but did not leave our hearts. As an HR, I can safely say that the COP has changed my being both professionally and personally. I dream of being part of it again. Me and everyone else."
ConocoPhillips,Mess Cook,3,I was never let off the boat when I was supposed to be. All of the paid leave I gathered I was never allowed to use. And even though I have the training and experience they make you start at the bottom and work your way up. Other than that it was a decent job
ConocoPhillips,Safety and Health,4,"Human Resources at Corporate Office is trying very hard to offer good benefit and culture.

However, he treated people that worked for him as if were his untrusted servants."
ConocoPhillips,Chief Steam Engineer,4,Upper management seemed to be a bit overwhelmed and snappy at times.  The older people had a very hard time with 14 on/off.  There was a bit too much change at times with people constantly moving around.

ConocoPhillips,"Bartlesville, OK",5,A typical day at work would be 8-16 hrs for a non-exempt position. A typical week would be 5-6 days. Like many companies; it sometimes was who you knew not what you knew that got you where you wanted to go. Even with that I enjoyed working there and developed many skills with opportunities.
ConocoPhillips,Commercial Coordinator | Event Planner,5,ConocoPhillips is by far the best company I've worked for! I've worked in corporate America for over 30 years and I've never seen a company that truly put their employees first.  The CEO is extremely down-to-earth and it trickles down throughout the company.  I pray this never changes.
ConocoPhillips,Oil and gas operator,5,Well managed company with appreciating forecasts for positive growth financially. Encouraging personal growth through experience and education.Environmental stewardship is an expectation that is adhered to company wide as is safety.

ConocoPhillips,I had four different titles,5,All in all I enjoyed my work and different rolls while working at ConocoPhillips.  In retrospect when I inquired about what I needed to do to advance I often didn't receive very good information.  The company culture was great and changed for the better during my career.  I was and I am still very proud of the fact that I worked for this company.
ConocoPhillips,Contactor,4,"Our team is small and volatility of layoffs and industry change is a negative factor for stress. Good balance of work/life, great pay. Overall good job experience, but working as a full-time contractor for more than years and have been contralto disappointed about opportunities to get in at company. Contactor and freelancer beware."
ConocoPhillips,Engineer,2,"Good place to start your career, but opportunities for advancement limited. Large company so things tend to move slow with lots of bureaucracy. Interesting people to meet along the way. "

Best Buy,"Consultation Agent, Geek Squad",5,"Great place to work! Consulting is easy, lots of down time. Co-workers and management are very helpful. You deal with the occasional dumb customer questions but that's not a big problem."
Best Buy,Merchandising Associate,3,"Overall a decent and easier job, kind laid back. Management can sometimes be awful. Expect full time work to be done in part time hours and no help. also if you’re not a favorite you will get avoided at all costs by management. Hit or miss. "
Best Buy,Advisor,4,"Good pay for what you do. Company offers great benefits. Typical retail job where meeting goals can be highly unrealistic at times. That's about it. Not much room for advancement, and when you do advance - it's just a title change. Absolutely nothing special about working at Best Buy. Just another retail spot to collect a paycheck before the doors close."
Best Buy,Consultation Agent,3,Taking walk-ins plus triple bookings and we have to sell new laptops? No thank you. I would have enjoyed this role more if it was focused on fixing people’s problems rather than the hybrid tech support/sales role it actually is.
Best Buy,Advisor,5,I’ve been working for a year started off as a seasonal and I am now a VPL I wish the pay was better since we have to know so much and have to stay on top and do more then most work places 
Best Buy,Advanced Repair Agent,1,You will never get promoted through hard work it is only via being a sycophant. Geek Squad culture is an excellent vibe but it's not worth being jerked around
Best Buy,Advanced Repair Agent,5,"Great area to work at. I've learned a lot from Geek Squad, it's a good starting position if you're looking for an entry level job. I've enjoyed working here"
Best Buy,AT&T Mobile Expert,4,"Great company, most employees like to work and learn and the management is pretty good. The roles aren’t clear in most aspects though which grows tiresome. "
Best Buy,Engineer,5,"Working at Best Buy is a rewarding experience for several reasons. First, the environment is dynamic, with a fast-paced, ever-changing atmosphere that keeps things exciting. I enjoy the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of customers, each with unique needs and questions, allowing me to improve my problem-solving skills and expand my knowledge of technology.Best Buy emphasizes teamwork, which creates a supportive workplace where employees can collaborate and learn from each other. The company invests in its employees through continuous training, which helps me stay up-to-date with the latest tech trends and enhances my ability to provide expert advice to customers.Another aspect I appreciate is the company culture, which values both employees and customers. Best Buy promotes a positive work-life balance, and the leadership team is approachable, making the work environment welcoming and inclusive. The employee discount is also a nice perk, allowing me to explore and experience new gadgets and electronics that I’m passionate about.Overall, working at Best Buy allows me to combine my love for technology with excellent customer service, while fostering personal growth and a sense of accomplishment through helping people find the perfect solutions to their tech needs."
Best Buy,Retail Sales Associate,3,It’s alright but many hours are giving for new hires we need to learn I find it hard to if my hours are just 4 hours a week or less it doesn’t make sense but ok 
Best Buy,Sales Manager,1,"Terrible overhead management that favors suckers and doesn’t allow for progression; if you want to grow in a business, run far away from Best Buy as fast as you can."
Best Buy,Sales Advisor,5,Easy work as long as you are do as your told and perform well. really have to push on the credit cards / memberships. my personal management team really do understand life circumstances if you happen to call in
Best Buy,Advisor,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Employee discounts and accommodationsWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?There's never anywhere near enough help, retail is a blood soaked nightmarish hellscape if you don't like people. Sales, while not commission, operates like the sleaziest of car salesman. Goals are completely unreasonable. Pay is literally based on how much leadership likes you. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?No help, leadership constantly whining about sales numbers, and when there aren't customers they'll give you the most ridiculous busy work. Get used to cleaning. You'll also get constant training about the least important aspects of the tech you're selling because they only care about up selling and not actually educating people on what to care about. Best buy only cares about numbers and if you aren't meeting them they love to remind you how much you suck.What is a typical day like for you at the company?They laid me off with about 5000 other people for literally no reason."
Best Buy,Product Flow Specialist,5,What is the best part of working at the company?It feels like being part of a BIG Family What is the most stressful part about working at the company?It can get boring once in a while but still a fun experience What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Amazing. Simply amazing. It is a blend of every culture you could think ofWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?There is a schedule that everyone needs to follow and we all try to communicate with each other
Best Buy,Supervisor/Manager,5,Great place to be good benefits. Retail can be challenging but the management at the Midland location are very professional and top notch. Fast paced 
Best Buy,Advanced Repair Agent,3,The job was great and fun in the beginning. However there have been a lot of changes throughout the company that made it not worth working there. Everything is getting pushed from the higher ups with no voice from the employees. Times have changed since 2016
Best Buy,Secuirty Officer,3,It was an easy job for the most part. Management was supportive with stopping theft. The job itself functions more as a door greeter then asset protection.
Best Buy,Warehouse Associate,3,"good starter job to work at. the job isnt too hard just unload trucks, stock shelves, and pick online orders. reason i left was because i didnt get alot of hours"
Best Buy,Warehouse Associate,4,Productive and very safe environment to work in also with very good opportunities to be able to step up and build a career out of it.Pay and benefits are also great.

Best Buy,Shift Leader,5,"It might just be my particular store, but I have a lot of fun working at this current Best Buy location. What makes it so fun is the staff available that are all very capable and compassionate people that are easy to talk to… In addition, the managerial staff they are very willing to make changes and deviations in order to best match every employee "
Best Buy,Area Manager,5,Very healthy place to work. Seems to have a good culture environment. Management is very helpful especially being newTo the organization. Everyone understands we are there for the betterOf the company
Best Buy,Sales Associate,3,the workplace environment is good. pretty fast paced during the holidays. Otherwise it’s a very laid back and good job to have. managers are also very friendly 
Best Buy,Installer/Technician,1,Leaders in the company have no leadership ability’s. Leaders hire who sucks up the best. No knowledge required. Coworkers are normal people and great to work with.
Best Buy,General Manager,4,The local team is great room to improve around support for local stores and need for diversity in upper management. Like most big corporations they continue to have the staff do more but not increase salary to do the workload 
Best Buy,Cashier,5,Wonderful place to work! Very great staff and everyone works well together! It’s a great environment to be and everyone treats you like family. Definitely love it.
Best Buy,Wireless Sales Associate,4,Lots of stuff to do in a fast paced clean environment. Get to meet lots of people and talk about technology and solutions. It was a long time ago but I liked working there. 
Best Buy,Sales Advisor,3,"I enjoyed working for Best Buy for a few years, being my first job in sales it allowed me to grow as an individual and grow my knowledge in the technology industry. Co-workers were the best part of the job, however when you start working by yourself basically 1 man running the entire floor.. it gets hectic. Plus constant employee cuts, not even supervisors were safe from these. "
Best Buy,Appliance Repair Technician,3,"The pay for service jobs with Best Buy is very good. However, due to the constant restructuring to try and squeeze every dollar out of the business means your position is always in danger of being dissolved. "
Best Buy,Sales Specialist,3,"It can be a fun place to work at and there is always something new to learn. The past few years corporate managers seem to constantly change salary rates, and eliminate then add job positions. It’s a solid place to work for younger folks who just need a part time job to get by while in school or what have you, but there’s no guarantee no matter how good of a worker you are that your position won’t  be eliminated and you will be let go as a full time employee"
Best Buy,Customer Service,4,"You are held accountable for sales numbers, and they help you to achieve those goals. However, the pay is horrible with not much room for growth. the environment is okay if you get in on people’s good side. very political environment "
Best Buy,Experience Manager,3,"Best Buy has some good benefits like tuition reimbursement and you get a decent amount of PTO as a full timer. I generally liked working for Best Buy, but you need to be willing to work at different stores to get that next promotion and along with that comes with a total change in team culture and environment. Some stores have bad leadership that can make the overall morale very poor. As a salaried manager responsible for sales, work/life balance was also poor because you spend every weekend working instead of with your family (this is more a retail issue and not specifically Best Buy)I would not say the job is difficult, but dealing with the people can be. However, the people can also be the most rewarding part of the job, considering most of my closest friends are people I met while working there. I left the company because I got promoted to a salaried manager position (closer to home and $25k/year raise from supervisor!) but the management team I joined was working to breed what I considered a toxic work environment. There is a right and a wrong way to do things, and ultimately it was time to go once I was waking up and dreading to go to a job I was once excited to be at. All in all, it CAN be good and was for me for 5+ years. I would say for most, retail is not endgame and I would definitely recommend Best Buy for young people fresh out of high school, and not for anyone looking to build a career. "
Best Buy,Geek Squad Agent,4,"Watching all of my coworkers get laid off or forced to switch to lower paying roles; including top store performers really rubbed me the wrong way. The message that was sent was “welcome to Best Buy, don’t work here for too long or you’ll get fired!”. Absolutely killed whatever culture was left."
Best Buy,"Consultation Agent, Geek Squad",4,"Decent place to work on customerservice skills with troubleshooting laptops, phones, and desktops. Pay is alright since it is minimum wage. Only thing is that you would need to have alot of patience with customers who don't understand tech or if they get upset."
Best Buy,Warehouse Worker,5,Great place and good work very simple and easy but also great experience to learn more about fulfillment and processing while having a great team behind me
Best Buy,Consultation Agent,2,"Working at Best Buy (specifically Geek Squad) is fine for the pay you get. But they unfortunately cap you, and you won’t be going above it regardless of what they promise you.If the store is busy, sometimes managers will come back and ask you to go out and work on the sales floor.The huge problem is with moving up in management. To move up first, you have to become a shift lead. You get paid only $1 more (only for the hours you’re scheduled as a lead), but are expected to have the same duties as a manager full time.You want to move up past that? Good luck. Because if you aren’t related to anyone higher up, or aren’t good friends with a higher up, you’re probably not going to move up."
Best Buy,Sales Associate,5,Very fast paced work place. Loved working with the customers. Management is very flexible and feel like they are on your side. Proactive type of management. 
Best Buy,Ok job  while in college,3,"I worked in the car electronics department. My manager was over the  camera department. He knew nothing about car electronics, yet he would constantly berate me on my sales. I outsold my entire team every week. All they cared about was selling credit cards."
Best Buy,Home Theater Specialist,3,"Worked here for 16 years and make a little more than people being hired in my role. The company doesn’t care about tenure. They have recently asked us to do more, while not paying us more. They up our sales goals constantly and even if we hit them, get no bonuses or pay bumps. Yearly “raises” are a meager 3% while inflation and local cost of living goes up 7%+ each year. Changing primary systems to save money but not flushing all the bugs out before launching it. "
Best Buy,Warehouse Technician,4,"Everyone was friendly while I was there, overall great place to work. Management was kind the rest of us and knew what had to be done and helped is get it done."
Best Buy,Inventory/Merchandising Supervisor,5,"Best buy was always a great place to work. The team felt like a second family and everyone had each other's backs. They had a motto that really was true; ""have fun while being the best""The only downside to best buy is their pay. They pay much lower than most other retailers for similar work.

Best Buy,Sales Associate,1,Cool place if you can make friends to pass the time. Otherwise the company seems to be going downhill. It's okay as a summer job and can teach you some important life skills. 
Best Buy,Sales Advisor,3,The pay was very good for retail and the management seemed to care when I was there. There were a lot of strange customers tho. They also liked to put employees against each other at some points for selling memberships.

Best Buy,Automotive Technician,3,"Underpaid, overworked, no real training for the position vs what they want you to do to customers cars. Previous skills and knowledge a plus, but the pay cap will scare you off. You can make more on your own. "
Best Buy,Computer and Tablet Specialist,4,"employees might not like the fast-paced retail environment, which can be stressful during peak times. There may also be frustrations related to shift scheduling or the demands of meeting sales targets. Limited upward mobility in certain positions could deter long-term commitment. Lastly, employees might feel overwhelmed by the constant changes in technology and product offerings, leading to a sense of instability. Balancing these factors ultimately shapes their overall experience at Best Buy."

Best Buy,Warehouse Supervisor,4,"Great bosses, but corporate constantly changing things and making it harder to provide good experience in store.  Work hard, and you’ll get rewarded well."
Best Buy,Customer Service Representative,5,Great job and good benefits. Fun work environment. The only downside is having to ask people to apply for credit cards and push the insurance on people to meet sales. 
Best Buy,Geek Squad Consultation Agent,3,"Better than most other retail positions, especially with the employee discount. You will get yelled at by customers and there's very little downtime, but it can be engaging. "

Best Buy,Sales Associate,5,Cant complain one of the better jobs. Only issue is the sales aspect on shoving credit cards and protection in peoples face for any little purchase.  
Best Buy,Customer Service Representative,3,"Could not get full time, had to take other people's shifts in order to get full time hours. Five your number to supervisors to call you if other people call out."
Best Buy,Sales Manager,1,"After 6 years with the company I got a letter in the mail saying I was terminated....no communication, nothing from management. Honestly a blessing in disguise because the new OMNI GM has ego issues but yeah...weird behavior from a company that pays their customers to sign up for a store credit card but okayyyy "
Best Buy,Computer Sales Associate,4,"Literally loved working here, totally LGBTQ+ inclusive and understanding, will work with you if you need to transfer stores when you move (mostly), nothing really went wrong here at all and I would go back in a heartbeat if I could. Only cons were unreliable/unpredictable hours, internal hiring instead of fair opportunity hiring, a 'smidge' of favoritism, hard to reach/unrealistic goals, and occasional skeleton crews."
Best Buy,Geek Squad Agent,1,"We were told to lie to customers, if we did not we were yelled at. The pay is terrible, best buy is a horrible place to work at and will make you poorer for it. "

Best Buy,Forklift Operator,5,The system they have is ran by a point system and if you miss 2 days without sick pay you get fired . The management is very professional and so are the employees. Very clean work space . If you can stick around it is a very good job to stay in .

Best Buy,Sales Representative,5,"It was a fun and supportive working environment, where collaboration and teamwork were highly valued. The manager was incredibly flexible and trusted employees to manage their time effectively, as long as the work was completed on time and up to standard.

Best Buy,Sales Representative,2,you walk around and listen to older coworkers complain about how they dont get paid enough yet all they do is walk around and dont help customers suck it best buy
Best Buy,Sales Representative,3,"Great first job when starting out in your early career life. Depending on management and the other coworkers, work life can be an absolute blast. There will be those that will get under your skin whether that's management, coworkers, and customers. Don't let it phase you can keep moving forward. In my experience, they don't typically promote unless you have some form of higher learning or show some type of superman/superwoman like abilities. I know people still working for Best Buy that have been there for 20+ years. You either will excel incredibly, coasting (getting the bare minimum done), or crash and burn. You have to really not try to crash and burn. "
Best Buy,Sales Associate,5,Very cool to work at Bestbuy helped with networking with other and make very good connections with others. Co-workers are super nice and help lighten workload
Best Buy,Customer Service Representative,4,Good people good atmosphere! Pay is average for retail… Much more fun to stand and sell electronics then work at Walmart for the same pay. Professional management! 
Best Buy,Customer Service Representative,1,A culture of bullying is nurtured at Best Buy Canada. The hardest part of the job would be living up to management expectations and the most enjoyable part is making a customer happy. 
Best Buy,Geek Squad,4,"Did a bit of everything. Geek Squad the best. Gained useful skills across departments. Great training w/incentives, but typical corporate limitations."
Best Buy,Sales Advisor,4,Starting at 15.00 is hard now a days to make it in the area. If the pay was higher I would love it. Managers will consistently have daily conversations with you if you’re not making your goals and it’s annoying. Your not making sales and then they keep taking you off the floor to talk about it knocking you further down.
Best Buy,Senior Administrative Specialist,4,All administrative work that a best buy store needs to do. All the customer service after sale that you do not normally see. Recruiting new staff for all departments.
Best Buy,Computer Sales Associate,5,"They give you lots of training to help you learn about the products and how to assist customers, so you feel prepared for the job. I think working here helped me get a grasp on the whole corporate sales process, good place to learn."

DOW,Product Manager,5,Great experience with one of the largest and best companies in the industry.    Can spend your whole career there or leverage it to a role with another company where your experience will allow you to excel.   
DOW,Supply Chain,2,"Employees working at plant are mostly related, eg. Husband/wife, neighbors,  brothers,  sisters  and various related family members.   If your not ""connected "" you will struggle to succeed in your career growth.   Incentatives are driven through company sponsored lunches and occasionally a t-shirt or jacket distributed as a thank you for job well done.  Monetary pay distributions and  bonuses  limited to once a year.Employee safety is low priority.  Leadership mentality is just get job done with company profitability being top priority.  Most enjoyable part is end of day.Would not recommend employment at this company to anyone."
DOW,Cateringmederwerker B op locatie,5,"What is the best thing about working at the company? Dowable work, every day after me, to work to work.

Everyone?Day differently, check all orders well and prepare everything in a row. Communication with each other, and start."
DOW,Logistics Operator,1,"When they say Dow is about family, that is a lie. When it comes to employees, they definitely pick out their favoritism there and don’t value the employees who work there butts off. Some people you work with like to sit around all day while you are the one out there working. Overall, it was an okay place to work. Money and Benefits were awesome but the management there needs some improvement. Take care of the ones who actually want to work and not the ones who like to kiss and make up to management. "
DOW,Customer Service Representative,3," Enjoyed working here for the most part.  Nothing really stands out. It wasn't the best company and it wasn't the worst.  Great Benefits and Good coworkers. Some favortism but all in all, not a bad  company."
DOW,Process Operator,2,"No true team effort amongst workers. A lot of selfishness and jealousy toward the ones that do work hard and never shy away from challenges. Problems and issues are not always address and if you were to ""Respectfully"" voice opinion on laziness and workers passing work loads off on purpose, you will be targeted by workers that are clickish, petty, childish, and envious to plot and twist things up to tarnish ones name . I come from the field contractor side and everyone works together and shines together. For people to play with a person's name and lively ness is cowardly. Everyone has a voice , a opinion, and matters ..You truly have the right to Respectfully speak but it's bad seeds mixed in with the good everywhere you go it seems ..My job is to work as a team, safely, get along to shine together as one and go home like we came . Stop using others as shields to skate along and actually learn the job.  It's not a competition, never was ."

DOW,Assistant Manager,1,"Should have left so long ago, no growth, upper management's divided with the staff who has dedicated themselves to the mission whole heartedly and doesn't get treated with respect."
DOW,Head Operator,5,My job as a head operator was to keep the building and the people safe while being productive. I learned how to operate several types of equipment and was able to expand my troubleshoot skills.Had no issues with management.everyone was treated the same.The hardest part of my job was knowing how to handle emergencies. (We did IRL drills to help prepare for them).Solving a problem.  
DOW,Administrative Assistant,3,"Not much room for growth at all. Ability to grow is still very much a seniority way of thinking versus actual abilities and what someone has to offer. Not flexible at all in regards to life and if things come up. Couldn't really take lunch breaks. No clear direction in job duties and easy to have nothing to do at all, because managers may not want to delegate anything."
DOW,Purchasing Specialist ,4,No micro management. Excellent salary and company contributes 80% of medical aid expense. I’ve since left and heard the culture has changed and has become toxic. When I was there we were like family.
DOW,Planner,5,Good company with good guidance and a fun working atmosphere.International environment very educational.If ERL is put less pressure on organizing internal activities.These seem to count if you want to make promotion - regardless of how well you do it in your daily work
DOW,"Anlagenfahrer, Operator ",2,"Work done is not recognized, company does not take any advice on the chef, you can't have a grant when eating, no food at the weekend"
DOW,assistant experimentation,3,"The management is correct, the atmosphere is good.Diversified work and with trips to write reports, customer contact you have to like the theme of phytos"

DOW,Operator,5,Love the job and people.  Great career job that has fulfilled my expectations for the last 27 years.  Would most certainly recommend this job to anyone who is ready to make a long term life commitment.
DOW,Porteiro de Edifícios,5,"What is the best part of working in the company? The company has always done training in all exercises always had contentment and security has never been the company that expected from its employee the magic of the work exercise but the exercise of training.(Dow is an example of a company.) What is the most stressful part of work in the company? There has never been, I always had training, performing tasks. How are the environment and the work culture in the company?How is a typical day for you in the company? Typical?Every day new experiences."
DOW,Research scientist,4,"Employees are very technically competent. The culture is great, inclusive and respectful. Good work life balance. Accommodations for flexible schedules."
DOW,Quality Control Technician,3,over the years have had questionable leaders who acted as though employee happiness/ mental health was an unimportant factor and best treated with more work and stress
DOW,Engineer,5,Spent 17 years at this wonderful company. Much recommended- a true family companyVery good for young engineers or anyone at any stage of their careers 
DOW,Supply Chain Rotation,5,"The APAC supply chain rotational program is one that offers fresh graduates a good perspective on Dow supply chain. The two year program puts you through two rotations and have opportunities to be mentored by ""program alumni"" or decision makers. Generally a great path to be on for an accelerated career in supply chain in or outside Dow."
DOW,Operator,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?You will become an well rounded experienced operator. Most of the people there are friendly. Learning the process in making desired products were super easy to me.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lack of communication, working with experienced people who lack in safety awareness, and working with people whom you cannot trust. ( Management who engage in bad gossip, and smile in the coworkers face after they bad mouth that employee.)What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Pretty old refinery, quite a bit near misses found, overall very diverse.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy, everything did manually."
DOW,Maintenance Engineer,5,"Dow hires good people and has good policies and procedures in place. The Carrollton plant has a variety of processes and technologies so it is never boring. Other than the location, Dow Carrollton is a top tier employer."
DOW,Technician,3,hard to advance at small sites unless you know someone. hard work is rarely rewarded. when you are really good at what you do they keep you in the same position an barely give you a raise. if you want to get promoted you have to get permission from your leader and they have to the right to deny your promotion if they still need you to work for them. 
DOW,Program Leader,4,Good job but stressful role. Dow safety standards are difficult to navigate and feeling of gotcha moments around every corner. Corporate Facilities team is very supportive.
DOW,Human Resources,3,"Very unpredictable, frequently outsourcing or downsizing jobs. Pay and benefits are great if you are willing to give up your life for your job and don’t mind worrying if you will even have a job about every 2 years."
DOW,Production Engineer,4,"Good company to grow if you are willing to change locations.The benefits are good, but in my experience the home balance was almost absent.HR/payroll almost unreachable. The company culture for inclusion and also the training plans."
DOW,Process Technician,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Great place to start but has a very high turnover rate due to poor management. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Everything is Engineer driven and procedure driven. Get caught without a procedure for any reason and get written up. Tons of overtime with no rest. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Terrible. Everyone makes a different wage and management is subpar at best. Toxic culture with little room for advancement. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Batch process that is engineer driven. Very fast paced and busy.
DOW,Senior Improvement Engineer ,5,Provides good training for the work. Also the work life balance is great. Pay is one of the best in class in the industry. Also you can learn more and connect with people
DOW,operaio chimico farmaceutico,1,Very stressful work is always missing staff and private life and a dream .. Continuous changes of shifts .. they know continuous sacrifices and little gratitude .. I worked 3 years. And I ran away
DOW,Commercial Excellence Specialist,3,"This job paid WAY more than a similar job elsewhere would have and had me located in a place with a low cost of living, which was nice, but the culture of care is all for show and it's nearly impossible to move up the chain unless you spend literally all of your working time networking. Different teams/leaders create different environments, but regardless, there is little, if any support from your supervising chaing of command for your personal growth and career aspirations, meaning there was a lot of turnover from folks looking for opportunities on other teams and at other companies. Only way to get an actual raise or new responsibilities is to find a new position, be it internal or external."
DOW,Finance Manager,4,"I loved working for Dow while it lasted. The company has flexible work arrangements and employee benefits are good. Working with teams locally and internationally was great. Most are very open, easy to work with individuals. If you are not mobile and you want to remain in Switzerland, Dow is not for you. It is difficult to find a foothold as 100s of roles have been moved elsewhere for the past 10+ years and Switzerland is one of the most attractive location the company has. From a work perspective, Dow is too eager to box up even middle level roles not taking into account how it affects other functions. There is loss of knowledge and employees at such levels are often no longer encouraged and enticed to think outside the box."
DOW,Accountant,5,"Extremely good place, super culture, supportive and transparent management.Regular career discussions are held with definitive steps to work on. All festivals are celebrated with great enthusiasm and great food and participation."
DOW,Supply Specialist,4,"Good athmosphere to work, inclusive, some oppurtunities are possible to change work within the company if you showcase and push your competency. Compeseatiom could be better. "
DOW,Intern,5,Lots of opportunities to learn! Great internship- co-op program for engineering majors!  Great people to work with. People are always willing to help and give advice for future career!
DOW,Director,4,Great place to work. Enjoyed working there except for the travel demands but company culture is a great asset for the company.  The company cares for their employees.
DOW,Process Operator,2,"DOW is more interested in winning awards for inclusivity than ensuring good products are made and procedures followed.  They no longer give operator tests, so now they tend to hire people who don't have the mechanical appititude or minimum strength for normal daily tasks.  There is lots of back-biting and very little supervision after 4:00 PM"
DOW,Sr. Development Engineer,4,"Although my experience goes back to some 10 years ago, I found Dow Chemical a company that enabled me to develop myself. They offered a good salary and took employees serious."
DOW,Research scientist,4,"Employees are very technically competent. The culture is great, inclusive and respectful. Good work life balance. Accommodations for flexible schedules."

DOW,Operator,4,"Working as an operator for dow pays very well, but the swing shift schedule is terrible for you and your family. Plenty of opportunity for overtime if money is your priority. "
DOW,Supply analyst,4,"Interesting place to work, challenging atmosphere much autonomy. Raceplan if there is ambition to look for them.Company with international and prestigious friction"
DOW,Maintenance Technician,1,Decent money but not worth all of the issues. They expect you to be multi craft but won’t pay you as good as other places around for one craft. Management has no maintenance background or interest in learning. They force OT all of the time so good luck having a family life. 
DOW,Senior Instrumentation Engineer,5,Work culture is awesome. Put people first over process. Give utmost importance to safety. Better work life balance. Room for all. I learnt a lot here.
DOW,"Instandhaltung, Betrieb, Projekte, …",3,What is the best thing about working at this company?

DOW,Package Handler,5,"Didn’t force you to work over, management was cool, they gave us bonuses,  plant was clean,  work environment was great, you could move up to different positions."
DOW,Valve Technician,3,Good money. Work way to much for me I had three bosses and every time you wanted to get something done you had to do through the chain. Will not miss.

DOW,Batch Maker,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?The pay is good, this company use to stand out amongst other companies in the area but the pay has become stagnant and other companies are catching up quickly! What is the most stressful part about working at the company?All the unnecessary paperwork and training for things you don't do on a daily basis but have to know so the company can pass on liabilities to production workers What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Use to be family oriented, thank you rewards for a job well done, holiday meals and gifts! Now it's Thank you emails and continuous quarterly emails of how well the site is doing(but nothing for the actual workers).

DOW,Supply Chain Manager,4,Good place to learn and enjoy work life balance. Overall great place to work with design your day (work from home or office). Feels like if they did return to office it would not be as enjoyable
DOW,Process Technician,3,"Overall a good company to work for, not many opportunities to learn from more experienced operators due to the high turnover rate caused by low pay and sometimes bad leadership. Not many opportunities to move into new roles. "
DOW,Technician,5,Learned a great deal from my direct chemist. Was introduced to the research and development side of the chemical world. Was only there for one year but I take the lessons with me. 
DOW,Chemical Operator,4,Ok place to work. Good benefits. Lots of responsibilities and are generally overwhelmed with work. Rules are complicated and hard to decipher. Good people 
DOW,Operator,5,It’s a good place to work. The benefits are ok and pay is great. There is a bit of OT but not terrible. Most of the jobs are pretty simple and repetitive
DOW,EHS Technician,5,"I enjoyed my time working for Dow. Outside of the occasional bad coworker, Dow is a great place to work. The pay and benefits are excellent. Though I left to purse other opportunities, I’d consider returning."
DOW,Assistant Techincial Sevice Engineer,5,Pros :Great working culture Good Work life balanceLow stress working environmentGood Exposure to the IndustryCons:Doesn't have a good promotion oppotunity
DOW,Senior Scheduling Specialist,4,"Great work life balance, good benefits, competitive pay and bonuses. Poor mentoring plan for new employees. Poor org structure. Leaders often have 40 people under them, in my opinion this is not ideal, no matter how experienced a leader might be. Blows my mind how much poor performance is tolerated. Overall, I am happier here than my last place of employment due to work life balance, even though my career progression and overall learning has slowed down immensely."
DOW,Production Engineer,3,Great place to learn quickly as a chemical engineer. Great opportunities to lead. Relatively stressful environment with overall quite poor work life balance.
DOW,Senior Process Engineer,4,Pros:Great work life balance Exposure to global teamsCons:Not many technically challenging jobsPeople grow at same pace irrespective of performance provided you’re at least average.Less travel opportunities 
DOW,Payroll Clerk/Administrative Assistant,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Safety is first. I worked there for 10 years and although my job was turned into a contractor position, I still feel like the adminstration and Production Leaders worked very hard to keep up safe and provide quality products.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The most stressful part of my job was watching good Dow jobs for women turn into contract positions. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Safety First. Always. Workers watched out for each other and Dow was vigilent about safety."
DOW,Sr. Process Technician,3,"Change is very consistent. They promote engineers to leaders without any management experience. Some good other not ever close. Competitive wage, decent 401k, most schedules suck "
DOW,Senior R&D Technician,4,Coming from the Operations side and now working in the Research and Development department is definitely different but its a better schedule and you get to work with a lot of smart individuals.  There's also something new you get to learn each week and they want you to take your time with learning the task(s) depending how complex it is.
DOW,Lead Chemical Operator,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?It’s a job, if you suck butt your chances of promotion are increasedWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Training new employees.  The younger generation do not want to learnWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Poor communication from the managementWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy, you never know what is next"

DOW,Rouen (76),5,"8 months contract, a lot of good memories!Good management good security premises good colleagues.No restaurant.Not directly in town but very good experience"
DOW,operaio,1,What are the best aspects of your role at the company? No positive aspect private life impossible if you work in dow..conty changes shifts for lack of staff who never arrive .. low in a chemistry.stressful of the role at the company? Changes continuous shifts ..sacrifici to do at the level of timetables .. I would never refresh themselves as they are lambient and working culture at the company? stressful environment .. often dirty with their products takes place your typical oneworking day at the company? work like a mule ... with little satisfaction
DOW,Operator Technician,2,It's not a cultured atmosphere as they claim. It is definitely a smoking mirror to it. I am speaking more from a minority standpoint.   Your coworkers definitely become your second family. But the company as a whole has a ways to go. 
DOW,Research scientist,4,"Employees are very technically competent. The culture is great, inclusive and respectful. Good work life balance. Accommodations for flexible schedules."
DOW,Process Operator,4,"Smooth attitudes, fair workload, not too strenuous of a plant for the most part. DOW is big in learning DOW standards. Management is normal, good and bad apples but leadership roles shift very often. Good culture perhaps influenced by the union, no real turmoil besides horrible staffing and OT. Hardest part at this site is the OT hours and staffing inconsistency. Best part of the job is ""do your job correctly attitude"" exists, which means if you're efficient and safe, this job is easy and laid back as it should be. Big on procedures and safety, should be an operator's dream. Very low pay compared to other top companies. Lowest in the southwest when it comes to big, reputable companies."
DOW,Operator,4,Overall great experience! This job changed my life for the better. Working in CSD has been great and there’s barely any major incidents or issues. Would definitely recommend employment here 
DOW,Operator,5,"Great benefits, pay. DuPont Schedule 12 hr shift. Great co workers. Excellent work/home life balance.                                                   "
DOW,Site Logistics Technician,3,"Pay is goodSwing shift 3 on 3 offNight shift sucks but it’s better then putting up with day shift politics. A lot of meetings, leaders, engineers can be hard to do just a simple job "
DOW,Instrumentation Technician,5,"Fulfilling work, great technical challenges.  Quite a bit of bureaucracy but bearable. Safe work environment and safety systems in place to ensure worker safety."
DOW,Intern,5,I have really great colleagues and a really great team leader. They answer all my questions even when I am disturbing them while they are in a meeting. I love the international atmosphere.
DOW,Process Operator,3,Everything depends on which block you go to. So if the people like you it's great if they don't then you'll have a miserable time and not want to be there. And because of job bidding you can't leave that block. The pay is good and safety is great. But it's the luck of the draw.
DOW,Operator,5,Honest people and is a very fun place to work . I absolutely love it here but is required to move due to family moving out of state . I am going to miss being here for the most part cause it pays well and they have great job security 
DOW,Pa engineer,5,Very close knit organisation. Lots to learn and their values are very strong.They are very strong in processes of their manufacturing. Training’s are great. Team also is good if your direct reporter
DOW,Technologist,4,Good pay lots of benefits including use of corporate shuttle to Michigan when seats are available.  Opportunities to move to different dow locations as well 
DOW,Operator,1,"Laid off 10+ year employees instead of the influx of new hires. Management does not care about their employees. The only care about their ""expectations"". Well Employees have ""expectations"" of leaders as well. That little Goon from Kentucky. "
DOW,Process Technician,5,Hardest part of the job was getting along with the shifts. The job you were assigned were sometimes unclear. Management was really hands off as well. 
DOW,Lean Implementation Leader,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Work environment.  Clear objective. Excellent company to work for.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lean implementation And travelWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?collaboration and teamwork.Respect and inclusionWork-life balance, flexible work arrangementRecognition and awardsEthical and responsible practiceWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Work with the manager for lean implementation,5S, VSM"
DOW,Quality Leader,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Comptetitve pay and flexible hours.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Unless you are a chemical engineer, you will have no career path here.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Non-existent - the entire company is remote most of the time which stifles creativity, collaboration & impairs overall results.What is a typical day like for you at the company?12 hour days overloaded with meetings."
DOW,Cyber Security Analyst,4,"Dow has come a long way in the last 10 years. There’s a strong culture of diversity and inclusion, they empower staff at all levels to make decisions, and the work-life balance cannot get any better. Design your day is emphasized where you work with your leader to find the best schedule that fits your life. Great benefits and great people."
DOW,Board Operator,3,a lot of money to be made. no home life. work a lot of hours with people who like to start drama and does not know how to do their job properly. it is like high school but you get paid for it. 
DOW,Automation engineer,4,Very good culture. Management very supportive and open. Great work life balance. Dow is very procedural which can be both good and bad at times. Overall great place to work. 
DOW,Logistics Technician,3,"I had high expectations going into Dow and a positive mindset. The combination of poor management communication, lack of pay for the dangers, swing shift, lack of movement, and drama create a recipe to ruin mental and physical health. Not all buildings at DOW are equal. No matter how good of a worker you are, if someone else is in a higher hazard building with less experience than you they will get picked first, making you feel stuck and forced to make a lateral move into another building instead of a vertical move which prolongs career growth even further."
DOW,Reliability Engineer,4,"Plant engineers get meaningful projects to work on.  Personally appreciated the culture of standardized best practices.  Great site networks at Freeport, local plant politics can be challenging.  Desire to live near an urban center\ Houston versus short commute\ LJ can be a challenge depending on preferences"
DOW,Unknown,1,"You are nothing but a number to them and are dispensable.  Work demands are outrageous and you are underpaid.  When a worker is injured on duty, the company will blame the employee and make the case not work related. "
Spectrum,Recruiter,5,"I've been employed with Spectrum for 3.5 years. It's a company I plan to retire from. I've been nothing but impressed with the level of service, professionalism and overall vision of the company.  I've been fortunate to witness."
Spectrum,Billing Specialist,5,I worked at Spectrum for 2 1/2 years. Awesome place to work. Supervisors were amazing as well. Great benefits. I wish I never had to quit this job. Definitely miss it
Spectrum,CSR - Customer Service Representative,4,It’s ok. They will work with you to give you what you need but it’s a hard job with people yelling at you so Day and barely any time between calls. Have a thick skin
Spectrum,Rep 1,5,At spectrum the pay begins at $20/hr and within six months of being in production you have the chance to level up to rep 2 and etc until you reach rep 3 each level earning more money 
Spectrum,Telemarketer,1,Your first three weeks of training you don’t learn too much of anything. They throw you to the wolves on the phone  The feeling of trying to convince someone to buy something they don’t want is very overwhelming  The people literally have a superior complex  
Spectrum,Sales Associate,2,"The job itself is not too bad. Goals are hard to hit because of the call center. Moving up is hard. Rehire, no. Had PPD they won’t hire me back. I have met several members of management that had to ask associates questions because they didn’t know the answer. Those people were hired over people with 7 plus years experience. Said associates are underpaid considering they’re having to do managements duties. I really enjoyed working there despite all the negative. "
Spectrum,Representative,3,"Interpersonal Skills Development: Regular interaction with clients helps improve communication, problem-solving, and conflict resolution skills, which are valuable in any career. Flexibility: Many representative roles, especially in customer service, offer flexible hours or the opportunity to work remotely, which can support a healthy work-life balance."
Spectrum,Direct Sales Representative,5,"Good place to work staff and pay very well, and you will go places . Thank spectrum for the services you provide in a timely fashion. Do all you can and success will be obtained via this great company. The pay is great perks are excellent."
Spectrum,Customer Service Representative,5,"Great place to work, amazing benefits, and the leadership does alot to listen to you and your feedback. The job can be very stressful but also rewarding helping customers"
Spectrum,Construction Coordinator II,4,There is plenty of opportunities if you are good at what you do. In the recent years the turn over has been extremely high in the lower level jobs. So the ones that are at least half way decent are able to move up in the company extremely fast. The con to that is mediocre employees get into positions that they should never be in. It's a good place to start your career no doubt. 
Spectrum,Analyst,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Good benefits, treated fairly (for the most part). Like most companies, it depends on who you are working with and for.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Knowing that staff reductions were not going to stop.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Business casual dress. Spectrum was put together from a lot of smaller companies, so I think to a large extent the culture was local as opposed to national.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Get to work on time, do my job.  Treated very good if I needed to leave early or take care of something at home."
Spectrum,Outside Sales Representative,5,"moneys okay, easy job if you can sell. Only bad thing is silly quotas as soon as you start selling as an entry level salesperson, kinda makes things unrealistic"
Spectrum,Sales Associate,3,Work environment is very chill for the most part & they are not strict at all. This is a sales job however so if you think that it will be a cake walk it’s definitely not. But if u can sale or have sales experience you’ll be okay
Spectrum,Store Associate,5,Great atmosphere. Amazing people to work with. Clean environment. Happy to have been an employee. 10/10 definitely would recommend w i t h o u t a d o u b t. 
Spectrum,Customer Service Representative,2,"I am not saying this job wouldn't be for anyone. Some people have been there a long time and have advanced decently, but it is on par with the normal call center environment where you have to deal with a lot of misery to get there, and if you have convictions or don't believe your company is always right and you don't care most about serving them at your expense, you're more likely to be miserable than feel content.There were several things during training alone that put me off, and it continued to get worse. We were told COVID was not a valid reason for calling in, then come June, everyone had COVID and they were still at work. This led to me getting COVID and I did not handle it well. It made my neuro issues worse and I am miserable at the moment and had to go back into PT. I had seen people getting sick on site and supervisors coaching them to return to work because they were in training and couldn't miss any time. People there act like this is just normal or part of the job. There's no reason it should be when you work for a multi-million dollar company.The reason I gave 2 stars is because the benefits are good and affordable, but it is a small price to give up for happiness."
Spectrum,Appointment Setter,1,"They suck and blow at the same time.Oh yeah they lie alot too. Every time you think that you're succeeding , they bring something up to make it sound like you failed. Whenever you think you're doing good , they will make you feel like you less then. They think they're cute with. Their non-answer answers when they're just basically a bunch of babies. They should scuttle the whole program and start all over again. With mature adults."
Spectrum,Customer Service Representative,2,"A typical day at work is sitting and answering phone calls, all day, and they only give you a 5 minute break to go to the bathroom which you have to clock out for. I learned how to deal with customer complaints and resolve all inquiries. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. After training, they place you with a supervisor. Mine threw me under the bus to the manager instead of pulling me aside and training me on what I needed improvement on. He had scheduled a meeting with the manager and myself and when I confronted him on what the meeting was about, he acted like he didn’t know. I don’t know if it’s discrimination or not but I left after 6 months. Other than that, the benefits are worth it if you’re willing to sacrifice your mental health. "
Spectrum,Human Resources Generalist,4,"Productive workplace, always learned something new. Partners across the organization that were willing to collaborate. Unique atmosphere and work culture. "
Spectrum,Field Operations ,3,You are held to a near impossible to meet standard in an area where the people are very difficult.   They will find a reason to fire you if your metrics are not good enough.  
Spectrum,Strategic Account Specialist,1,"-Expected to come in 5 days, little flexibility.-Micromanaging everywhere-Infighting with boundary partners-Low morale in office-High turn overOnly work here if you are a 100%  self starter and sales is your life, avoid if you have a family."
Spectrum,Cable Technician,1,It pays well but you would like to leave field Operations as soon as possible. Lots of metrics and quotas to meet constant harassment by supervisors would not advise if you don’t have thick skin and patient 
Spectrum,Recruiter,5,"I've been employed with Spectrum for 3.5 years. It's a company I plan to retire from. I've been nothing but impressed with the level of service, professionalism and overall vision of the company.  I've been fortunate to witness."
Spectrum,Store Sales Associate,3,"Overall, decent retail sales job. Pay is better than most retail jobs but schedule brutal. Very good benefits, particularly 401k match. Lots of employee turnover."
Spectrum,Network Engineer,5,"I had an overall positive experience working at Spectrum. I learned a lot and the experience with such a large network helped me get a high paying job. Spectrum would keep a lot more talent if it paid competitively. I liked the benefits I had: free cable and internet, discounted Spectrum Mobile and $10K a year in education. I would have stayed if they matched the offer"
Spectrum,Residential Retention Specialist,3,"Good company to work for. Pay could be raised for what you deal with, as in convincing customers on top of only receiving commission 3months after “making it” and it being taxed 35%. "
Spectrum,Call Center Representative,5,"Great place to work, management is great and I enjoyed all of my co workers I would recommend working here the environment can be very fast paced but rewarding "
Spectrum,Analyst,4,Supportive leadership. Biggest downside is have mostly in office hours.  Internal promotion paths are abundant. Education opportunities. Great benefits. Lots of opportunity for career development. 
Spectrum,Mobile Customer Service Representative,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Free internet and cable.They worked with if needed for Dr. Appointment What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with customers calling in and super angry about their bills or missed  deliveries What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Diversity,  clean, big kitchen to cook your lunch"
Spectrum,Electronics Technician,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Learning new things and experienceWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Sending orders on time too much pressureWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?We have lots of departments but few peopleWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Friday  because we go home early
Spectrum,Rete,4,it was ok decent pay good trainers overall a good company I LOVED IT call centers aren’t for everyone but this company was an amazing opportunity go for it some days are bad but its good if you have a hustler mentality 
Spectrum,Senior Software Engineer,3,"Good work and life balance, management is poor with technology handling.They are more focused on providing more value to shareholder than the customer."
Spectrum,Resedential Retention Supervisor,1,"Longevity, loyalty, teamwork, exceeding performance/productivity goals, and work life balance are not recognized or appreciated. No matter how hard you work, how many hours you are putting in daily (even from home on off days), or how well your teams perform, it is never enough nor good enough for the upper management of this company. "
Spectrum,Supervisor,5,"It’s a great place to work at for those who want to advance in their career. Multiple opportunities for advancement and broad possibilities. You must be self sufficient, open to feedback, a go getter, good attendance, behaviors, and performance. They offer great benefits, pay, life work balance, and retirement benefits. It can be stressful, like any other job, yet rewarding. "
Spectrum,Retention Specialist,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Free cable they are two faced they will tell you one thing and do something else. They just lie and don’t care about the person. And if they fire you they will fight to not pay unemployment.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?They add more and responsibility with no pay raiseWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?It sucks they stab you in the back What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work and work some more and no pay raises
Spectrum,Accountant,4,Great place to work but longer hours during closing months. Some mangers were good and sheild you from the executive at the top. Overall great place to work.
Spectrum,Field Technician,3,"As a Field Technician, the job was rarely boring and often challenging. Benefits were fantastic, and both classroom and field training was provided. However, the micromanaging and lack of trust in employees became very wearing."
Spectrum,Billing Representative,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Spectrum maintains a professional atmosphere. Their focus on giving the customer the best quality of service is priority. The training was intensive prior to working with customers and extended while on the phone with customers. Voluntary overtime is available. I loved the atmosphere as there's no tolerance for anything but a professional demeanor yet management is always finding ways to support a relaxed, friendly comradery amongst employees. I appreciated the catered lunches and random  gifts to boost morale. There's many chances for advancement, as well. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The most stressful part was in the beginning, first interacting with the customers and remembering the billing codes but after I left a new system was implemented to make the process easier plus you always have assistance by simply reaching out to a lead or supervisor. You hear a lot of customer's complaints but that's what the job is about - addressing the issue and most customers are very grateful once their issue is resolved. I wasn't bothered by complaints because I was trained well, had easy access to assistance and understood that's why were there - to satisfy the customer. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Relaxed and professional with opportunities for advancement What is a typical day like for you at the company?Hearing complaints, transferring to correct department. I worked in billing and addressed only those issues. Sales, tech support or mobile phone service was transferred. - more..."
Spectrum,Sales Representative,1,"I met some wonderful people, but working here is awful.""CALL FLOW"" is ridiculous. Sell ​​when customers are upset etc. etc. stay on the phone make up stories to keep people on the phone for a specific amount of time, trying to sell them things they don't ask for. The management is a disaster, some people have strayed into those positions, besides, there are not enough of them, so it is very disorganized. Not all mentors and managers are unprofessional and mean. Zero business ethics. Recommendation: do not apply!"
Spectrum,Outside Sales Representative,4,"Outside sales position is 6 hours deployed Monday-Friday usually between 12-6/7. You're doing D2Dsales so you're knocking doors all day trying to get people to switch to Spectrum. The initial computer training is very corporate and separated from the actual experience. You learn the actual job in the field doing the job and talking with/shadowing other reps. Culture is what your direct leadership makes it. Recently in the Great Lakes Region, they cleared out a lot of managers, supervisors and whole sales teams. This destroyed the culture and it turned a great place to work with great management to a corporate 9-5 sales job.  However,  the pay is pretty good for experienced and first year sales reps. Experienced or newer and eager sales reps bring in 75-100k a year, top performers in the company make anywhere from 150-300k. 40K base + unlimited commission + free Spectrum Services and really  good benefits...not for the weak."
Spectrum,Lead Traffic Specialist ,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Good benefits and opportunities for job advancement What is the most stressful part about working at the company?I don't know, I can't speak on what's stressful."
Spectrum,Unappreciated,1,Culture is dead and the upper management is so far disconnected from the staff. Commission is horrible even with more experience than store combined in total. I HAVE A SKILL SET THATS NOT UTILIZED.  I HAVE NO FUTURE AT COMPANY. We spend more time in therapy than we do at work due to mental abuse.
Spectrum,Billing Customer Service Representative,5,"Great benefits; shift bids so schedules available to fit everyone. Good starting pay & room for career advancement! Metrics driven, possibility of commission & good starting pay can be a career if you allow it. "
Spectrum,Recruiter,5,"I've been employed with Spectrum for 3.5 years. It's a company I plan to retire from. I've been nothing but impressed with the level of service, professionalism and overall vision of the company.  I've been fortunate to witness."
Spectrum,Telesales Representative,5,The training at Spectrum truly set me up for success. It was a right place wrong time sort of situation with this job. I wish they still had this position so I could come back! 
Spectrum,Field Technician,2,"The benefits are great and the pay isn't bad for entry level ($22 an hour). You're guaranteed your 40 hours also which is nice. However, the upper management couldn't care less about you. They help sometimes but most of the time they do not. They'll employ mandatory OT when it's not necessary and then overload you on work for the day instead of it being spread out over the course of the week. This is due to customer care not doing their job or caring. They only care about numbers and the company is failing but trying hard to keep customers at a field techs expense. You'll also run into customers that are angry at you for their stuff not working regardless of who's fault it is. Met some great coworkers though. They also say you can self-promote by doing training but that's only for the first couple promotions, past that, you'll have to move for other promotions and it's usually not close by."
Spectrum,Billing Specialist,3,"The pay is good, although people don’t come in calling to thank you for the bill. Just try not to take it too personal with how some customers talk to you over the phone, and this is a great job for you "
Spectrum,Customer Service Representative,3,Lots of calls very little feedback taken from the agents by management. Customers internet services very inconsistent as well as bad communication between sales and clients
Spectrum,Outside Sales Representative,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Customer satisfaction ,dedication,product quality What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Zero :great progress /product What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great /happy area/great customer What is a typical day like for you at the company?Coffee with sugar and share the goal to employees that I coached to met achievesble goals."
Spectrum,Field Technician,4,"Outside and active. The job was always changing. Downsides were working in the rain or snow, or sometimes filthy homes. Other than that I enjoyed the work."
Spectrum,Technical Support Representative,3,"A typical call center with 6 week training, paid training, and good benefits. A typical day consist of a meeting, 60-80 calls, a weekly coaching with your supervisor, two breaks and an hour lunch, LMS, troubleshooting, billing questions."
Spectrum,Retail Sales Specialist,5,If you get in stay in! Very fun easy job You get to meet a lot of different people Amazing co workers that work as a team mines help me get sales till I got it!
Spectrum,Internet Repair,5,"Love the company, but  some of the managers and a Supervisors have Power strike egos. They get away with being trouble makers. You can work remote after you meet certain metrics. A fun work environment. "
Spectrum,Account Executive,2,Extremely micromanaged company. Management cares more about checking boxes than driving results. They do not allow account executives to manage their territories in a way that makes sense. They are more worried about looking good on paper and busy work than producing sales. 
Spectrum,Inbound Sales Representative,3,"This is a call center. You are on the phone 24/7 with 2 15 minute breaks and an hour lunchbreak. Your job involves answering calls that could be regarding anything, and selling them on Spectrum's services. Sometimes you have great days and sometimes your days are terrible. Luck plays a 50/50 part in this role. As long as you can sit back and take calls without being stressed, and enjoy speaking with people. This job is fine. Be prepared to feel drained at the end of the day. The classroom is mainly to learn about the products Spectrum offers. The actual skill of selling was not touched on too much with my group. Be prepared to teach yourself that part. Overall, if you have experience in a REAL sales position, you could enjoy your time here. Turn over rate is relatively high, and I understand why. Just be sure you know what you're getting into. Good benefits, and potential to make a good 60-70k/year if you're dedicated and consistent."
Spectrum,Video Repair Representative,1,Very unprofessional work environment. Be aware that they have closed several call centers (including the location I was employed at) in the past couple of years and they only gave a two month notice.
Spectrum,Field Technician,1,They will threaten you. They send you out on jobs when you aren’t even remotely ready which in turn will end up making you look bad. HR did not stick up for me in the least. The training center have some extremely unprofessional teachers that have a macho attitude. 
Spectrum,Retention Specialist,2,They require you to meet certain quotas for sales which is reasonable but it’s the way they have you get the sale is very questionable. They are not completely honest with consumers beware 
Spectrum,Video/Internet Repair Agent,1,"Typical work day is back to back p0’d off callers, who don’t listen or care how they speak to the “agents”. During “weekly coaches” “leadership” hears how p0’d the people call in, how ignorant and arrogant and yet it’s all blame of “the agent”. They let go of knowledgeable people cause they try their best to help, but hire new airheaded numbers to meet their quota "
Spectrum,Customer Service Representative,1,Wht makes this job hard is they want you to bundle cable services with internet and home phone packages. People don't really use Cable or Home Phones but they want you to sell it to everybody. It leads to a lot of akward conversations as people only want Internet and not home phone or cable. 
Spectrum,Internet voice repair ,1,"Customers are rude, yearly raises are little to no money even if you get a 5/5, the supervisors are all big headed and make you hate your job. Too many changes "
Spectrum,Customer Care Representative,3,"Unfair expectations for things out of your control but pay and benefits are good. Upper management does not care about you, but I find that true at any large company."
Spectrum,Sales Specialist,2,"Territory managers and above are horrible and don't care about you. I only recommend this job as last resort or if you have friends that work there. 30 minute lunch is also not reasonable with the stuff we put up with & commission structure changes every 5 months for the worse, just making it harder and less simple to do things. Also the hours make it hard to do anything as you will probably close every day as co workers tend to leave every other month."
Spectrum,Retention Specialist,2,So my biggest problem with this job was that me and several others felt like we didn't have the proper tools to help customers and that alot of the time we felt like we just had to tell customers sorry nothing we can do to help to keep you
Spectrum,Recruiter,5,"I've been employed with Spectrum for 3.5 years. It's a company I plan to retire from. I've been nothing but impressed with the level of service, professionalism and overall vision of the company.  I've been fortunate to witness."
Spectrum,Maintenance Technician,3,Pay is good but the direction management is going is slowly killing the joy of work  overall work experience average . Wouldn’t be surprised if they will soon or already have added cameras inside our trucks / vans 
Spectrum,Repair Technician,3,It's an alright place to work if you can deal with technologically challenged and stressed out customers. Lots of metrics to meet and bi weekly one on ones to review your performance where you have to watch recordings of yourself while your supervisor critiques. 
Spectrum,Scheduling Coordinator,5,"Beautiful work environment Typical day is fast paced and action packed. Every day was a little different,  so never boring! I learned many technological skills."
Spectrum,Retention Specialist,3,"Lots of micromanagement, however benefits are amazing . Coworkers are great . Have to work holidays . Overall would be better if there was consistency . "
Spectrum,Retention Specialist,5,Would consider going back if work from home. You make new friends and learn new things still keep in contact with old friends. Pretty good pay! Stressful but not to bad…
Spectrum,Retention Specialist,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great friendly team of management.  They made everyone feel welcome. Assisted always with every question.  They made everyone feel encouraged and helped with all training and on the job reviews were supportive.  Terrific benefits.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Nothing really stressful due to the supportive management.  Sometimes unable to immediately answer a question, however always received immediate help.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Terrific and supportive.  Parties, happy music every AM.  Everyone felt TEAM and happy.  I felt valued.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Come in, join the team for good morning welcome.  Quick group meeting advised of any changes or updates we needed to know.   Day went by quickly. Great pay and benefits."
Spectrum,"Senior Director, Product Management",4,"Spectrum has a traditional culture relative to things like dress code and being required to work in office (little flexibility with remote work). Employee well being isn't a priority. However, total compensation is above industry standards for similar roles.  "
Spectrum,Sales Specialist,4,Really good job really good money but honestly be prepared to be consistently pushed. You will work with lazy people just focus on your money. Always room for growth
Spectrum,Technician,1,"no longer working for the company, apparently you only have a certain(unspecified) amount of time to heal after being struck by an automobile on the job."
Spectrum,Retention Specialist,5,Great pay and very easy job if you follow directions. Commission is huge and your able to work from home if stats are good. Easy and laid back support group
Spectrum,Retention Specialist,3,So basically you’re going to be stopping customers from canceling there services and try to sell them cell phone service at the same time but the stats are so unrealistic you have to do shady business. 
Spectrum,Residential Connectivity Specialist,5,"Good company great sales experience, love the culture you can experience a lot of no from customers but that’s part of any sales job just keep swimming all you can make a ton of money here "
Spectrum,Retention Agent,2,Job was very stressful but I had one of the best supervisors very supportive and made work less stressful. Unfortunately my location closed down with a 60 day notice
Spectrum,Specialist ,5,"It's a good place to make extra money besides hourly pay. Overtime available, only negative side is there is not alot of room to move up in the company."
Spectrum,Customer Service Retention Agent,3,You can make a lot of money here it's just very stressful at times you constantly have to meet your numbers and once you master one thing they change it and want you to sell something else. Turnover rate is very high but many opportunities to grow 
Spectrum,Business Sales Representative,5,Amazing benefits. Laid back job. You have to be very focused to get sales or else base pay is all you will see. They promote from within and give a ton of incentives. 
Spectrum,Customer Service Representative,2,"productive and fun workplace, lots of growth potential, work from home opportunities available, good middle management, promotions to team leads available"
Spectrum,Sales Representative,4,"Sold door to door. Learn a ton, grew professionally then moved on. Positive Experience! Work less part time but considered full time. Learned much. Supportive management. Culture sell sell sell. Hard knocking doors. Enjoyed knocking doors meeting new people."
Spectrum,"Director, Talent Acquisition",5,What is the best part of working at the company?The people I got to work with were amazingWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?No work from home policy or flex timeWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Depends on the department and organization I happened to have the most amazing boss
Spectrum,Customer Service Billing Agent/Training Assistant,4,"The only major issue I had was taking time off. There is a list. If you don't get your time in, you don't get time off. Even if it's put in MONTHS in advance."
Spectrum,Recruiter,5,"I've been employed with Spectrum for 3.5 years. It's a company I plan to retire from. I've been nothing but impressed with the level of service, professionalism and overall vision of the company.  I've been fortunate to witness."
Spectrum,Retention Specialist,2,"I worked as a retention agent for 2 years, what really caused me to leave was the unrealistic metrics they expect. Customers are calling to cancel and it is hard enough to keep the customer, but they force you to sell mobiles on every call. If you don’t management is breathing down your neck. It’s a retention job not sales but you have to make sells (mobiles) to keep your job. They care more about sales than actually helping the customers."
Spectrum,Retention Agent,2,"Your typical day working for Spectrum is stress!! Customer calling to cancel services and you have to pitch in every call a way to increase customer bill even if they calling to cancelYou have to literally beg  the customer not to cancel service .. hardest part was hearing the customer yell and tell you just cancel the service quit trying to sell me stuff, I changed providers  and it’s none of your business how much I’m going to pay with them.. Selling a  cellphone in a call is a must even if they are angry/ or canceling  you have to pitch it!! Everytime I  would sell a cellphone I would feel bad for the customer because the mobile service is not the best you will loose connection constantly. Management only cares about your stats, they don’t care about your health your just a number for this company. The hardest part about working here is hearing customer yell at you, if you think your doing your job good think again they find any way what’s so ever to nitpick about everything. Your job is not secure! On your days off you spend it thinking about work!! Dreading the day where you have to go back to work.  They make it seem like it’s a good pay but their commission has changed so much. "
Spectrum,RSC Dispatcher,3,"If you work at the service center, expect to  be inundated with calls from technicians...all day....every day...and watch your life go by. Having free cable was nice. You were just too burnt out to enjoy it."
Spectrum,Senior Technical Project Manager,4,Work life balance work environment. Effective Team communication. Great Management  to work with as contractor. Opportunity to learn and grow. Great Team work. Flexibility to work from home as per convenience. 
Spectrum,Offline Customer Support II,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits program and matching 401K.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management is haphazard, very disorganized.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Its a melange of ineptitude and dysfunction at so many levels. Culture? CYA.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Arrive, Clock in, see what they have planned for the day then grin and bear it."
Spectrum,Sales Specialist,2,"Spectrum is a toxic and regressive workplace. Their systems and procedures are as outdated as the cable they’re selling. Want to pay a bill? Gotta show ID. Want to return a box? Gotta show ID. Doesn’t matter if you’re buying anything or not. Want to make a payment at the store? First you will be forced to listen to a long winded sales pitch on a home phone, mobile line, or tv package. They may even tell you to add the phone to get a discount on your internet and then cancel the phone after 30 days. Spectrum is cooking the numbers by doing this, as it makes it seem like customers are actually signing up for services. I brought these concerns to management, and generally clashed over inefficient policies. My performance was among the top, however. But they fired me anyway, under the guise of a violation of company policy. Overall, Spectrum is ok, but you have to be ok working in a chaotic environment, where nothing you do will ever be good enough, and the company not only doesn’t back you up, they cause the issues by not reigning in bad managers and raising prices on customers every other day, which causes them to be angry. It was a good run, I make about $33k net in 197 days, but that was working open to close, 6-7 days a week, and burning myself out doing 60,70,80+ mobile lines. If you have any semblance of independence or demonstrate above average competency at your job, that’s not always a good thing, as it can expose insecurities within your current manager. Kind of long winded, but it’s basically a Boys and Girls club and the ones that are in the club will be promoted - more..."
Spectrum,Customer Service Representative,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?you get free cable and internet  services.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?talking to the mean and rude customersWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?You take calls, calls, calls, calls all day long."
Spectrum,Sales Representative,3,"Good pay sometimes but kind of a shady job, there is always goals that are not realistic, however you will still be reviewed over them, may need to get along with supervisors and mangers if you want to still be hired  "
Spectrum,Field Technician,4,Good pay and just about all the overtime you could want but it turns into long days and burnout. Expect to go into some of the nastiest houses that should be on an episode of hoarders. 
Spectrum,Residential Connectivity Specialist,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?This is a great team environment, support, training and awesome benefits!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not really stressful, they have a great open door policy in my department! Just come train and get your work done.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very light and super supportive!What is a typical day like for you at the company?Plan my route in my assigned turf, report to my supervisor my start time and get out and knock on doors!"
Spectrum,Outbound Business Sales Representative,1,Terrible Company to work for they have a numbers goal that is unattainable. It has the biggest turnover of employees I’ve ever seen. Would highly recommend you look for another employer over 95 percent of the people that start here last about 3 months. 
Spectrum,Supervisor,1,Very toxic work environment upper management only knows how to lead by fear. Every aspect of your job duties are micro managed. You are told to break company policy by upper management yet they will fire you in a heart beat if they don’t like you and use that as the reason.if you work there CYA.
Spectrum,Business Sales Representative,1,"Very tough place to have a life outside of work. VP puts unnecessary stress and pressure on managers who passes negativity to supervisors, who passes it down to sales agents. Most calls are from existing customers with issues. Leadership is outside a lot on smoke breaks while reps are mentally getting destroyed by calls. Not much growth opportunities at all. Lose the VP and get a better support system and people will love to be there."
Spectrum,Sales Representative,2,"• Lots of driving, often with little to no results• Learned how to speak with prospective clients with more confidence• Poor management; rarely cared about employee wellbeing, and lied often• Typical sales culture; not great• Being forced to sell an objectively inferior product to the competitor (using ""hybrid copper"" lines instead of fiber)• Met some great coworkers with wonderful personalities."

Clear direction and overall management were great!What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work environment was great.  Management was clear about goals and providing  encouragement,  clear direction, opportunities. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Morning staff meetings, discussing assignments, collaboration,  and completing / meeting deadlines."
Spectrum,Sales Agent Representative,2,"I met some wonderful people, but working here is awful. ""CALL FLOW"" absolutely ridiculous.  Sell when customers are upset etc. etc. stay on the phone makeup stories to keep people on the phone for a specific amount of time. When in training you have nice desk with room with co-workers - when out of  training for back to back calls of upset customers you are sent to a area i wouldnt call a desk - its the size of a  shelf with a computer the size of BOX---there are co-workers who are big who could hardly fit in it..AND THE AIR CONDITIONER IS SET IN THE SIXTIES - YOU ARE SITTING TALKING AND FREEZING- By the way - stay away."
Spectrum,Field Technician,3,Good money if you don’t have a family to attend to and if your military you can use your gi bill to help you out with money. Take home van is also a plus
Spectrum,Customer Service Representative,4,Great job. Leadership addresses concerns in a timely manner. Calls can become overwhelming at times but the pay and satisfying the customers makes it worth the while

Spectrum,Sales Representative,4,I enjoyed my time there before the store was closed down in my area. Had the best manager and coworkers and always looked forward to going to work. Great benefits too!
Energy Transfer,Crude Oil Hauler,3,"Pay sucks. They always blame the drivers for everything. Their equipment is always broken, and the upper management blames the broken equipment on someone else instead of fixing it "
Energy Transfer,Account Payable Specialist,2,"Too much inconsistency in the accounts. You work to please your supervisor instead of doing your actual job. It does not matter how much you work, If your supervisor does not like you, they find a way to get you fired. Too many great employees were let go because of flimsy and unreasonable excuses. Lots of overtime as well, sometimes you are mandated to work on Saturdays. The pay is not fantastic."
Energy Transfer,Truck Driver,5,"Good place to work, friendly environment, if you needed more loads dispatch or management was always on it no matter what time day or night, overall good experience. "
Energy Transfer,Pipeline Technician,5,Working at energy transfer is very productive and you will gain a huge amount of skills.It is a fast paced work day and the time flys by.

Energy Transfer,"Real Estate and Surveying Right of Way Analyst, II",5,I’m not able to pass on a lot of information because it was a buyout from a company called NuStar Energy.  I worked for NuStar for 10 years.  It was a A+ company that gave so much to their employees and in return we gave back.  We were a family that was truly sad to see the company to come to an end.  I have never worked for such a dedicated and loyal company to their employees.  They would say to us the best is yet to come.

Energy Transfer,Pipeline controller,4,ET control room is a great stepping stone or even long term destination to learn necessary skills as a controller. The control room has plenty of good employees who are more than willing to help you develop professionally.
Energy Transfer,Operator,5,The place was good to work at. The culture was good and the pay was right on par. Management did a good job overall and never had issues with them. As long as you do your job you’ll be fine.
Energy Transfer,Operator,2,No work/life balance with the current schedule. Very high turnover rate because of the schedule. Everyone wants the 8/6 schedule back. All other departments have 8/6 schedule but not operators. Evey operator working here is seeking other jobs because they want a better work/life balance. The current schedule might work if you lived in a big city but not a small town. No time to leave town and do anything fun. It's like you're trapped in Watford City.Everything else is ok but the schedule is a deal breaker. Don't work here unless you like having no life.

You are working with many cross functioning teams such as field operations, customers, controllers, maintenance, commercial, contracts and accounting. This gives you a broad understanding of the overall business objectives and goals within the company. The workplace culture is great, most everyone works together in synergy. The hardest part of the job is responding to operational issues that arise on a daily basis, but the challenge keeps you on your toes and helps you learn further in detail of how everything works. The position functions similar to that of a project manager when planning out day to day activities. "

However once you get onboard and everything goes well. The job is physically demanding but it’s not complicated. It’s one of those jobs that it’s only harder if you make it harder. The pay is good as long as you got a good area and route. Sometimes there are days where it’s not really good based on route and what happens to your environment.

From early to mid career the growth is good, there are tons of ways to add value and optimize a company that grew this size in such a short time.

Energy Transfer,Field Technician,1,"below average pay, incompetent management, financially punished employees who didnt get the vax, can use the compressor stations yards for target practice with bows, crossbows and small arms if you have a particular area manager with you. more turnovers than tim hortons. good bonuses if your buddies with your manager and a bigger bonus if you take him hunting on your property and tie a deer to a tree for him to shoot "

Energy Transfer,Pipeline Technician,2,Complete Mickey Mouse operation…area management are either incompetent or just have clue how a pipeline works…management pits employees against each other.

Energy Transfer,Crude Oil Hauler,3,"Pay sucks. They always blame the drivers for everything. Their equipment is always broken, and the upper management blames the broken equipment on someone else instead of fixing it "
Energy Transfer,Plant Operator,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great employees, was similar to having another family. Always changing.

No one person has anything really more expected of them than the next.What is a typical day like for you at the company?At a plant your daily is often relatively the same each day, but it's a plant, anything can change at any given moment. You prioritize your daily requirements due to the current situation."
Energy Transfer,Driver,5,Home every day. Advancement opportunities. Good pay and benefits. Decent equipment. Most stressful part is waiting to offload at lacts. Best trucking job I've had. 
Energy Transfer,Crude Oil Tank Driver,5,"There are two twelve  hour shifts in which to finish your loads. Management does not pressure you to rush your routes. Drivers help each other with route information, which is especially helpful at night. The hardest part of the job is finding some of the rural locations. Testing the Crude Oil tanks can be challenging, if you are not use to being 15-20 feet off the ground. Most enjoyable part of the work driving through the beautiful side (during the day of course) and seeing the trees and animals. "

Energy Transfer,Engineer,3,"Energy Transfer runs a tight ship and typically pays less than its competitors. They hang on to people with good bonuses but even that was taken away when COVID happened. To boot, they handled the COVID situation very poorly and will likely lose many employees who feel they have been financially punished as executives take home some of the largest bonuses they have ever seen. 3 Stars because the work is rewarding and you get a ton of experience/opportunities by working here. One could say they are a stepping stone to better opportunities!"
Energy Transfer,Truck Driver,1,"Management could be better, If you have a Question or need something forget about it, the only way they communicate is by Text.Start you out on Nights which is alright but the Differential is only $15.00 not enough  to miss out on the Family, Made better money at other Trucking Co.  But as long as you are in the Click you will be Alright."
Energy Transfer,Operator,2,Get ready to work if you are in operations at the Houston Terminal. Management at the terminal doesn’t care about anything unless it affects them. Been short people for a long time and it’s only getting worse. Operations guys are doing upwards to 900 hours of OT a year. When concerns are brought up to management they’re laughed off or completely ignored. Even stop work authority is overridden without proper accountability. I’m sure Energy Transfer is a great company as a whole but this terminal is a joke. Terminal Manager has no clue what’s happening on the front lines because the Operations Managers withhold information. They all preach safety but then Operations Managers turn a blind eye to policy to get the job done. Terminal has a ton of potential but will never go anywhere with the 2 Operations Managers that are in charge now. People are leaving in droves so good luck if you get in. 
Energy Transfer,Measurement Specialist,5,What is the best part of working at the company?So much room to grow an excel. Strong management qualitiesWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Being away from family for me.

Quality execution.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Learn something new everyday with ETC. Chance to work with graet team.
Energy Transfer,Terminal operator ,3,Dirty job that doesn’t stop pays alright and a decent place to start. You can learn a lot or just sit around and watch others work. Do your time and leave.
Energy Transfer,Environmental Specialist,4,Good work life balance with the ability to move into new roles. Great management that understands their employees. Pay is okay for the work load and industry standards. 
Energy Transfer,Pipeline Controller,5,A place to make a career. Professional people and an incredibly organized system of processes and software to help you succeed. Training for controllers is supplied and compensation is very competitive. 
Energy Transfer,Safety rep,5,Awesome place to work. Tasks can get repetitive at times but overall would recommend this company. There is a lot of management and politics but that’s expected for this size organization. 
Energy Transfer,Supervisor,4,ETC is a great place to work overall. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better company within the energy realm. I've been here for a little over 10 years now and wouldn't change a thing.
Energy Transfer,Crude Oil Driver,3,Was an okay place to work. Management really made the job miserable to go to. Non stop getting onto people about little things. Wouldn't just let you do your work and go home.  
Energy Transfer,Area Supervisor,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Not a good place to work anymore.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management is horrible and unprofessional and treat drivers terrible.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Not good environment and is very stressful.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Everything is always the driver's fault and that is how upper management trains it lower management people.
Energy Transfer,Class A Operator,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The coworker's where very nice and helpful.  Management was focus and very helpful as well.

Energy Transfer,Controls Specialist,5,Management expects that everyone uses their time and abilities to solve problems and safely get the job done. People who educate themselves and keep up with new technologies and processes have opportunities for advancement. 
Energy Transfer,Plant Operator,5,I wish i never left them they were awesome company to work for payed very well and let me have all the overtime i wanted they also were always easy to work with
Energy Transfer,Plant Operator B,4,"It's a good overall company it's one of the very few companies out in West Texas that you don't have to shave they do pay very well really good insurance good 401k and I've been told that you could transfer to other locations, it was a dumb mistake for me to leave the company I have regretted and I have been trying to go back even though I left on good terms it's been really hard I've had one interview since then for a different type of a job but I did not get the job if I could do it all over again I would not leave."
Energy Transfer,Crude Oil Transport Driver,3,We are under payed for what's done here. The money is decent but it should be more. The guys here are awesome we have a text group where if you run into a bind all you have to do is put it in the text and someone will reach out to help. Now the equipment is horrible always breaking down because they are been ran 24 hours. Day shift guy get out then the night shift guy jumps in. What's good is we have 24 hours access to get the truck fixed when needed but breaking down take away from your money. I'm not going to beat the company down because it's a okay company to work for but they need to get more trucks which they say are on the way. I don't regret working here. Here no one is riding you over your shoulder. 
Energy Transfer,Applications Support Specialist,4,"ProsGreat compensation and  benefits, pay for parking & bus commuteConsHouston location is downtown which can be stressful. They are anti-WFH. Has a GOP political aura to it. During inclement there is that feeling they still want employees to come in regardless. "
Energy Transfer,Sour Gas Plant Operator (Power Engineer),4,"The plant itself is great, lots of room to move to different areas of the plant and learn about the oil and gas industry. The culture has been on and off the past bit since Energy Transfer purchased SemCams, people blame new management."
Energy Transfer,Buyer,1,"Management Is terrible. They will blame you on everything if you don’t have your dots in a row. The company has gotten worse when they brought on another company. The department is very micromanaged and will talk negative mostly everyday. Education is not valued, will have to work in the office everyday. No work life balance. Benefits are awful. Pay is decent."
Energy Transfer,Marine Terminal operator,2,"The environment lacks the leadership and support needed to ensure success for its employees. Often, double standards are applied for some employees. Extremely under manned and no work life balance."
Energy Transfer,Contracts,2,"Energy Transfer feels like multiple companies bolted together.  Old school mentality - they want you in the office 5 days a week, culture is very ""CYA"".   Promotions are very few and far between."
Energy Transfer,Crude Oil Transport Driver,2,"The management is fake in every sense, stab you in the back in a heart beat. Try to make you think you're not under the gun , you are definitely under the gun. Do not recommend. "
Energy Transfer,Supply Chain Analyst,2,"Please consider finding employment elsewhere. There is no morals, respect with this company. Compensation is the lower than other oil and gas companies. "
Energy Transfer,Senior Driver,4,Great place for self motivated drivers. No micro managing and no cameras. Equipment is getting old. Communication between senior management and drives needs improvement. 
Energy Transfer,Plant Operator,1,"Very unsafe place to work. Near misses are looked over and kept as quiet as possible. Training is done by whoever is in the mood to do a plant walk through. No training outline, no progression outlined in black and white. Plant is left with one operator at times "
Energy Transfer,Corrosion Technician,4,"ETE is a good company.  Other companies may pay more for some positions but the environment and benefits are good.  The trend of companies becoming extremely ""politically correct"" hasn't seemed to effect ETE too much yet. "
Energy Transfer,Lead System Gas Controller,2,Review all your options before considering employment with energy transfer. The pay is not the greatest in the world. You would be better off seeking employment elsewhere.
Energy Transfer,Pipeline Construction Supervisor/ Project Manager,5,"The company does not allow you to go home and  relax , they always expect you to be on call 24_7  and wanting more then what you can put out of your expectations . On the last few years tha I was work with them was getting worse."
Energy Transfer,Field tech,1,"Place was poor at best,  benefits get worse all the time.  Their safety policy and driving policy make it impossible to be in the right all the time.  nearly all salaried employees are extremely arrogant and ""above"" field persons.  Different areas operate completely differently,  one area may allow the companies alternative work schedules and the area next to it may not.  everything is disconnected and most of the assets are 20-30 years behind."
Energy Transfer,I&E Tech,5,The company was a great company to work for. The only thing is was for the GPS in the truck comes unplugged it shows the last location you were at. Which mine came undone and showed my truck home for 50 days. Which is wrong.
Energy Transfer,Pipeline Operator,4,Decent but management is a sham it’s political like everywhere else compensation is not in line with other companies talk about being safe and it’s bull 
New York Life,Financial Services Representative,5,"This is a Fortune 100 company that values their employees, supports them and wants them to succeed. This is especially important because financial services is a tough business. Most people know very little about the scope of what we do, or about our company- that we're owned by our policy owners, not Wall Street, for instance. But people are highly skeptical of ""insurance companies"" and have made assumptions about us, especially thinking that all we do is insurance when we're trained to provide a full range of financial services for individuals and businesses: retirement planning, estate planning, business planning, tax diversification, etc. The company knows this however and supports us. Our training is undisputedly known as the best in the industry. Very deep dives on ethics, products, business management, etc.,--and it's a three year program. We're encouraged to secure securities licenses and they pay for the training. Currently they're also paying bonuses when licenses are secured. Compensation is based on performance, so it's not easy. But, it's possible to make a lot of money. The company pays very well when new business is brought in. Benefits are outstanding! Lastly, this company doesn't just talk diversity they walk the talk. By far the most diverse workforce I've ever seen, top to bottom. No glass ceilings here! All that and we're the gold standard in the industry.- the oldest, largest and financially strongest mutual insurance company in the United States."
New York Life,Registered Representative,4,It’s a fine place to work. A lot depends on your specific office and manager. Definitely have to work hard and can be stressful if you’re not making sales. 
New York Life,Insurance Sales Representative,2,"Great colleagues, but management and products are subpar. Products are not competitive when compared to other companies. Less than 10% of agents across the company/country make 5k+ a month. The average agent earns around $1500-$2,000 a month, do not let management mislead you.Managers make 15-20% override on everything you sell and essentially do nothing but recruit and sit around all day. You are paid 30-55% commission depending on the product. However, if a chargeback occurs 11 months into the policy, they will charge you back more than you were paid in commission in order to cover management's override. In essence, management gets paid no matter what, and you as the agent are responsible for paying their portion of the chargeback. Employee turnover is also atrocious, they will hire anyone with a pulse and a cell phone. Personally saw 75+ agents join and quit in a year or two. "
New York Life,Remote  Universal Agent,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?The small bonus that’s handed out in MarchWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The amount of irate callers that you deal with because the claim manager refuse to answer their phones. Also take 2 days for a call backWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Upper management don’t care about the employees like they say they do. They don’t t base the work on true customer service but on metrics.  They also micromanage to an ungodly degreeWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Get yelled at by callers over not receiving their paperwork, checks, or the manager won’t call them back. Morning meetings to go over metrics instead of how they can truly help the callers. Stress, stress and more stress for low pay"
New York Life,Agent,5,Enjoyable to work at and i always get the suport that i need wherher it be with a client ot any new prospects. It is a very family friendy place to be at
New York Life,Registered Representative & Financial Planner,3,"Good sales skills are necessary. Good support for education and getting designations.  Great coworker culture.  Good supervisors and proctoring.  A great place to learn.  But to survive, making good sales is essential."
New York Life,Google Specialist,5,"I am honored to join the company and be a member. As a worker, I feel honored.On the first day of employment, the company organized a new employee training, which made me have a preliminary understanding of the company's business and culture. [Describe the training content, e.g., company history, core values, product introduction, etc.] My colleagues were very warm and friendly and actively helped me to integrate into the new working environment."
New York Life,Financial Professional / Licensed Life Agent,3,"This is one industry that remains stuck in the past. Business formal dress code (enforced), materialistic incentives to meet sales quotas, and high turnover. If you can get triggered and finally make commission and gain access to stipends, you might survive your first year. "
New York Life,Insurance Agent,3,"Working as an insurance agent is tough no matter where you go. And it's great to be with a company that provides good sales training classes, etc...and New York Life does that. However, meeting the various quotas to get promoted is a tough game of chasing leads, many futile appointments, and learning to handle rejections...plus, the products are often expensive. However, if you succeed, it can be a lucrative career...but the pressure to meet quotas never goes away even when you're climbing to the next level. Remember, you must ""always be closing""...because it's a sales job."
New York Life,Financial Professional,5,"Attending zooms, on my phone/computer anywhere or be in office at a cubicle. Advancing education, continued credentials, and hosting meetings with clients and prospects in general. Help people make some of the most important decisions of their life. Getting paid to meet and talk with people. "
New York Life,Insurance Agent,1,No training and only wanted to sell to family and friends no leads given never helped prospects. The bad was getting paid before a policy was officially funded and taken by customers had to give money back to the company if a deal fell through 
New York Life,Agent,4,"Great atmosphere, nice managers and helpful coworkers. Only downside is its commission only and not for someone who isn't willing to put in 10 hour days in the beginning. Cold calling is a must in this industry as well as doing seminars and other outside events like street fairs, bridal shows, air shows, etc. In order to find clients and make any money. Any promotion as well as your pension is based on what you produce for the company. So if you are promoted to a manager they will pay you what your average salary was for the 3 best years as an agent. As long as you work hard this job can be amazing for you. If you are not motivated in this field then it is definitely not for you. "
New York Life,Analista,4,Very good company worry about people and their clear people that you have to work like any company but it is good and beautiful you can always do better
New York Life,Agent,4,The job is difficult because you have to find pretty much all your leads but the management does help because most of them used to be in the same position and understand the struggles. Be ready for rejection and a lot of ups and downs in this business. 
New York Life,Senior Associate,4,"Company is well established with great benefits and decent compensation.  The culture was patriarchal but, obviously, it could be different depending on which department and location you are working from."
New York Life,Agent,5,The best support and training. Prior sells experience and access to affluent market will help you succeed! I loved the company and atmosphere. Very professional. 
New York Life,Life Insurance Agent,1,"New York Life is a predatory company that milks its employees for all their worth and guarantees absolutely nothing in return. Here’s what you can expect if you make the mistake of working for them. In order to go “full-time,” you will be pressured to give up the personal information of as many people as you can. The company will own your book of business, and wash their hands of you if you leave the company. If a policy lapses or is cancelled for any reason, you are liable to return 100% of your commission to the company regardless of the effort you put in. You will be encouraged to “invest in your business” by paying for leads, events, advertising, etc., and you will be given little in the way of meaningful support. I could go on about how awful this company truly is, but I’ll cut myself short. The life insurance industry has an incredibly high turnover rate, and it’s no wonder why when companies like New York Life exist."
New York Life,Insurance Agent,5,"Overall, working at New York Life has been a highly rewarding experience. The combination of an exceptional management team and outstanding training programs creates a thriving work environment."
New York Life,Agent,3,"I wouldn't say my experience has been good or bad, just interesting. The job is not at all how it was portrayed to me during the interview process. I was led to believe that we received leads and got a base salary with ""commission bonuses"" on top. That is not at all how it works, with my small natural market, I am really struggling, but keep getting told that ""you'll figure it out"". The commission reversals are also a killer. Feels like working for free most days, and is 1000% a HUSTLE."
New York Life,Insurance Agent,2,"Taugh, hard, making money depends on your abilities to sale, you can learn a lot. It is difficult, specially at the begining, but if you are willing to learn, you can make it "

New York Life,Clerical,4,"-A typical day at work would consist of a team meeting in the morning, reading incoming e-mails and completing daily work.  Another team meeting in the afternoon.  -After 24 years of service and being the essential worker during COVID for 2.5 years by myself.  During which there were NO issues of any kind.  Now, My ""NEW"" Service Leader was NOT helpful at all in assisting me in correcting issues at hand,  they did not bring any issues to my attention until several months later which does not give me any chance to make corrections.  When I asked my service leader to just let me know when I do make an error... all they could say is: I'm Not that type of person. This again does NOT give me any chance to improve or even any indication that I have made any errors. "

New York Life,New York life,3,"The work itself wasn’t too bad, but the management needs an overhaul. It seems they were always looking to downsize with staff, increasing the work load and with minimal “cost of living” salary increases."
New York Life,Agent,1,"New York Life preys on your hopes and dreams of being financially independent and successful. Many times I have met clients who only need life insurance and I can do that for them. New York Life does not allow the agents to just give clients life insurance. You have to convince the client to set a “appointment” to walk them through the process and give an entire financial needs analysis even though the agent is only licensed for life insurance and can only sell life insurance. No managers are concerned about the agents making any money. Not until the managers weren’t making any money off the agents that they were pressing the agents. This job does not work for someone who is not already financially stable and does not have a broad network of people to work with. The word that all the managers say is, “It just takes time”. Ok, well how am I supposed to pay rent? FYI, with the TAS maximizer plan you get 80% of FYC (has to be a minimum of 500 in FYC to even get the bonus). FYC equates to 50% of the annual premium off a sale. So once you make 500FYC in one month then you get that 80%. So 500 + 400 = $900 take home that month. It’s bullsh*t. "

New York Life,NC/SC Licensed Life Insurance Agent,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Educating customers about how to properly protect themselves and their family. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?No guaranteed paycheck and no payments for all the driving or work-related costs you have to incur in order to secure appts with your potential customers.  It was the WORST!What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Horrible work environment...just making phone calls or emailing/using social media while sitting smack dab next to another agent doing the same. And being forced to come into the office to make these calls and attend trainings, again when I could do both at home saving me time and money that I did not get reimbursed for, was a huge issue. I will say the training was great though.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Make calls to set up appts to meet with potential customers to sell life insurance or fixed annuities.  Boring part."
New York Life,Claims Manager,4,Training for was great! After training you are basically thrown into the claims jungle. They say they will start you with the easier claims but they keep stacking them on. When you are out unexpectedly for sickness or kids sick you will still have claims to work when you come back making your workload even more. 
New York Life,Registered Representative,1,"It is not a good place to work. I just recently graduated college and I spent 1 year working before I was able to leave. They promise that you’ll make around $100K first-year, which is near impossible to accomplish. Also, they promote a $500/week stipend, but you need to have enough production to be eligible for that, which defeats the whole point of it being used as a safety net."

New York Life,Financial Professional,1,"Worst part is that New York Life is a captive company. You are entirely alone and get no leads to help build a client base. You will always find good and bad people to work with. Unfortunately, the Johnstown office has what seems like a high school clique system. If you aren't good enough in their eyes, you'll be excluded from everything and they will completely turn their backs on you. If they don't think you're actually fit for being an agent, they won't give you the time or day to get help. They'll pay for your licensing, but then expect you to just jump into it and be selling policies left and right. Once one person has a problem with you, the entire company has a problem with you. They require you to have an experienced agent with you to sign your first few policies, but nobody is ever available to meet with your clients. The recruiters make money off of any policies you sign. It's ran like an MLM/pyramid scheme. It has potential. But at the end of the day, they don't actually care about their clients, only their bank accounts."
New York Life,Senior Benefits Specialist,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The best job I have ever held.

New York Life,Financial Services Representative,5,"This is a Fortune 100 company that values their employees, supports them and wants them to succeed. This is especially important because financial services is a tough business. Most people know very little about the scope of what we do, or about our company- that we're owned by our policy owners, not Wall Street, for instance. But people are highly skeptical of ""insurance companies"" and have made assumptions about us, especially thinking that all we do is insurance when we're trained to provide a full range of financial services for individuals and businesses: retirement planning, estate planning, business planning, tax diversification, etc. The company knows this however and supports us. Our training is undisputedly known as the best in the industry. Very deep dives on ethics, products, business management, etc.,--and it's a three year program. We're encouraged to secure securities licenses and they pay for the training. Currently they're also paying bonuses when licenses are secured. Compensation is based on performance, so it's not easy. But, it's possible to make a lot of money. The company pays very well when new business is brought in. Benefits are outstanding! Lastly, this company doesn't just talk diversity they walk the talk. By far the most diverse workforce I've ever seen, top to bottom. No glass ceilings here! All that and we're the gold standard in the industry.- the oldest, largest and financially strongest mutual insurance company in the United States."

New York Life,Financial Services Representative,3,"An Honest Review for Future Job Seekers-Education and Training:New York Life offers an unparalleled educational experience. The comprehensive curriculum is applicable across various industries, ensuring that whatever path you choose after your tenure here, you will excel.-Initial Experience:When you first join, the company imbues you with a sense of invincibility. The onboarding process is motivating, with promises of financial success and the opportunity to make a meaningful difference. Your managers feel like the mentors you've always dreamed of having. - Sales Dynamics:The role begins by leveraging your personal network—starting with your closest friends and family—and then expanding as per the company's strategy. However, the product you sell is notoriously difficult, which can strain personal relationships and impact your reputation.- Compensation and Work Environment:The company neither allows you to have another job nor offers a salary. It is entirely commission based. During slow periods, you're made to feel that failure is entirely your fault given the calibre of your training, which can be demoralizing. The financial strain is significant, as you often end up spending more than you earn. Depending on your location and demographics, you might feel socially isolated from your management team.- Work Culture:The transition from being seen as a promising new recruit to feeling like a failure can be swift and harsh, often feeling akin to gaslighting. While the company boasts about inclusivity, this is primarily evident in big cities. Managers' elitist attitudes - more..."
New York Life,Agent,2,Needs improvement in having more joint work with newer agents. Have leads for those that don't have a large natural market. Too many support fees. Partners also asking how may they assist but don't give suggestions on how they can assist especially when new and not having a full understanding.  Trainings are improving but still needs improvement. Make sure to go with a partner that has truly worked as an agent and understands the hardships and able to give you ways to make money. Connection is key. If you have a great network and they trust you and they know you can help beyond life insurance then this is a good company.  The products are great. Service centers could use improvement. Make sure you have about 3-6 months of money put away before starting. You have to be a true entrepreneur for this position because you have to hustle. 100% COMMISSION The training allowance you get is only if you sell products.
New York Life,Customer Service Representative,1,"Poor management with very little constructive feedback. Micromanagement on minutia. They spent most of their time monitoring how long people were in the restroom. The vast majority of people I worked around didn't need to be monitored. They were professional adults who followed the rules. Management, unfortunately, saw everyone as a number."
New York Life,Licensed Service Assistant/Secretary,5,"Typical days at work were very busy and fast paced. Deadlines had to be met, the sooner the better. Making sure to live up to the highest ethical standards was extremely important. I enjoyed all aspects of my job especially dealing with and helping clients with any and all questions or concerns they had. The clients trusted me to take care of everything meticulously because I always did. The hardest part of the job was sometimes the workplace environment and coworkers being frustrated. "
New York Life,Agent,2,"The training program is excellent, but the company has many misleading managers and a very political environment. They encourage you to use your personal connections to make sales.

If you don't feel comfortable trying to manipulate your loved ones into spending hundreds of dollars a month this job probably isn't for you."
New York Life,Senior Claims Examiner,2,"Sadly there are so many people in management that do not care, are ineffective at their jobs and bring the company to a low level.

New York Life,Registered Representative,3,"Solid Highest rated company. From an FA perspective, marketing support is generic and outdated. This is critical as the only ""hard work"" is consistently generating enough qualified, and engaged people to talk to. This is the real job. Prospecting and Selling. Very old 1980s way of generating prospects with your warm market. There are some inbound leads, but they are few and very far in between. So you can't depend on them. But if you can develop your own systematic way of consistently generating 30-40 new engaged prospects every single week that you can then convert to appointments, you will make money. Honestly it's one of the best Insurance Companies in existence. Especially their whole life. NYL Insurance contracts are better, but you'll pay a higher price. But if your not an extrovert with a large warm market it will be incredibly difficult for you to generate business in the beginning. There are some good people there. And if you can succeed there, you can succeed anywhere and write your own ticket. "
New York Life,Advisor,5,Great team to work with. You're surrounded by people in both the Charlotte office and the Manhattan office who do their best to help you succeed. Couldn't have asked for more. 
New York Life,Janitor,5,"Not much to do, cleanliness 10/10. Det hårdest part was finding something to do as there was a strong culture around cleaning up after themselves. Did fix a few light bulbs though."
New York Life,Analyst,2,"Productive and fun workplaceVery goodThere’s a lot of growth in this place, salaries are high. It’s very nice to work here, I recommend it to everyone really"
New York Life,Life Insurance Agent,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Building relationships with other agentsWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Inconsistent and lack of support from the Management team. They are working from an out-of-date playbook. A clear absence of personal development within the Management team.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?They preach in lock-step the company's message but have little to no self-awareness.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Research opportunities in the market, make calls, follow up, and meet people face-to-face or remotely. Weekly meetings with the Management team. Research other avenues of prospects. Learn from others. It's an adversarial environment. You won't find any real team support here. Study products. Rinse and repeat."
New York Life,Financial Professional ,3,"The job has its benefits, but getting started is difficult and your experience can vary depending on who hires you. When you are going through the hiring process, it is not specified that you won't get paid your training allowance until you reach a commission amount. So you'll go without pay until you have have earned about $3000 in commission. Commission rate is good when you are able to sign people up for policies. People are nice, but there is a subtle vibe of duplicitousness. They act like your friend, but will hound you and guilt you for struggling to find clients. If you just want to make money and believe you can just ignore some negative aspects, then it can be the career for you. You can learn quite a bit about finance from here, depending on who you talk to. Some of the managers seem more like sales people than financial experts. The other agents are typically easy to get along with so the workplace environment is pretty welcoming."
New York Life,Licensed Insurance Producer,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The ability to work at my schedule and earn uncapped income.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Earning according to production.

They believe in scheduling your day down to the minute!What is a typical day like for you at the company?Onboarding class 1st thing, then make calls or nest to capture names and appointments"

New York Life,Insurance Agent,5,"You definitely reap what you sow here.  Get to work doing what your partner recommends.  Excellent leadership and mentoring in the DG General Office.The hardest part is getting people to meet with you.  Set appointments, you’ll do really well."
New York Life,Customer Service Representative,3,Busy days. Nice coworkers. Decent working location. Clean building. Nice mirrors in the bathrooms for selfies. A lot of information crammed into a short period of time for training. Call center was always cold. Being on the phones all day was a challenge.

New York Life,Financial Professional,1,Dont do it… if you were to calculate the hourly rate it’s about 5$you only make money if you bring a lot of people in or can convince people to give you $1000 a month for insurance they don’t need
New York Life,Agent,2,not worth the time you put in to be a captive agent with no direction and consistent micromanagement. they promise a salary and turn around and offer you commission only. Could go on and on...
New York Life,CVP,5,"They still offers pension benefit, which is based on cash value. Employer will contribute a certain percentage each year. Not many companies do that these days."
New York Life,Long Term Disability Claim Manager,5,"I’ve been with NYL as an LTD claims manager for about 2yrs now and it’s been a great experience so far. My management is fair, our metrics and expectations are fair and they allow for a fairly decent work life balance. "

They do not provide leads and if you are unable to find people, you will not make any money.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Fast and high energy..  there are a number of in-person meetings at the office. And they expect you to dress up"
New York Life,Sales Agent,1,"There seems to be an ever-changing bait and switch at the company. Before joining you're told not to quit your day job the first year, because it may take months to Trigger and secure a monthly stipend. The issue with that is the Non-Stop meetings that you must attend that jeopardize the very meeting management tells you not to quit. Management then gives a vague explanation that you can miss meetings under EXTENUATING circumstances, but won't provide a list of what that is predicated on. The next issue is the promise that once you TRIGGER you will have access to a list of potential prospects, only to be told ""You are too new to have access"" Yet before triggering management dangles that carrot in front of you, only to tell you later you don't qualify. "
New York Life,Corporate Vice President,3,"The culture has changed due to all of the changes. People are being pushed out. Despite record-setting year, raises were incredibly disappointing. I do not recommend. "
New York Life,Life & Health Insurance Agent,2,"Regardless of the contract you signed during study. You do not make any money unless you sell a policy To anyone even though you're learning. You will not make money while you are studying unless you sell a policy and you are starting to learn how to sell policies. You don't get to learn about the product that you're expected to sell until after you've been selling the products. If someone stops paying on their policy before the year and you received commission for that policy, the commission is removed and you are negative on your ledger. "
New York Life,Financial Agent,4,"The work culture is positive, but do your trainings and compliance requirements. One mistake or misstep can get you terminated and you manager can’t help. You will feel like the rug guy pulled from under you. The company also offers a stipend. But what they don’t tell you, is that it’s taxed and you have to be proactive to get. If you aren’t you will feel like you are playing catch up forever.You have to create your own market, they say you’re running it like your own business but that not the case. The only time you operate it like it’s your own is the market you choose. Everything else, they call the shots. You have to do what is expected of you. Manager style plays a huge role in your success."
New York Life,Short Term Disability Case Manager,4,"New York Life is amazing about hiring internally, there’s an amazing work life balance, good pay, flexible schedule. Only downside is sudden changes in the approach to things or how things need to get done in your day to day routine."
New York Life,Insurance Agent,2,"In the life insurance field, there's a notable 5-8% success rate for new agents making it to year 2, and this extends beyond just NYL.While selling insurance products may seem straightforward, it's actually quite challenging. Being an agent is more about prospecting than straight sales. Furthermore, being a partner is more akin to a recruiting role rather than developing a team, which can be difficult for new agents if they're paired with the wrong partner - it's somewhat luck of the draw. I consider myself fortunate to have found a solid partner, but even with that advantage, the challenges persist.While New York Life (NYL) offers solid training and opportunities to learn about the industry, there's not a significant difference between them and other major players in the field. It's wise to enter with an exit strategy in mind before diving in."""
New York Life,Insurance Agent,5,"I loved working at New York life, management was great, everyone was very welcoming and friendly. There training can be a bit better, as most of it is through CBT. You need to have the right connections to make a great living, their commission arrangements are good. "
New York Life,Financial Analyst,4,You have to put in the work to succeed that’s for sure. They deff sell you a dream but the training is good the rest is up to you. This job isn’t built for everybody.
New York Life,Life Insurance Solutions Customer Service Associate,4,I enjoyed my job. My manager was young and had no interpersonal skills. He was all about the “numbers” (i.e METRICS). Working here taught me to make sure all things said to me are in writing for my own record keeping!
New York Life,Agent,3,"Nice company, good training, and supportive management and partners. However, commissions are difficult to earn, and finding customers, as well as leads, is very challenging. Before entering this field, it's essential to have some savings because it takes at least 6 to 9 months to start earning income, and more than 1.5 years to earn enough just to survive. Additionally, you'll need to work long hours, typically around 16 hours per day, with the hope of eventually achieving a modest income. It may take up to 10 years to earn enough for a comfortable living. Lastly, be prepared for uncomfortable situations with friends and relatives, as they may often be asked to buy products."

American Express,Platinum Care Professional,2,"Alright, the culture has certainly shifted for a while now... Not what used to be - management does not care about your growth as an individual! You will not succeed."
American Express,Project Manager,5,I've worked for Amex going on 25 years. It's not unusual to meet people who have been with the company over 30 years. Leadership works hard to create a positive environment and there are career growth opportunities- especially here in Phoenix.

American Express,American Express TLS Boutique,5,There are 2 mandatory 15 min breaks and lunch is a strict 30 minutes HOWEVER the commissary in Sunrise is like a division 1 university cafeteria. There are so many delicious options to choose from and the company gives you $15 to spend for lunch daily.It’sa HUGE benefit.The trainers and coaches are exceptionally qualified and experienced and are truly motivated to help us be successful.The teasing program is steel jar and makes you well prepared for your role and the OJT is extremely beneficial for your growth to being independent and as profitable as possible.Work in the office only 3 days per week and 2 days from home.
American Express,Engineer,5,Great Company to work for. Good Work life balance. Employee care. Good hikes and promotions based on individual performance..Value for the company is also Good.
American Express,Sales Representative,3,Helping clients with their travel needs was rewarding. It also gave me new ideas and I learned tips  and became more efficient at planning my own vacations. 
American Express,Travel Consultant,1,Treated like a number and unrealistic expectations. Not given time to complete job task. Bonus are promised but the expectations to achieve earning a bonus are unrealistic. Every call is micromanaged 
American Express,Engineer - React/Javascript,5,"A typical day at work involved collaborative meetings and project updates, fostering a dynamic environment. I learned the importance of adaptability and effective communication. Management was supportive, promoting growth and innovation. The workplace culture emphasized teamwork and inclusivity, making everyone feel valued. The hardest part of the job was balancing tight deadlines with quality expectations. However, the most enjoyable aspect was celebrating team successes and building lasting relationships with colleagues."
American Express,Software Engineer,5,My team and the managers was great and helpful. I work for such a long time for more than 3 years in different projects. I have learnt a lot from the projects and my teammates.
American Express,Account Services Representative,1,"Typical days are full of supporting clients who need help with various card or loan related services. The clients are great to work with, and appreciate your efforts. Management is entirely self-focused, and treats Diversity Inclusion as a recent fad.  Micromanagement and toxicity are commonplace, and leadership culture is to accept no responsibility, and share no credit.  Who you know outweighs what you know or how you do your job.The hardest part of the job is not knowing who you can trust, and who you can ask for help.  The best part of the job is when you can help a client, and you know you have made their day a little less stressful.  "
American Express,ventas y atencion al cliente,1,"If what you want is to be exploited, humiliated, harassed and occasionally obtain profits ... This is the perfect place!You have to invest at least 2 months in transport, meals and others because they pay you the minimum even when you are already selling, there is no voice or vote, they offer you a few hours of day but the favorites allow them to spend more time until they reach the goals,advice if you are going to enter ... Prepare your highest self -esteem and prepare to be the product"
American Express,Account Development Manager,1,"Employees here thinks they are the best because of Amex brand but they know nothing, they will screw the brand value soon enough. if you want to ruin your future please consider joining this pathetic organisation"
American Express,Risk Manager,5,Enjoyed the 12 years at AXP.  Worked in multiple positions and can share it was like working in a tight family.  All are responsible and are willing to grow together.  It is truly a great place to work!
American Express,Talent Acquisition Partner,5,"I've been working at American Express for several years, and it has been a truly rewarding experience. The company offers outstanding benefits, including comprehensive health coverage, generous paid time off, and support for professional development. The work environment is inclusive and collaborative, making it a place where I feel valued and motivated every day.One of the things I appreciate most is the company's commitment to employee well-being. Whether it's through wellness programs, flexible work arrangements, or the support from leadership, I always feel that my personal and professional growth is a priority here.Additionally, the team spirit and sense of camaraderie among colleagues make it a joy to come to work. It's a place where hard work is recognized, and there are ample opportunities for career advancement.Overall, American Express is a fantastic place to build a career, with great benefits and a positive culture that truly cares about its employees."
American Express,Travel Consultant,1,"Metrics are beyond unrealistic. They are designed for failure. More importantly, they are not considerate of the actual cardmember. The main goal seems to be to roll through calls as fast as possible, when it should be about efficiency and quality service. Cardmembers are given the impression that this is a full service travel agency - when in reality it is a call center. Agents are pressured to get on to the next call, not properly document things and absolutely discouraged for callbacks or followups. All this makes the job incredibly stressful. Leadership does not have any experience in the role they are actually overseeing. Team leaders for the most part have been hired outside the company, and although they have management experience, they have little to no knowledge of the travel industry or being on the phones. This also indicates that the company rarely promotes from within, and therefore has no interest in fostering employee growth. Mass firings and layoffs have also been an issue working here. Many of my colleagues (who are fantastic agents that genuinely care about their card members) were fired or let go for for no reason at all with no notice. Their jobs were then outsourced outside the US. If you are virtual, expect to be expendable in Amex's eyes. Its pretty sad that the people who worked hard and got the company through the pandemic were cast out so quickly. Promotions or movement between departments is currently only reserved for hybrid or onsite agents.The hard truth is that I do not have one happy colleague. They are all burnt out and depressed. I would - more..."
American Express,Dispute Resolution Specialist,5,Amazing work environment and a great place to work. Management is terrific and work life balance at its best. As a call center changing schedules fairly regularly is the only gripe
American Express,Analyst Service Performance,5,"From the lowest to the highest levels in hierarchy, they care about staff, excellent benefits, they are flexible in granting permits whenever you are from the collaborators who also support."
American Express,Representante de Servicio al Cliente,5,"What is the best thing about working in the company?Work in the company? Excellent atmosphere, culture of respect among employees. How is a typical day for you in the company? How CCP, connect in time, be ready for a day full of challenges in calls."
American Express,Sales Manager,5,Great environment to learn in. Quality management and career opportunities. Global opportunities very interesting. Training and clear job responsibilities a plus. 
American Express,Underwriting Coordinator,3,When I first started it was great but after getting new management the department has gone down the hill. It’s as if we are just a number now. It’s no room for growth or anything 
American Express,Marketing Intern,3,"Pros: good mentorshipCons: not very competitive pay, they keep interns around for little pay and no promise of full time offer. Some of the co workers are rude and seem to be cliquey "
American Express,Credit Analyst,5,"Great work environment & great benefits. They provide you the training you need to succeed. As well as, they offer great benefits to help balance your home/work life. "
American Express,Software Engineer,4,"Loved working at American Express, the team was amazing and management was engaged and invested in my success. I did end up burning out by the end but it’s the software industry after all"
American Express,Travel Consultant,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Work from home was the best part.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Unfair job, system horrible, no assistance and no help What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The worse, very stressful, there is no positive environment What is a typical day like for you at the company?To many rules for less time of work"
American Express,Analista de Prevención de Fraudes,5,"In case the company is good, the salary is decent but the workload is usually very heavy much requirement I liked to find my best friend the food time is almost always paid sooner and you enter early because you must cover 48 hours butYou have 2 days on the view to the city is beautiful"
American Express,Customer Service Representative,1,"They pay is good but they will fire you at any time.   I was there 2 years and was ranked in the top 10 of agents per metrics and I was fired because i didn't upsell people to the next card enough.  The customer service position is a sales position and you are expected to upsell a certain amount of inbound callers to the next level card all while doing regular customer service   Back to Back calls from the start of shift to the end, it never stops.   The managers are nice but they all have the same mission, sell.  I would not think of it as a long term career,  if you are looking for experience, it pays well, the benefits are nice but VERY stressful.   "
American Express,Customer Service Coach,5,"Good work life balance, a large amount of projects that lack purpose and many changes, miserable communication between departments can give it a tedious feel, very good treatment of employees generally and lovely colleagues. Would always work their again."
American Express,Ejecutivo de Cuenta,4,"Good in pay but it was decreasing by structuring of the company, but its benefits are magnificent.For assistance issues there are good personnel but the high -ranking few are sensitive"
American Express,Clerk,3,Good job. Good pay. Good benefits. Can't get Sunday off. Have to work every Sunday. It's real annoying... But it's fun. The people are really nice to work with 
American Express,Financial Analyst,4,Lots of perks. Room to grow and opportunity to relocate. Very community oriented with volunteer time to give back. Flexible holidays and inclusive environment 
American Express,Customer Service Representative,2,"I worked with American Express at BGC. It is not fund to work here. You can try but don't stay for too long as it will give you trauma. The pay is not generous anymore since the pandemic.Mandatory Overtime, Weekend meetings without pay! You'll be forced to participate in donations related to the company."
American Express,Customer Care Representative,2,Management sucks from leader to OM. No work life balance. No considerations and no concerns to your health. Causing anxiety to employee.They're just good in  micromanaging.  Ethics team doesnt care/listen about the reports. 
American Express,Travel & Lifestyle Consultant,2,"They’re more worried about meeting metrics than actually meeting client needs. Higher ups set unrealistic metric expectations when they aren’t on the phones dealing with clients, and navigating through calls. The money was amazing but the stress wasn’t worth it at all. I was actually relieved to take a small break after they let me go due to not meeting metrics for 6 months straight. Oh, and I had to come up with ways to improve. The lead did nothing but try to force answers out of me as to why I couldn’t bring the numbers up. Good luck! "
American Express,Software Engineer,4,Seeking mentorship is easy and you can grow quickly that way. Starting off depending on the team not much is expected. Participate in Scrum ceremonies and take up your user stories. Yearly pay increases are supposedly non negotiable but I haven't tried. Great place to start. Great culture. Note: Team dependent documentation is missing most of the time. Unless team uses a handbook. 
American Express,Freelance,5,Well and you are very good so that nothing competition is said and you have no competition to feel better and you don't have to use the phone
American Express,Team Leader,1,"It was a great school, a great learning, they are not valuing talent, they are letting people go.They have changed human strategy to become a pure and hard business.They do not encourage the employee, their positions are already at the level of the industry in salaries, there are no commissions, elimination of positions, bonds.Good company to learn but not to grow because there is little opportunity."
American Express,CCP,5,All good. Compensation is good but need more flexibility on schedule arrangement. Can be overbearing at times and especially if need to skip lunch time during on call.
American Express,Travel Consultant,1,-Typical day at work- You take call after call and are not given enough time to service the client. Just when you are overwhelmed in your department they overload you with a different departments calls that you aren't knowledgable to take. They are firing their virtual US agents and outsourcing to Mexico and Manilla.-Management- they fired their senior managers - again no job security. They replaced them with newer hires from a different department that do not know or have access to half of what we do.- They change your schedule to one you do not want and will never see your family-The most enjoyable part pod the job is when I am on vacation.- The hardest part of the job- none of it is easy.
American Express,Customer Service Professional,1,"It was a pleasure to work with the customers and to do the tasks, but because of unhealthy work environment I chose to resign. If the company could focus on hiring people who are both professionals and team-workers, it could be a really good place to work."
American Express,Analyst,5,"Their customer service is second to none.” “The product quality is consistently outstanding, exceeding my expectations every time.” “I was completely impressed with their professionalism and customer service"
American Express,Account Manager,3,american express is a worldwide company and has been established for years so you can expect from a historical global company it can be. people working there are helpful to each other and nothing special to complain of.
American Express,Travel Consultant,5,Great teamLeaders  and training programs lots of support both with on job and tech Fun place to work great office environment Achieve high compliance and standards for quarterly bonuses No fam trips available for several years Remote and hybrid work opportunities 
American Express,Credit Analyst,5,"Great work environment & great benefits. They provide you the training you need to succeed. As well as, they offer great benefits to help balance your home/work life. "
American Express,Account Specialist,5,It was fun and innovative. You get to meet a lot of different people (backgrounds) and experiences. I would highly recommend anyone to apply and enjoy their time there. 
American Express,Senior Project Manager,3,What is the best part of working at the company?The company image and branding made it feel like you were working at a premium Fortune 500 company. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Incompetent leadership. Was discrimanated.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Most of my time with the company was during Covid. Zero culture. What is a typical day like for you at the company?It was great working on large projects. Felt important.
American Express,Promoter,1,Horrenda experience with zero interest for the worker
American Express,UX Design Operations Program Manager,5,Amex is a wonderful company and I learned so much here. Really took off in my User Experience Career Path. The leaders were excellent and supportive. And the colleagues were great!
American Express,"Manejo de información confidencial, servicio al cliente",3,"A day of work can be stressful in general, everything is treatment by phone so you go against time.I learned a little in my post but not enough after 5 years.Management has very bad habits, the most marked that anyone's personal life cares, nor that of employees, or that of clients.The company's culture does not apply.The most difficult part of the employment is that you have to like everyone if you want to change your position."
American Express,Collections ,4,Job had pretty good pay but wasn’t worth the headaches and poor management.  the training was not put together well and not very well thought out. When it came to the real job you were left with having to do the complete opposite than what you were told to do in training. 
American Express,Agent Insight Business Manager,5,"American Express Business Travel offers an enticing compensation package with excellent pay, making it a rewarding place to work financially. However, the PTO structure feels outdated and could benefit from modernization to better align with contemporary work-life balance expectations. Management is attentive and receptive to employee feedback, fostering a positive and supportive work environment. The travel perks are outstanding, you have ability to use the points you earn personally is a fantastic bonus, adding extra value to the overall experience."
American Express,Travel Counselor I,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The benefits were amazing and start day one. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?You have an average of 18 minutes to handle a call. Calls can last for several hours if you have someone that is indecisive or really doesn't have all the information needed to book their travel, if you have to call an airline you might be on hold for several hours (there's no secret number to get you through faster), if you have to call a hotel to inquire about the property it can take several minutes to get through.  They set unrealistic expectations for you to meet and they don't have any real support for their agents. The system they use doesn't provide correct information for you truly assist your callers with the right information such as cancelation policies for airlines or hotels. It's just terrible.  What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful and very unsupported for their agents. What is a typical day like for you at the company?You are on the phone from the start of your shift to the end due to poor scheduling on the part of management.  Depending on the call you may be on a call for an extended period of time because you are unable to get the correct information needed in the system so you'll have to reach out to another company (airline, hotel,  or car rental company) to ensure you provide the caller with what they need all while trying to make sure you follow the compliance process. It is very very stressful."
American Express,Agent Insight Business Manager,4,I started in 2020 and it was rocky at first with the M&A and the lock downs. Now that we are back on track it was my favorite job. You own your own business and you can pretty much write your ticket. 
American Express,Analyst,5,"The data work is kinda repetitive, the data cleaning work and all may seems boring, but the company has great culture and work life balance, pay is also good."
American Express,Bobcat Operator,5,they were really good at doing what they did and really effective at retaining customers 5 stars cuz its fun to work there and they give quality ensurance
American Express,Travel Consultant,5,Good place to work. Nice pay great hours . 24 hr service. Weekend work hrs. Team sometimes is not a good help. Very high expectations. Remote but very stressful environment. 
American Express,Analista de Fraudes,3,"I learned a lot but they load you with a lot of work and they are demanding with the service you provide, I considered that the pay and benefits as good but now being in another company with the same turn and similar position I realize that the salary is rather low.The company has many activities and focus a lot on the business culture that you put on your shirt and you feel that you belong to one of the best companies.It is a very good company and it gives you a lotYou can arrive."
American Express,Fraud Analyst,4,this was a fun place to work at. I enjoyed everything about it. especially the time off. I had weekends off and my shifts were in the morning so it was a nice change
American Express,Representante de Atención a Clientes,5,"It is a company that really cares about you as an employee, you learn a lot, good benefits superior to the law, competitive salary, pleasant atmosphere."
American Express,Fraud Analyst,3,Not bad not great. A lot of over time that’s isn’t really an option. Great food for employees pretty often and upward movement is a definitely something you can do. 
American Express,Customer Service Representative,5,Loved working there. Only left due to schedule conflicts. Went from working 1st to 2nd shift. The company was a great place to work at. I really enjoyed the management staff there.
American Express,Underwriter,2,Working for Underwriter Representative for over 2 years. Management has changed over a dozen times a year and day to process never stay the same. There is no consistency and you are treated as a number. Management is only looking out for themselves and their numbers. There is no assistance in advancement it’s all on yourself to figure out who to speak to or how to get further information on other opportunities. You get 2 hours a month for any type of off the job training and they only look out for favorites. There is a reason people work there for over 5 years with no promotional opportunities. 
American Express,Representante comercial,1,"What is the best thing to work in the company? Autonomy, pay the salary without delay, more of the same thing is the most stressful of working in the company? That you are still a number, they do not have to do with customer situations orWith your work, this is how the clients that are are the ones who put the number. How are the environment and work culture in the company? Is the same as any other company, nothing relevant the truth. In your case, howIt is a typical day in the company? Nothing from the other world, stress, full pressure, decide for you, do not give the client's reaction time."
American Express,Sales Associate,4,"It’s was okay I guess… not too bad not too good but okay I guess it’s my elections so it’s okay overall, be careful that’s  all you have more of a life "
American Express,Credit Analyst,5,"Great work environment & great benefits. They provide you the training you need to succeed. As well as, they offer great benefits to help balance your home/work life. "
American Express,Corporate Travel Agent,4,Great company to work with they lack in work /life balance and pay raises I found that they wanted more work from the employees but there were no raises or bonuses 
American Express,Team Leader,4,Was a great place to work with benefits and pay. But with the change of the old Guards it has changed. Old management took care of employees it was people first with situations and concerns they were true people leaders. Now it feels as management is all about self promotion and what they can get out of it. I feel decisions are being made for self promotion and not the benefit of the customer nor the internal employees. Too much stress. New management is too smart for their own good and will run departments and morale down while trying fake motivation. You’re losing a lot of good employees and it will hurt the bottom line as the customer service that is given will decline and that will hurt shareholders and employees morale. They speak about team but it is an individual mentality of how can they influence and climb up the ladder with any means possible. The down fault will be management and the mis management of employees as people first is not on there mind but how can I move up in the company and get a promotion. All in all this was one of the best places and experience to work but with management direction it has changed and hiding it as progression is not they way. Bring back leadership that truly wanted to make a difference. CEO and below have no real understanding of what is going on as they only hear and see what lower management shows and that is sad as I do believe the CEO is a great person and he still values the people. 
American Express,Software Engineer,5,The culture at AMEX is amazing. The team are super supportive and they always motivate to learn and grow. I love the team spirit and their dedication to work. 
American Express,agile champion,5,"They continually push the boundaries in their industry by introducing cutting-edge technologies that not only enhance their product offerings but also revolutionize the customer experience.

American Express,Business lending,5,"Each day was a challenge, however it was a great opportunity to get into. Most people don’t enjoy development and strive for success.

I book air,hotel, rental cars, limos,escorted tours, custom tours, cruises, yachts, villas, air exchanges, & tours. Need to research, qualify client, book, follow through with payments and follow up after trip.Write up proposals & email clients. Figure out accounting for all trips and document everything. Include all different card benefits for every card type.Need to know all card benefits as well and must de-esculate angry customers that are not yours. Managment is there only to scrutinize every move you make listening to your calls looking for negatives. They question your every minute and penalize you for not going to break on time even though you are assisting a client. Then be prepared tp have your whole schedule changed and not get a schedule you requested and have no work/family balance. Your incentives are based on metrics an number of sales not price of sales."
American Express,Vice President,5,Great place to work.  Opportunities for growth.  Excellent benefits.  The performance management process is a little cut throat (forced curve) but as long as you are a hard worker you will be fine.
American Express,Customer Care Assistant,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?the people younwork wirh, but very stressful job due to the cuetomerWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?having rude and  bad customer What is the work environment and culture like at the company?very good, friendly and you will get more supportWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?stressful , almost everyday you will encounter customer who is rude and disrespectful"
American Express,Director,4,Phenomenal place to work and start and build your career. Total compensation packages significantly trail the industry across all band levels and needs to be overhauled. 
American Express,Credit Specialist,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Professial but fun atmosphere where employees are respected and given opportunities to excel. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not much, even challenges were welcome. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Friendly and supportive in a clean professional atmosphere. What is a typical day like for you at the company?One role was in customer service, another in collections so you are essentially on the phone for eight hours. In another role, Client Development, you weren't attached to the phone as much."
American Express,Chef,5,great place to learn and grow. Customer service and creativity are a major part of worth. Being a chef a work life balance in any workplace is rare and that's something you'll have to be patient with.
American Express,Customer Care Professional,5,"The work of your dreams.Except for work itself. Training and benefits are incredible.Although the treatment is very good, the effort that people make to appear."
American Express,Travel Agent,1,"The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to the people while arranging their trips for them, and being able to learn about the different places that they have gone and seen, and so I can refer to that to other people. I have had quite a few great supervisors that I worked under, but American Express doesn’t know how to hire managers that have good managerial experience. They just hire within any department so that most of the time you’re getting somebody that is so new that they totally screw up your job and your performance, and make you look bad to the company for the sake of their own good"
American Express,Sales Representative,5,Easy job with great benefits love the way you can grow and become part of a team that cares.  Would recommended 100 percent.                          
Honeywell,Director IT - Cloud and Infrastructure Dev/Ops,4,"Honeywell was a solid stop on my career journey.  I worked in a number of IT individual contributor and management roles, and had plenty of opportunity for advancement.   Pay was generally consistent with the market as long as performance was good.   Consistent pressure on cost cutting resulted in weaker IT senior leadership as time progressed.  Frequent reorganizations and a CIO carousel also resulted in a lot of job instability and churn.  The organization seems to be reverting back to a more restrictive management style with respect to remote work and location restrictions."
Honeywell,Security Technician,4,"Honeywell is an excellent workplace for those passionate about technology, engineering, and innovation. The company provides many learning opportunities and is well-suited for individuals who enjoy working in a global, fast-paced environment. However, the demanding nature of some roles and the corporate structure may not appeal to everyone. If you value career development, working on impactful projects, and a collaborative international environment, Honeywell can be a great fit."
Honeywell,Senior Analyst,4,"Had a chance to learn and grow. Overall, My experiences here have been largely positive, and I look forward to contributing to its future successes..."
Honeywell,Process Engineer,5,Good work-life balance. Treated well by everyone and management was good while I was there. Relaxed but productive work environment. Hardest part of the job was when production lines would have issues - this is typical in continuous production facilities. Best part was that I was always treated with respect and trusted to do my job well - by everyone.
Honeywell,image processing engineer,4,Offer virtual platform for self learning. Flexible hours.research and development projects.There are interesting challenges related to learn new technologies.

Honeywell,Operator ,5,Honeywell has updated their pay to compete with area plants. Everyone is trying their best to learn the system and keeping the plant operating in a safe way! 
Honeywell,CNC Machinst,4,Supportive team to help you learn new positions the building is very hot with long working hours. Makes it exhausting work. You’re not allowed to sit down during your workday except for a break and lunch. The floors are concrete on the legs and feet.
Honeywell,Test Technician,4,"Good place to work. Management can be unreliable at times and lack of communication might aggravate most. Also, be prepared to be asked last minute to work overtime a good percentage of the time."
Honeywell,Regional Sales Manager,4,"Immense proud to be associated with HoneywellGreat products and king in Industrial productsGreat Social recognitionManagement is overall goodSome managers are not greatPerformance oriented culture- always on toes with work pressureGood compensationIf you are at Head Office where leaders sit, then will get promoted very fastTough bosses, but lot to learn from them to manage business, stress etc."
Honeywell,Consultant,3,Not a fun place to work.  Cost reduction to priority of management. Not a lot of focus on employee growth. Difficult to transition to other roles that can take full advantage of an Employee's talents. 
Honeywell,Process Operator,2,"Honeywell Geismar…Working here can be very difficult and mentally stressful. You are required to work alot of overtime. The days can be overwhelming with the amount of physical work, lockouts and permits. Working in an acid suit is a must for alot of the work you do because of how dangerous this place is. The process is pretty difficult and takes time to learn, but this place can make you a great plant operator with the amount of lockouts, permits, work under pressure, and complexity of the unit. You can succeed anywhere if you can succeed here. It’s important to make a good first impression here or you will become an outcast quickly by most of the operators. If you don’t fit in, you won’t fit in. Management does absolutely nothing to protect employees. They let go of the good workers for making a mistake and keep the ones they like around. Micromanagement is unbelievable here and the you always feel nervous to do your job because one mistake will get you terminated. People start here but don’t stay here. The turn over rate is off the charts and for good reason. The only good thing is the pay rates. But the insurance is a joke and retirement is a joke. Working here is not fun. "
Honeywell,Sr. Mechanical Engineer,4,The company has very consistant work with a lot of freedom to move around within it. There are a lot of oppertunities for expereince but you have to make them. Promoting up within the company can be challeneging if brought in at a higher level. 
Honeywell,"Sr Manager, Legal Operations",4,"Honeywell FM&T is a great place to work. The mission we support is exciting and motivating, and for me, ia the best part of working here. Leadership cares about the workforce, and invests in each of us. As a Sr Mangager I am empowered to make decisions, provided ample opportunities to learn new skills, mature those I have, and pursue formal training in areas of focus related to my job responsibilities. "
Honeywell,Category Manager,1,"The worst company I worked for. 0 training, everyone is confused, stressed and overloaded.  Management is just as stressed, scared and confused.  Benefits suck."
Honeywell,High School Intern,4,I enjoyed working at Honeywell as a high school intern. There was a lot of things to do and the work environment is very welcoming. Would definitely work here again as a university intern sometime in the future

Honeywell,Machinist,4,not bad not bad good management good people only bad part they dont pay goodi wish they will pay more but not but they will help u  improve and learn 
Honeywell,Timekeeping Intern,4,"The pay is decent for a practitioner, the work is hybridly so it is comfortable, you work 6 hours a day and you have time for your school.The only thing I would add would be the option to be more flexible with the workload, especially when you start."
Honeywell,AASP/ Electronic Assembler,4,What is the best part of working at the company?The laid back environment.  The goal is centered around quality not quantity. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The drive to work was the most difficult.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Excellent environment to work in compared to other places I've worked.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I'd leave in the same condition I came in.

Honeywell,Assembler,3,"I worked there during the pandemic. Very fast paced. You were pretty disposable, high turnover rate. There was mandatory 6 day work weeks. High pressure to make certain numbers. I. One process you had to go from training was 10 seconds a rotation to about 4.5 seconds in about a week. Lots of repetitive motion not great if have carpal tunnel or any kind of tendonitis.  Do not recommend. "
Honeywell,engineering,1,"Honeywell declared a long time ago that Mississauga location would be closed in the foreseeable future. There is no advancement and minimal career development for Canadians. It is extremely difficult to get a position at HQ (Phoenix, AZ) as most of the programs belong to DoD and they would not accept you without US citizen/PR. "

Honeywell,"Sr. Manager, Engineering",2,Always asked to do more with less.  Not worth the stress you go through for industry below average pay.   Benefits also  continue to decline.  I don’t recommend working here.
Honeywell,Project Engineer,1,"A typical day in my role as a Project Engineer was spending at least half of my day or more in recurring meetings (some of which could have been an email). The other half of my day was spent managing more projects than any one person should have been assigned. I was responsible for ensuring forecasts were accurate for all projects every month, making sure contractors met their commitment and kept the projects on schedule among other typical project engineering tasks. This proved to be extremely difficult especially during covid. Management didn't want to hear excuses either. We (PEs) were expected to push vendors and basically threaten them to deliver a finished product or else we had to face reprimand from management for not meeting targets. The workplace culture was not a welcoming one at all. Everyone was stressed out to the max and no one at my site was helpful at all. There really was a depressing feeling in the atmosphere when I worked there as if no one was happy to be at work. I really did not like my management team: my immediate manager and my skip-level manager.  We seemed to but heads on even the smallest of issues. At that time the cocid protocol was a joke. You had to have been fully vaccinated in order to maintain employment at Honeywell. This was not fair to a lot of people who for whatever reason did not want to get the vaccine. Forcing people to choose between getting a vaccine you didn't want in your body or maintaining employment was not a good business practice and not fair at all. Honeywell was basically a revolving door with all of the turnover. It's no - more..."
Honeywell,Sr. ISC Project Management Specialist,3,I received little to no support during a rotational program I was in meant for graduate level employees. I am being forced out of the company once my rotation is complete with no support for new rotation besides finding a new position internal to the company on my own in a supply chain role.
Honeywell,Quality Control Inspector,5,I love working for Honeywell. The benefits are pretty mediocre however the hourly rate offsets that. I enjoy being able to come in to work and problem solve every day and work with people across different functions throughout the plant. 
Honeywell,Customer Service Representative,2,"You're just a cog in the machine. Long days, no clear direction of what you're doing. Little pay,  bad covid protocol. The list could go on and on.  Not a great place ."
Honeywell,Software Engineer,1,"A Typical Day at Work:My typical day at Honeywell as a software engineering intern involved long hours of coding, attending meetings, and working on various projects assigned by my supervisor. The workload was often heavy, and I frequently found myself working beyond standard office hours to meet deadlines. What I Believe I Learned:During my internship, I gained practical experience in software development and honed my technical skills. I learned how to navigate complex codebases, collaborate with a team, and manage multiple tasks under pressure. However, the intense workload sometimes left little room for a balanced learning experience.Management:Management at Honeywell was professional but often seemed disconnected from the realities of intern workloads. There was a noticeable gap in understanding the impact of the demanding schedule on work-life balance. While feedback was given, it sometimes felt more procedural rather than genuinely supportive.Workplace Culture:The workplace culture at Honeywell was high-pressure and results-oriented. While there were opportunities to interact with experienced professionals, the emphasis was heavily on productivity and meeting targets. This environment, coupled with a lack of flexibility, contributed to a challenging work-life balance.The Hardest Part of the Job:The hardest part of the job was managing the excessive workload with the given time constraints. The volume of work often made it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance, leading to long hours and significant stress. Additionally, the discrepancy between the - more..."
Honeywell,Engineer,1,"It's difficult to know where to begin with the issues here:1) The company lacks any form of long-term strategy, focusing solely on immediate profits.2) The organization fails to offer competitive salaries and struggles to retain employees. Opportunities for promotion are scarce, and salary increases are nonexistent.3) The workload is overwhelming, especially as more individuals leave the company, further burdening those who remain. Despite this, there are no plans to hire additional staff.4) You will be urged to work overtime, often with clever methods employed to avoid compensating you for it.5) Most tasks are outsourced, resulting in a lack of engineering advancement and minimal opportunities for skill development.6) There are no new products being developed. Instead, you'll find yourself stuck with outdated offerings that undergo repetitive rebranding, often failing due to poor management and incompetence.7) Management is dismissive and treats employees poorly, viewing them as expendable resources.The one silver lining remains the camaraderie among lower-level staff, who, unfortunately, feel trapped in their situation and work solely to support their families."

Honeywell,Bpx,1,Your manager does not care about anything. They will just drop you off and expect you to learn from others that complain about training you. You succeeding is very little. Management is all a bunch of liars and all about favoritism. They look for ways to fire you when it didn’t even happen! Stay away! Bad place to work! 
Honeywell,Operations,1,"Days filled with stress, threats from management. Contracts don't matter, jobs are not secure and they let you know often that you are just a number. "

Honeywell,Senior Customer Experience,5,"The company is good, offers services that no company does, there is a good work environment and it offers you what is necessary to do good work.There are positions that perhaps would not be necessary to go to office every week, which a full HO would be ideal since it is far away and most employees get up between 4 and 5am to get to work."
Honeywell,Engineer,4,"Projects/work can be fun but internally funded projects are easily cut when business is bad, then the work culture takes a nose dive.Internal development and career paths are not great unless you have a diverse enough background to jump across the veritically organized business units/functions which means leaving the company might be a good fit.Pay/benfits average.

Honeywell,Material Handler,3,"Monday - Friday sometimes Saturday 2:30pm-11pm in regular days with no overtime but with overtime we stay until 1am sometimes until 2am. Most of the 2nd shift departments are understaffed and are under a lot of stress because of management. Its a good short term job, personally I learned that most of the actual employees are super nice, it's just the supervisors that are a pain. They want us to do more than we can even do or handle tho we're under staffed because of them firing or not hiring temps in a timely manner. They expects us to do like a 12 person job even tho theirs only like 5 under that department. Theirs people that have been in this job for more than 2 years and their still temps, it dosent even feel like their even trying to help us to get hired. And some supervisors just make unnecessary changes that negatively changes the work place for the employees and they don't even realize it.  That's why most of the employees are leaving right now it's either the supervisors not doing their job correctly and missing up the workplace for others or they learn about the super long wait to be a permanent employee, when they hire new employees they promise 3-5months until hiring them but most of us  have more than 1 year waiting and some 2 years. Honestly the most enjoyable part of this job is the people you get to work with and that's pretty much it temps don't get any benefits until hired "

Try to get to your emails to see the latest problems. Go meet the team, get blamed or chewed out over some email from a person who has nothing to do with your division, get coffee, try not to throw up from the bathroom smell, try to fix problems in SAP, try to send enough emails to stop the yelling until tomorrow. Go get lunch, get ambushed by somebody’s nepotism hire on steroids at your desk because they want to flirt or talk or demand. Try to catch up on work when they leave you alone.

Honeywell,Senior Software Developer in Test,3,"Working at Honeywell definitely has good perks, but there are way too many issues that prevent me from going over three stars. ProsCompany provided snacks and lunch free of chargeHybrid workPretty good starting payUnlimited PTO - some don't like it, but I like the piece of mind to not have PTO balance anxiety. ConsOpen office layout gets very loud and creates too many distractions that interfere with my concentration  bLack of needed resources to do your job.  The company has convoluted and overly complicated processes needed to be followed in order to get what you need to do your job. Too much time is wasted waiting on people and filling out all the needless forms. No cooperation between teams.  Many times requests for assistance get ignored and require multiple escalations.  Again, can take months to get the assistance needed. Health insurance is the worst I've ever had in my entire career.  It's a High deductible plan and on top of that there is no separate prescription drug plan. So you'll full price for medications until the deductible is met, and even then you'll pay 20% of the cost until out of pocket is met. The lack of a copay drug plan makes medications very expensive.  They did improve it this year by making some maintenance medications free, but it's only a select few that qualify.  It's even worse if you have dependents because deductibles and out of pocket max doubles even if you want to conver just one non spouse dependant such as a child. Lack of meaningful merit increases. No matter how well you perform you are limited to an average of a 2.5% - more..."
Honeywell,Journeyman Plumber,1,"Management is of poor quality and the work place environment is toxic. I would not recommend.  Payroll and time card errors are to be expected.  Expect harassment by patients, Staff, Contractors, and by Honeywell employees. "
Honeywell,Senior Advanced Software Engineer,2,"Good for technically aspiring people but there is no job security, they do silent layoofs frequently. No work life balance, no perks, no good health insurance, no entertainment like outings "
Honeywell,Project Engineer,4,"Relaxed place tp work and ideal for young families, salary is okayish and could be better but overall peace of mind in terms of job security, learning and career growth assessment is at your own pace and also guided by manager."
Honeywell,Fixed assets Accountant,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Flexible and good working environment What is the most stressful part about working at the company?As of now I have not come across such stressful part.
Honeywell,Director IT - Cloud and Infrastructure Dev/Ops,4,"Honeywell was a solid stop on my career journey.  I worked in a number of IT individual contributor and management roles, and had plenty of opportunity for advancement.   Pay was generally consistent with the market as long as performance was good.   Consistent pressure on cost cutting resulted in weaker IT senior leadership as time progressed.  Frequent reorganizations and a CIO carousel also resulted in a lot of job instability and churn.  The organization seems to be reverting back to a more restrictive management style with respect to remote work and location restrictions."
Honeywell,CSR - Customer Service Representative,4,"Ok company, high call volume center and a bit unorganized but that was due to it being a pilot program. Typical environment with its share of busy bodies "
Honeywell,operador de produccion,4,"They have good benefits, the savings is competent but the personnel who work there is very double face, good job that could improve if the staff were not so exhausting to treat, to go up the favoritismos, however, if you are able to adapt youThe work will be simple and truthful reward in your salary"
Honeywell,Contractor,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?None disconnected environment , fake management. Text message to set up for on line interview noFollow up. It is completely misrepresented  of Honeywell What is the most stressful part about working at the company?No respect toContract employees and treated like none existing  classWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Not much to talk about it. No one is working hard to enhance theImage of Honeywell. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Typical 6-2:30 working hours with not much excitement. Just being there for the pay check"
Honeywell,Senior Project Manager - P3,5,Nice company to work for.site based position with flexibilitylong term projects that gives enough learning experience and skills . nice team to work with
Honeywell,Sales Manager,5,"Honeywell provides a dynamic work environment with strong leadership and ample growth opportunities. Competitive compensation, a focus on innovation, and a supportive culture make it an excellent place to work. Balancing work and personal life is encouraged and well-supported."
Honeywell,Assembler,1,Mandatory overtime on days off.  Seniority rules and new hires get the more difficult positions. Working harder won’t get you rewarded or payed better. 
Honeywell,Facilities Engineer,2,"Overall the company has potential if you manage to get in the right click or are male. There were female leaders, but few managed to stay long. Corporate leaders are more interested in other silos of business. "
Honeywell,Consultant,4,"high performance culture, strongly matrix organisation, team culture is not easy to maintain but overall people are pleasant. a lot depends on the manager - development/ growth opportunities, visibility, progression."
Honeywell,Sr. Field Service Technician,4,"Good place to learn and grow your career. Jobs can be remote or stationary, going from mechanical technician to plc/engineer. Only thing I would change are pay raises."
Honeywell,Field Service Engineer II,3,What is the best part of working at the company?A multitude of management & benefit resources available to self starters.  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Having a poor or unqualified manager.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The company is so large that it is possible to have threads of very poor middle level management determining your future. That poor management then is likely to act defensively and in self interest.What is a typical day like for you at the company?When I was enabled to do my job: training.
Honeywell,Production Worker,3,i like working here people are good. you can move up in the company if you take your time and pay attention. i like the group of people im with. there is some drama but thats expected
Honeywell,Customer Support Manager,2,"There were just endless cuts to all kinds of support functions.  Customers despise us, because we never live up to our promises.  Corporate does anything to make numbers for the quarter."
Honeywell,Material Handler,5,The company itself is great to work for. Voluntary OT is there and the benefits are pretty good. My supervisor was cool but my coworkers were pretty toxic to work with and treated it like high school. Great place to work if you’re not dealing with immature toxic coworkers 
Honeywell,Planner,4,All GoodThey give work life balanceGood colloguesGood BossProvide Career GrowthReview on the our feedback on what improvement can be done in every department
Honeywell,Inspektor RT Level 2,5,"What is the best for work in society? The certainty of regular income.5 weeks of holiday is the most stressful to work in society? Constant audits, but that belongs to this job"
Honeywell,Field Service Technician,4,"okay place to work. Subpar wage.Middle Management is bad. If you are not white and speak perfect English, promotion is very hard to get.Really low salary for new grads."
Honeywell,Sales Manager,4,a lot of pressure for sales as upper management don't understand anything and is totally disconnected from what's happending in the market.The rest is pretty well.
Honeywell,Controllership,4,Stable company with a variety of opportunities throughout. All employees are encouraged to constantly move around the company to develop their skillset.
Honeywell,Truck Driver,4,What is the best part of working at the company?Good signing bonus and great pay ! But it’s a great company to work for but no communication from management and dispatchers for the truck drivers sometimes but overall it’s a good company to work for What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Wearing a hazmat suit and respirator! PPE it gets hot inside the PPe suit What is the work environment and culture like at the company?A great environment and all cultures work there What is a typical day like for you at the company?I’m a truck driver and I get my load and hit the road as a team driver and we deliver to our costumer and head back
Honeywell,Assembly Line Production Worker,1,"I hired on at Honeywell in Dec of 2023. We were supposed to have 2 weeks training, we got 4 days! 7 of us were in training,  by Wednesday,  4 were left. We had a 75 yr old man that kept disturbing the class, he actually passed out in class.Then, that Friday,  we were thrown to the wolves on the floor. The training is horrible,  the co workers don't want to train. It is chaos at best. Honeywell is very dated inside,  grey, depressing, actually ugly. Like something out of the 40s. While training,  you have to hunt up the parts you need for your build,  they can be on anyone of 20 lines, and in any case on the line. After 3 days of stress, I  took a good look around. No girls. I also believe it was then my lead who was absent for all of this, returned, and suddenly, I was let go. No reason,  nothing.  Other then being  a girl."
Northrop Grumman,Production Planner/Scheduler,5,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."
Northrop Grumman,Systems Engineer,3,Commercial programs lack the budget the cleared projects have which led to burnt out engineers. A lot of engineers left our program because they were burnt out. Ive heard on the cleared projects it is much more laid back.
Northrop Grumman,Quality Engineer,5,Amazing people and teams. Always room for growth. Fun place to work with professionalism. Many interesting tasks and learn from them as well as learning from your peers.
Northrop Grumman,Manufacturing Technician,1,Plz be careful. Company does not care about you at all. Management even worse. But for short time work it will be great for you. Wouldn’t recommend staying longer than a year. Get treated like you are nothing with this company 
Northrop Grumman,Janitor,5,"Being a janitor is an essential yet often overlooked job that plays a critical role in maintaining cleanliness and safety in various environments, such as schools, hospitals, offices, and public spaces. Janitors are responsible for cleaning floors, bathrooms, and windows, disposing of trash, and ensuring that the building remains in good condition. The work can be physically demanding, requiring long hours and attention to detail, but it’s also rewarding in its own way. A well-kept space not only improves health and hygiene but also boosts morale for those who use the facilities. Janitors are often the unsung heroes who keep everything running smoothly behind the scenes. While the job may not always receive the recognition it deserves, the impact of their work is undeniable, making them an integral part of any community or organization."
Northrop Grumman,Subcontract Specialist,5,"There is a lot of activity on campus with exciting work. The footprint in Melbourne is about 5000 people with hopefully more to come. Due to the nature of the work there aren’t many remote opportunities, though there are some hybrid and flexible working schedules depending on your role/team/management. "
Northrop Grumman,Nobody,2,"Too much to do every day. I learned that NG does not care about hard working people, just college grads. Managements hands are tied due to weak leaders at the top. Culture, where?  Hardest part of the job is watching unworthy individuals take up space. Where's the disciplinary action? Where's the write up? Enjoy my immediate management group. "
Northrop Grumman,Principal Technical Services Project Management,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?NG worked 9/80s. So it was nice to have every other Friday off. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The lack of standardization of truly following PrOP and lack of true training. They'd give you work and it's just expected you figure it out.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Woke. They lack morals and ethics.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Nothing was really ""typical"" - you just kinda do whatever is tossed over the fence to you."
Northrop Grumman,Cable and Harness Technician,5,Great place to work and willing to change things in order to achieve quality/safety and efficiency standards. Several process improvement programs were in place including Lean and 5S. In Addition to that our site was VPP Star certified .
Northrop Grumman,Project Manager,3,good place to work. had fun with employees and a good work environment. management was fair and they train their employees very very well. Good benefits. 
Northrop Grumman,Sr. Principal Cost Estimating Analyst,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Ability to move within the companyWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Timelines and schedule constraints
Northrop Grumman,Contracts Analyst,4,Northrop Grumman is a well established aerospace company. You get pretty much exactly what you expect working at a large company. There are great benefits and as long as you are apart of a solid team there won’t be too many complaints. There are a lot of politics involved in management and it can be hard to advance in your career here if you don’t know the right people.
Northrop Grumman,Associate Business Analyst,4,It is hard to advance and all depends on your manager. Always praises exposure but hard to get any real opportunities as an entry level individual. Good place for the resume booster but not a long term place for a beginner
Northrop Grumman,Composite tech,1,Management is unbelievably bad and employee appreciation is abysmal if any is showed at all. Management is full of people who know each other so major biases and side-choosing which makes getting help from hr impossible
Northrop Grumman,Mechanical Engineer,5,"Seniors Engineers will give you guidance if you ask, since the job is fast pace everyone is on the move. They don't micromanage, everyone is an expert in there field. "
Northrop Grumman,Systems Engineering Architect,5,NG is a great place to work.  Their pay and benefits are excellent and fair.  The company has real ethics in what it does and I admire that.  If you can get on with them then do it.  Make a career out of it.
Northrop Grumman,Engineering Intern,4,As an intern I learned a lot. A lot of the work is very dull and I was kind of stuck doing the same thing without much else. Overall there are a lot of good opportunities if you join the right team.
Northrop Grumman,Quality Manager,4,Very good defense company to work for.Leaders are looking for continuous methods and strategies to improve the overall employee and operational experience to satisfy the deliverables and to maintain employee retention.
Northrop Grumman,Engineer,4,Pros: Apparently improved over the past 5-10 years. Great people at coalface. Pay reasonable with yearly raise. Sideways moves/secondments. Training/development possible if you chase it down yourself.Cons: Bonuses meager. Individual experience dependent on manager.  Prehistoric systems/processes. HR difficult at best. Management a revolving door (usual defence contractor stuff).
Northrop Grumman,Engineer,4,Good place to work good benefits good 401k good pension good employment good location good travel good salary good hours good vacation good holidays! 
Northrop Grumman,Senior System Administrator,1,"Worst most toxic environment I ever work at in IT, 3 people hired for VMware and quit,I was promised being hired at 6 months,not. Hybridwas promised, not."
Northrop Grumman,Production Planner/Scheduler,5,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."
Northrop Grumman,Process Engineer,4,Good place to work but not so good leadership. Hard to change traditional way of working and difficult to bring in and implement new ideas. Good work and life balance. 
Northrop Grumman,Tool Crib Attendant,2,"This job will really wear you down and you will not be appreciated what so ever for the work you do. Site management only cares about one thing, building airplanes. Everything else is secondary. "
Northrop Grumman,Mechanical Engineer,3,I really enjoy the work that I’m doing. The problem is that there are 50 layers of red tape that you need to wade though to get to the enjoyable work. 
Northrop Grumman,Quality Engineer,5,"Very flexible and lots of learning experience. There is no specific time to work, you just need to meet 80 hours for 2 weeks period. They offer tuition reimbursement for 10k per year."
Northrop Grumman,Electrical Engineering Manager,4,"I’ve been with NG for a long time and I’ve always had exceptional leadership until recently. Space is struggling as big as well so perhaps that it compounding with the poor leadership in place. There are still good leaders out there you just have to find them and they will be your greatest advocates. My tip to young people is to make sure you are enjoying what you do and when you are not, start looking. NG is big enough that you can probably find something you like within but if you gotta leave for a bit, so be it. Come back in 2 years and your time will be bridged. "
Northrop Grumman,Parts Coordinator,3,Was pretty consistent as far as getting 40 hours. Overtime was nonexistent unless you were a tradesman. Management was the good old boy system. Had to know somebody or be related to move up. 
Northrop Grumman,Electrical Engineer,3,"A little slow with lots of politics as you get higher up, but ultimately not too bad. Tendency to end up crammed in a niche where you work on your ""one little thing"" and lack a lot of variety. Generally, the people were nice."
Northrop Grumman,Electrical Engineer,2,It's a good place to start off when you're young but there are a lot of problems at this location. Low morale due to people being upset at the NG buyout (this location used to be SAT then Orbital ATK). They've made it clear we're all just a number. Bonuses are dismal- 3 digits. Our cubicles were shrunk to half the size. Many events and benefits from free lunches to free donuts or even holiday parties have all been slashed. Location went from having a family feeling to a soulless corporate feeling.
Northrop Grumman,HVAC Service Technician,5,Good pay and benefits. Amazing work life balance. Very little stress involved. In the day to day. Management is pretty good. This company is doing great things. 
Northrop Grumman,Principal Employee Communications Rep.,2,"NG pays really well but their upper management could care less about work life balance. I was part of the Communications team for about four or five months before I quit. They are forcing people back in the office to sit in lonely cubicles while attending Zoom meetings. Their managers have no empathy. One of the communications manager they hired there was a micromanager, the director never stepped and HR was garbage. Also, the vps take everything personal. If you disagree or wrong them in any way, that’s it, no growth opportunities, no friendly chatter, no help. Just sink or swim. Such a terrible culture. Will be going back to a competitor. If you want a place to thrive where popularity contests abound, this is the place for you. Oh and don’t you dare negotiate salary, they take that personal too. "
Northrop Grumman,Technician,2,Good place to start out but dont stay there for long.  the training is bad they dont seem to care for their employees needs or personal life. you can expect to work  a lot of over time the is  the only way to make money. give up days off so you can please them.
Northrop Grumman,Pathways Engineer Software ,5,Great place to start as entry level. Very welcoming and great space to learn as much as possible. Many opportunities to move into new positions and meet new people. 
Northrop Grumman,Heavy Vehicle Driver,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The schedule of 4 10's Monday thru Thursday. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not knowing what your doing each day.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Woke culture and alot of elitism and people in management who don't care about there drivers. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Load a plane, move some tools, move some pallets, maybe a small box or two."
Northrop Grumman,Engineer,4,Pay is decent. Immediate management is good and will listen to your thoughts and opinions. Work can go from exciting to boring quickly. Overall happy.
Northrop Grumman,Level 2 Quality Assurance,2,"they didn't really try to keep me from leaving which tells me they aren't really concerned with employee retention. very limited opportunities, pay is not as competitive as it used to be, not many positions to be considered for - mostly ghost listings. Luckily, I quit the company with my 401k before the mass exodus to pursue other aerospace opportunities out of state. My brothers ended up quitting too and went on to other aerospace companies nearby that paid more."
Northrop Grumman,Dimension control technician,5,"Room to grow, support groups are the place to be. Followed by good pay and benefits. Flexible work hours. Lots of overtime. Work life balance. Culture needs help in production"
Northrop Grumman,Program Manager,4,Overall a strong company with a large talent pool. Experiences will vary between sectors and business units but the resources and benefits of a large firm are an advantage. 
Northrop Grumman,Sr principal finance analyst,4,"Everything depends on your team and workload!  I’m on a great team who help on another if things get overwhelming. Currently hybrid, but talks are happening to be back in the office full time. "
Northrop Grumman,Engineer ,5,I love the in office collaboration. The Space Park location is chuck full of talented engineers. My only complaint would be that of health care. Compared to other companies they could offer way lower premiums for HMO(s).
Northrop Grumman,Principal Software Quality Engineer,5,Culture is what you make it.  Most just do their job and leave.  Management was professional and supportive. Not a lot of growth opportunity in your position. Must leave your job to grow
Northrop Grumman,Production Planner/Scheduler,5,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."
Northrop Grumman,Sr principal IT ANalyst,2,Very hard to advance without a lot of socialization and networking. Movements are a lot who you know and not how well you do. Layoffs are happening more and more as they struggle to be competitive in their major markets.
Northrop Grumman,Cyber Software Engineer,2,"Lots of staff turnover in the Cincinnati office, leading to ineffective management.  Those left are often asked to do heroic efforts to  cover for management's failure to plan, staff, and lead effectively."
Northrop Grumman,Manager,4,Best company I have worked for wish they would have won the contract again. Good benefits and pto. Decent work environment on the salary side. Would work for them again if they came back and won next time. 
Northrop Grumman,Financial Analyst,4,The job was very easy and laid back. My manager was hands off. 9/80 work schedule which made it easy to have a mental health day every other week. Workplace culture was too focused with work so there was little to no opportunity to team build.
Northrop Grumman,Design Engineer,3,Work depends entirely on team and needs of project. Many options at the company but very little transparency from management and a lot of frustration without hope of things improving. 
Northrop Grumman,Procurement Specialist,4,NG has a broad network of very interesting projects you can work on. It’s a great company to grow your network and provides fairly competitive pay with amazing work/life balance. 
Northrop Grumman,Circuit Design Engineer,4,"I learned a lot working here and always had good interaction with my functional manager and program managers. I had a chance to work on a variety of interesting projects and got good hand-on experience with relevant industry software and tools. One main compliant is that all the engineers with experience have huge workloads to support you as a newer engineer. It seems like everyone is too busy to look past their own tasks even if they do want to help. The PTO is good, other benefits meh and virtually no benefits if you want to pursue higher education."
Northrop Grumman,Manufacturing Technician,3,"Fun job. Low morale. No accountability. The program teams are great. Great place to learn aerospace. Leadership and management are ineffective. In general, for promotions, management bends rules for some, and everyone else is out of luck. It’s easier to change positions if you meet the requirements (again, for some). "
Northrop Grumman,Cost Estimating Analyst,5,It’s a defense contractor. You work on some very interesting projects but since it’s for the govt it’s a lot of red tape so not necessary super fast paced. 
Northrop Grumman,Project Manager,4,Very nice workplace. Lots of support provided throughout friendly atmosphere many different people to work with interesting projects that can be worked on in a hybrid work environment.
Northrop Grumman,Aeronautical Engineer,3,The job was fairly challenging. The first few years at the company is a big adjustment and practically learning a new language. New advancements have helped to make this process easier but there are other setbacks with pushing forward new technology that doesn’t help the everyday employee.
Northrop Grumman,Quality Assurance Inspector,5,I feel this is unnecessary and pointless. Everyone will have a different experience and different opinion. I like my job that is literally all you need to know about.  
Northrop Grumman,Software Engineer,2,"The company hired me too quickly, ran out of work for me, then refused to train me. They put me into a position I was not trained for, refused to train me, then blamed me and threatened to terminate me because I was not qualified for the role. How this is a Fortune 200 company, I'll never know."
Northrop Grumman,Electrical Engineer,4,Best company with work life balance. It is a good company if you want to have free time and long weekends. Very slow paced. You need to look for work because most of the time there won’t be much to do. 
Northrop Grumman,Pricing & Estimating Intern,4,Pretty good experience for a first full-time internship position. Recruiters and intern managers are easy to talk to. The work you get is largely dependent on what manager you get assigned under
Northrop Grumman,Security Officer,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Shameful how the treat people here. Stay away. HR is a joke…never underestimate how low people will go or how far a company will go to cover up a known fraud What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Poor incompetent management , It would appear that Northrop does not do enough to check the background of some other managers and the competency of the managers at past companies   In some places it would appear that Northrop Grumman becomes a dumping ground for incompetent, inept people.    A lot of it is just good old boy and girls network… If you have your act together, know how to work, ethics, values and integrity, stay away from here go look up Other defense contractors like Raytheon, or Lockheed MartinWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic, dishonest, mismanaged and corrupt"
Northrop Grumman,Principal Engineer,3,Too many managers.  Toxic DEI culture.  Lazy workers covered by management.  Talented people fleeing like fugitives.  Only relies on top 5% of the motivated people to do all the work.
Northrop Grumman,Engineer,1,"The Tampa office is terrible. Management is toxic, plays favorites, and bullies you. Turnover is super high and people leave every week. This place is not safe, please do not apply here."
Northrop Grumman,Packaging Engineer,3,They push to better yourself and school but once you do you can’t even find another position without knowing the manager or people close with the hiring managers. Every application gets denied it’s a very buddy buddy company if you want to move up or even around.
Northrop Grumman,Systems Engineer,3,Nothing out of the ordinary for a large defense prime. Benefits and pay are average. Work is less interesting than a smaller company where innovation would be encouraged. 
Northrop Grumman,Production Planner/Scheduler,5,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."
Northrop Grumman,Systems Engineer,3,"Basically they just hire people to fill slots regardless of skill level, salaries are lower than most competitors and every year the training budget is decrease."
Northrop Grumman,Manufacturing Technician,3,What is the best part of working at the company?Working 4 10 hours shifts per week. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?No one knows what they are doing including management. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Maintains a temperature of 72 year round. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Sitting and waiting on parts for 6 hours out of ten to do your job.
Northrop Grumman,Structure Mechanic,4,"It's a fun and challenging job at Northrop Grumman, and most of the supervisor has started as a Mechanic so there more understanding and willing to help, "
Northrop Grumman,Project Control Analyst,3,There is a lot going on here and not the most training. However the culture is relatable in the sense that there is a very helpful unit. Not bad place overall.
Northrop Grumman,Aircraft Mechanic III,4,"Multiple managers with little to no training for their positions. That have no accountability for their decisions and actions are all focused to get their statements of work done, even if it causes more issues, damage, or impacts the overall progress in the long run. This is to show gain on the Gant chart instead actually learning the statement of work, so they can justify the need to slip the schedule and make decisions instead of just reacting out of panic and the need to show progress even when it is in the wrong direction. "
Northrop Grumman,Scheduling Analyst,3,"If you want to make NG a long-term career, you can. If you are able to navigate office politics, the fake corporate game and relationships, or if you are able to just keep doing what you're doing, that's fine too. There are multiple paths to be successful at NG, just like at any Fortune 500. At this company, even with HR policies against nepotism and favoritism, they both reign supreme. Overall, the experience has been favorable even though I often find myself under bad managers - and the company NEVER fires bad managers; they just promote them."
Northrop Grumman,Program Cost Control Analyst,5,The jobs are pretty routine and repetitive due to the nature of driving month end closures. Once the systems are learned it’s not difficult.Management is a good blend of caring about their team members.Most difficult was over coming the bias held against new employees coming in with a  higher salary pay  due to more experiences than the younger team members.Best part was mentoring employees and seeing their smiles when knowledge is shared with them.
Northrop Grumman,Staff Manufacturing Engineering Analyst,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?If you have the drive and ability to learn new things, there is  ample opportunity to excel at Northrop Grumman. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Implementing new manufacturing, material, and document control processes.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Dynamic and collaborative based on current delivery schedules.What is a typical day like for you at the company?The day varies based on what issue is relative at that time."
Northrop Grumman,Principal Mechanical Engineer,4,"Productive, and exciting work. Respectful atmosphere in general. Good work life balance, decent compensation - could be better. My functional manager is great. "
Northrop Grumman,Field Service Technician III,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Pay its like all major companies, smoke and mirrorsWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working for those who are worried about their next promotionWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Don't know was a remote workerWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Awesome remote work is the best way to go"
Northrop Grumman,Marketing Manager,5,Very good experience. Management was amazing to work with and the growth was limitless. It was a great learning opportunity as well where you can earn university credit.
Northrop Grumman,Aeronautical Engineer,3,"- Starting salary is not bad but meaningful raises and promotions are few and far between.- The annual review/merit system is deeply flawed.- Getting things done can be difficult with how much bureaucracy there is.-  Bonuses are a joke.- It's a huge place so the business is not nimble and it's difficult to stand out.- The people are good, and the work is interesting "
Northrop Grumman,Systems Engineer,4,Benefits are ok. Pay could be better while living in a high cost of living area. Bonuses are low compared to other companies in the area. Raises are low compared to inflation.
Northrop Grumman,Human Factors Engineer,5,"If you’re looking for a job for Life, you found it. In the world of tech, you have innovators you have companies playing catch-up and then you have the companies behind the curve. Then you have Northrup Grumman sit back relax and enjoy your tax at work."
Northrop Grumman,Engineering Section Sr. Manager,5,"Best company I've ever worked at. Managers are required to support individuals to find the best fit roles for them. They hold the philosophy that they invested a lot to bring you in, let's make sure you're successful."
Northrop Grumman,Admin Support,5,Nice place to work!Learned many new skills working for this manufacturing plant. Northrop Grumman provided excellent training and education. Safety was the #1 priority of the employees.
Northrop Grumman,Principal Engineer,4,"I worked in production support. Could be a bit tedious on the same project long term, but I enjoyed the stability and work-life balance.There were options to move to more direct program support (involving integration and launching rockets), but those came with more overtime expectations and that's not something I wanted.I was very happy with my coworkers, for the most part. managers had technical background and could assist with developing paths forward. There were a few unskilled coworkers who got shuffled around to different groups. Some did well in other groups others continued to confound people in their new roles.The Chandler location recently announced a mass layoff. I don't know what that will do to the workload or working environment. I was not pleased with the transparency about how they chose who would be laid off.Friends who don't have a Bachelor's Degree speak well of the pay and benefits, but not of advancement. Several of the most skilled people I work with have the job title ""technician"" because their years of experience doesn't let them become ""engineer"" without at least a BS."
Northrop Grumman,SW Engineer,4,Good experience and good people if you are in the right team. Good place to work for beginner and I love how flexible it is. Recommend for new graduate 
Northrop Grumman,Aeronautical Engineer,2,"People i worked with on day to day basis were friendly and supportive. I was told I could work from home by upper management under special circumstances for a specified time period.

Northrop Grumman,"Huntsville, AL",4,"Management is normally pretty great but HR makes everything unnecessarily difficult. It didn’t use to be like that but they put someone in that position that apparently hates people and giving recognition and credit where it’s due. BM has a lot of visibility and they’re normally well cared for, but engineers are out of site and out of mind. They’re more concerned about filling a seat with a warm body than having real talent. It used to be a really competitive environment but not so much anymore. But if you are real talent and have the right people in your network, you might find it worthwhile for the long run. A few teams I’ve encountered have managed to fill every position with either incredibly unprofessional and impossible to work with people, or people who are completely useless. Bad coworkers tend to fail upward because NG won’t fire anyone, the easiest way to remove a bad apple is to promote them to some other position on a different team and make it someone else’s problem. Even if they get physically aggressive with coworkers or the customer. Essentially, someone has to have live footage and a hundred documented cases of bad behavior before they’ll even consider looking into it. An HR report feels more like detention in middle school. Normally doesn’t teach the person anything, and isn’t a big deal. Some teams have fantastic people and most everyone works well together and some management is very good with communication. Others, the managers are complete opposites and basically don’t exist unless you’re really special. Communication and accountability is something that - more..."
Northrop Grumman,Production Planner/Scheduler,5,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."
Northrop Grumman,Quality Supervisor,4,"Working here can help grow your career, and provides opportunities that are unique.  Workload is not often level or consistent, but the company doesn't layoff in slow times."
Northrop Grumman,ESL Instructor,5,Northrop Grumman is a fair and enthusiastic working environment that will challenge and reward you. I highly recommend this employer and thoroughly enjoyed my time.
Northrop Grumman,Sr. Principal Engineer,2,"Raises are capped around 3% and seem to be disconnected from employee goals, leading to dissatisfaction and lack of motivation. Career advancement appears more influenced by luck and nepotism rather than competence, creating a demotivating environment. Efforts to appreciate employees feel robotic and insincere, making staff feel undervalued. The bonus structure is uncompetitive, and despite claims of innovation, operations are outdated. Training is minimal, leading to high turnover and a lack of knowledge continuity. Low raises force people to leave, resulting in reactive, chaotic work conditions. Upper management is self-serving, with many managers lacking true leadership or vision. Overall, there is little incentive to work hard, as employees feel underpaid and unappreciated."
Northrop Grumman,Software Engineer,2,"The pace is way too slow for most people, especially if you aren't joining the company straight out of the military. The work moves slow yet leads/management will still act like everything is urgent, often encouraging overtime."
Northrop Grumman,Structural Engineer,2,The company right now is not doing that great. Despite of this NG tries its best to keep you implied if you are a competent worker - although it may not be a good fit role-wise

Northrop Grumman,Payroll Manager,1,What is the best part of working at the company?My manager was a good mentor and she wanted me to be successful.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?My team that I managed.. I managed 6 and only 3  I enjoyed working with. The others were very disrespectful. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Leadership cared about the success of their employees. The benefits were good. Leadership invested in leducation of their employees by offering free courses. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Every day was very busy. Sometimes I felt like there was no work-life balance because the expectation was to work everyday if needed.
Northrop Grumman,Staff Cyber Intelligence Analyst,3,What is the best part of working at the company?Compensation was fair. Management goodWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Minimal warning of impending layoff. Exactly one pay-period from notice to final off boarding
Northrop Grumman,Contract Administrator,3,"Excellent variety of opportunity for career development.  I've had 4 managers and they've all been terrible  - inappropriate, rude, emotionally disturbed, arrogant, clueless and/or having a complete lack of self-awareness.  Pay is likely better than many other companies, but you're better off having no degree and running a machine than working in GSC or Business Management because they'll work you to death and give you a $200 bonus instead of a decent pay increase.  NG needs to give up the ranking system and their method of mid- and year end review.  In general, the employees are great people to work with.  The best thing that NG has to offer besides career development is their 9/80 work schedule."
Northrop Grumman,Test Engineer,1,"Not good place to work, care about your workers. Poor morale and work environment.

Northrop Grumman,Principal Logistics Engineer,3,I have worked for NG for nearly 8 years and have enjoyed my career.  I have many great coworkers and find the work engaging and challenging.  Like any oversized corporation some of the promotions and outside hires for management are completely mind boggling and effectively ruin teams.I am sure this is not limited to NG but is often the nature of corporations that are this large.  Apparently buttering up resumes and being a good interviewer matters far more than actual performance and internal recommendations when it some to promotions and management hires.
Northrop Grumman,Quality Engineer,4,"Everything about NG is cushy. You can easily just float on by here and collect a check if you want. If you have more drive you can attempt to move up the ranks but there is absolutely no rhyme or reason for promotion. Work life balance is excellent, but pay is below average"
Northrop Grumman,Software Engineer,3,"Layoffs all year round. Forced RTO as well. Not sure about stability.Tech stack is dated, could be team dependent. Good work life balance, but limited personal growth."
Northrop Grumman,Structures Mechanic,1,"If you plan to work at northrop grumman be prepared to be let down on every level. Work life balance doesn't exist, management is poor, be prepared to only be treated as a number and not a person. Pay is subpar, you will need a second job to make bills. You can get better benefits working at McDonald's. For this being such ""high end"" company they treat their employees as nothing more than fodder. If I could give 0 stars I would working any other job is a better decision"

I always feel supportive and that my voice countsWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Meetings throughout the day to meet with the client, or have project meetings"
Oracle,Senior Consultant,5,Great company with supportive staff and an opportunity to grow and stretch your limits. Promotions have a fixed metric which provides a direction to employees.

Oracle,Deal Specialist,2,"Management has some good ones and some bad ones, mostly male lower management that tries to sleep with employees, talk sports and ogle. Lots of turnover, no raises, good staff are abused with heavy workloads and lack of support, advancement or raises, so they leave.

Oracle,Principal Software Engineer,3,"The role provided an excellent opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies and large-scale systems. I was involved in managing the entire life-cycle of sophisticated physical buildings using web technologies, which included working with BIM, shared-space VR, and related technologies such as BCF and OpenCDE.One of the highlights was implementing CI/CD pipelines using Docker, Kubernetes, and native mobile APIs, which significantly improved our development and deployment processes. I also had the chance to optimize data packet processing between microservices on AWS and OCI, resulting in a 35% improvement in system response time and a 20% reduction in cloud computing costs.The collaborative environment at Oracle allowed for continuous learning and growth. Working with internal teams and other companies provided valuable insights into different aspects of software engineering and architecture. The experience honed my skills in REST APIs, web development, distributed systems, and system architecture.However, like any large corporation, there were occasional challenges with bureaucracy and decision-making processes. Despite this, the overall experience was positive, offering numerous opportunities for professional development and the satisfaction of working on impactful projects."

Oracle,Sales Development Representative,3,"Great place to start sales after college. They do paid  training for 8 weeks on sales and product knowledge, and you get to build a huge and strong network of professionals who recently graduated college... feels very much like college/family vibe during training.The downside is that the sales work is very much grunt work e.g. 250 calls and emails per week and you're also responsible for researching the company, building a blueprint on their current state, researching who to call and tracking down their contact info for 10 different accounts at a time while logging them correctly so management can give credit for your work and you can end up working long hours of unpaid overtime. medical benefits are good but there's basically no PTO in the first year (they give 6 days but make you take it while their offices are closed for Christmas)if you're a hustler who loves sales and wants to make a name for yourself in corporate America, this could be for you. If you're trying to get paid and maybe meet some people, maybe develop your resume... I'd consider looking elsewhere!"

But when she left, my career took a nose dive and I was continuously put on less strategic projects, moved to different teams, and eventually left because there was no recovering. I saw unfit people getting promoted while I was doing more and more menial tasks.  When I started, I would describe the culture as to the point, fast paced, brusque.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The environment culture are decent as long as you drink the company, Kool-Aid and join the cult… oh and also if you ignore the companies positions regarding global affairs, especially related to Palestine.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Meetings on meetings on meetings on meetings no time to even get your work done unless you work over eight hours"
Oracle,Support Specialist,2,"Management often blamed you for things that you had nothing to do with. They would also make false claims to get you in trouble. No raise, very hard to move up. "
Oracle,Senior Technical Support Engineer,2,On my team the vision from the top of management wasn’t seen by those below. Inexperienced managers were put into place leaving a very uneven workload between teams. 
Oracle,Senior Software Engineer,5,"Wonderful team, colleagues with good work life balance. You can make friends for life here.Work wise it is good. But has scope for improvement. Salary is good but less hike . But has good job security. "

Oracle,Tech support,5,"Handle customer technical issues on the phone and via support application.  Research and resolves issues based on symptoms and files.  Gets a bit tedious, but great job if you have patience and focus."
Oracle,Business Development Representative,4,"Great learning opportunity, but is very much a go getter place to be, not a lot of support or direction offered if you are struggling. Management is okay, remember here you are just a number and very replaceable."
Oracle,Ingénieur Support Technique,3,"Good wages.Possibilities of evolution, but also dependent on the general management in the USA which manages ""far"" with the problems that we imagine"
Oracle,Software Engineer,4,"Work-life balance is good, unless you’re oncall. If you actually know how to engineer software then your skills will be recognized; you’ll be given good projects then. Promotions are hard to come by. Orgs are forced to rate performance on a curve, so a backlog of promotions forms. Sometimes the curve has only 1% of worthy engineers get a promotion. "
Oracle,Account Director,3,"Ok place to work, a lot of internal competition between different LoB.Hard to get promotions.Good work/life balanceNot the best reputation in the IT market"
Oracle,Principal Content Strategist (CX Product Line),1,"* The employee culture is sadly an outcome of the “Destructive Leadership” management style.* I learned to walk away from an unsafe employer.* Honesty is like an extinct animal there.* If you are a ""Go Along to Get Along"" person, you will stay for years."

Oracle,Expert Service Associate,5,The company is good overall. Good management and good for freshers. It’s a growing environment and seniors are helping. Loved working here. I started as a fresher and it was a good experience.
Oracle,Member Technical Staff,4,"Good people, a good environment to work in.Work-life balance is good but depends on the project as well. Benefits are stocks, leaves, and flexibility.Overall a decent company to work in."

Projects are a team effort and you have a big team to help you.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lay offs are seemingly always around the corner. Also while upper management says ""our employees as our most important asset"" the truth is their stock options are much more important to them. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?ThermoFisher likes to hire young people cheaply. The culture is friendly and collegial. Being a large company they have deep pockets and deep resources. You will get the resource you need to do your jibe, but you might get laid off at the drop of a hat.What is a typical day like for you at the company?meetings from morning to night."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Associate Scientist,4,"Decent place to start out after college. There is a  lack of promotions for people who are deserving, yet they continuously hire people at the lowest levels instead of promoting they people they have. Sudden lay offs. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Associate Scientist ,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The best part of the company is the word we get up a form because you’re working in the lab getting hands-on experience. And the coworkers that you get to work with our great.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The most stressful is when there are whole bunch of essays that need to be performed, but there’s not a lot of staff and the manager or pi . doesn’t voice the fact that there’s not enough time to complete everything and especially you to complete while being underpaid What is the work environment and culture like at the company?it can be catty and not great at times.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Check emails check the essays you need to perform then go actually perform those essays for 4 to 8 hours. Take a break. Go perform more then go home."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Logistics Coordinator,3,"My team has a great manager who does their best to support us and protect us from higher corporate drama, but it's clear this company takes on more projects than it had capacity for, and instead of increasing that capacity, it increases pressure on its current employees. Pay is less than what we do is worth."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Scientist III,4,Very positive culture with flexible schedules. People are nice and supportive. Good place to start and build skills. Pay is very average though! Promotions are also slow! 
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Inspector/Packer,2,"Standard parts packing factory type work that is fast paced. Overall, the place is pretty disorganized and chaotic. Pay and time off is ok, but the insurance is expensive. "

Thermo Fisher Scientific,Laborant,5,Very friendly and pleasant employer.Good salary and very friendly employees. It is very difficult to get a job.The requirement for experience is high
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Software Engineer,3,"It is a good company in terms of benefits, they are good unlike other companies, but it depends on which team it touches you is how your day will be, it may have a team where everything becomes beautiful, with time, and others withA lot of urgency. If you want to go up, it is very complicated, you have to justify everything and even if you are very good, if there is someone competing for the same position that you and it falls better to some boss or is recommended from someone, you may not be able to competeFor him, although they make you believe that yes, if you are an antisocial person (like most in this race) it may not go very well here"
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Associate Research Scientist,2,"Thermo Fisher is a very difficult place to work with poor recognition and an obsession with useless ""corporate initiatives"" used in place of proper compensation.  The morale in my current division is very low.  They tend to hire lots of entry level personnel and not enough mid career staff to support their development.  There has been an enduring culture of high turnover in the last 3 years and absolutely nothing useful has been done to combat it.   Promotions are consistently behind the curve.  Expect to be passed up multiple times for promotions or to not even know what the next step for promotion even entails.  This is a corporate problem.  Supervisors do a good job advocating for promotions, but management and HR will do everything in their power to deny a promotion.   Job descriptions are inaccurate.  You will likely not be doing the tasks you expect.  Initial training and orientation is pretty good, but expect the ""Wild West"" after new employee training.   This is a very large company so experiences vary wildly between departments, but my experience and the experience of my direct coworkers seems to be pretty consistently negative."

Thermo Fisher Scientific,Treasury Analyst I,1,The department I worked you had to figure things out yourself with minimal help. The department was micro managed and let ran by a fellow employee instead of management.  Expectations were unreachable and underpaid for the amount of work.
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Scientist,4,Learn as entry level . Not good for experience person growth is limited. Pay is low as Contract manufacturer. Also politics make growth limit. Partiality  can be seen in growth
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Commercial,5,Company where life is good despite external constraints as government constraints is a company with a very beautiful image with professionals
Thermo Fisher Scientific,HR Manager,4,The organisation is demanding and ofter unrealistic expectations are set with delivery timelines. Can be stressful to work here. In general the people are nice to work with.
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Project Manager,3,"Leaders at each site of the company play a critical and wide-reaching role in maintaining a culture and WorkLife balance. Work team are groups of colleagues who are part of and/or support the goals of a diverse population and offer development opportunities, mentoring and networking for skill-building and career advancement.

Thermo Fisher Scientific,Técnico Logístico,5,"What is the best part of working in the company? In addition to the benefits, the staff of the operation, I have no words to thank you for all learning I had there.

Extremely great, work culture can improve but still great. How is a typical day for you in the company? A typical day, were the Thursdaysfairs where we had the day to organize the operation."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Quality Control Scientist I,3,"Super corporate environment. You're just a cog in the machine. Lots of reviews structure, and rules. My department was run well so the day to day wasn't as bad. However, after the pandemic our entire division was laid off and the location shuttered. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Sr. Program Manager,3,Loved my time at TFS. The teams were fantastic to work with and you can tell that we’re all working toward a common goal and not just paycheck. However it didn’t seem like the management hired was always forth coming with their intent which lead to a fairly busy rumor mill that wasn’t usually wrong. 
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Administrative Service Coordinator,2,"You will succeed  only if you butter up your supervisor or managers the compensation is very low for the tons of work, mid- and annual reviews are not fair if you  are disagree with your supervisor you are  the next  in the laid off list  there are not  standard operation procedures  practices you have to create one and  there are no physical presence of HR representative  the salary increased is the same for everyone doesn’t matter if you work in office or production and goes from 10 cents until 50 cent  if you are lucky"
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Process technician,2,"Awful place to work, I felt like just a number ready to punch out, was told it was like a family but more like a conveyor belt of people coming through one door and straight out the other while they treat you like lamb to the slaughter house, just saying how they treat humans."

Thermo Fisher Scientific,Procurement Specialist II,3,High stress environment.  10-hour workdays with after-hour requirements.  Little to no training for new employees.  Management and workplace culture did not foster a team atmosphere or cross department coordination. Very little home/workplace balance.  
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Processing Technician,2,Poor management and wages. Some really great co-workers. No support from management and hr staff. If you are a yes person you should do well here. Usually lots of overtime 
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Production Worker,3,"Was a great place to work for and sometimes, hate it got shut down and moved to another place. The workers and company were always hard workers and friendly "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Material Planner II,3,"Pay and benefits are good for the industry.  Coworkers are nice and work life balanace is great (drop your kid off/ pick up, appointments). Lack of communication from management is a consistent problem though and causes customer problems that come back onto the customer facing employees."

The company will recognize your work and give you the tools and support to succeed in furthering your career. Pay is low, benefit package is nice. They offer days, afternoons, nights and weekend shifts which is a nice variety based on your personal needs. "

Thermo Fisher Scientific,Warehouse Worker,1,This is a toxic workplace and this place by far takes the trophy for High Turnover.  Management is horrible and talks  behind everyone’s back.  Raises are based on buddy system. The employee morale is horrible and very toxic no team work. There has been a high turnover with Supervisors as well. This facility and its leadership is like the Grinch! All the positive reviews are Not in this location unfortunately.The CEO needs to invest in the company Leadership at the Suwanee Facility. 
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Warehouse Assistant Manager,4,What is the best part of working at the company?The company a very comfortable  working environment mostly due the great people I had a chance to work with.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?They never really had any areas of the job that caused much stress but if I had to choose one it would be making sure the customers received their orders on time. We were dealing with hospitals and labs so we needed to ensure that they received their orders on time.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Throughout the local warehouse and the head office in Ottawa everybody that I dealt with was very easy to work with. Kind of like being part of a familyWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Everyday would differ for shipping and receiving and stocking and inventory counts. The manager and I would meet in the morning and set up the usual day as planned and if there was anything special that needed to be done we would find a  place to fit it in.
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Manufacturing Technician II,3,"Company doesn’t care about you anymore, lazy people skate on by while the hard workers get used and never promoted. Pay was decent and got a lot of pay raises during Covid but that all stopped. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Supply Chain Coordinator,3,Good to acquire experience. Salaries are low vs. the work being put in. Limited development opportunities. The company can be more process-oriented and open to change.
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Senior Manufacturing Technician,4,"Good place to get experience, people are friendly. Can get stuck with progression long term. At times it could feel nothing was being done to improve conditions on certain departments"
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Packaging Group Lead,1,What is the best part of working at the company?I worked with some great hard working positive thinking people who always put the patient first.

Thermo Fisher Scientific,Assistant Scientist,2,They expect more from you without any promotions. Only want to see growth in number no matter how many employees are left to work lol. They also lied about how promotions are handled after 1 year of hiring. Can’t be trusted at all! 
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Customer Service Representative,5,"The atmosphere is 10, good companions who always help, learn a lot, and wonderful chiefs ... The other teams also generate that feeling of calm, that we are not alone"
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Lead,3,"Unfortunately a lot of people have left this site due to extreme favoritism.  Some of the leadership team are best friends and have all worked together at a previous employer. You cannot comfortably say anything to one without the other’s knowing, making it a toxic and suffocating environment for anyone does not fit in. Not what I expected with such a large company that promotes values such as ethics. There is nothing ethical at all about this situation. We have lost some irreplaceable employees as of late due to this reason. "

Thermo Fisher Scientific,Software Engineer Intern,5,Work environment and colleagues were friendly. As a intern the work was not so stressful and able to learn variety of skills. Supervisor and colleagues offered alot of guidance
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Sr. Project Manager,3,I was so motivated to work at TF; very disappointing experiencedishonest culture declarationssorry that I chose TF over another job offer that I had for a smaller medical device company
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Warhouse Associate,3,They take advantage of people and show no appreciation of their coworkers supervisor and mangled very disrespectful. They pull you fromYour Jo. Duties to help another department alwhixg shouldnt be doing since you don’t work for that department then wonder all backed up. Expect you to be 20 places at once when you’re still the fastest hardest worker in building. They don’t care about anyone or your health. Just some of of people that worked there are clueless and wonder how they even got a driver license I wonder everyday that they must be ashamed of how they work. But they actually think they doing work when they just have no common sndse. Some of workers are okay and friendly. But some are two faced and like to talk about others and complained juts to get attention.  Broke my back out for that company. Jo one comes even close to be as the hardest worker that I was when worked there. Glad I quit cause they ruin my mental health
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Operator II,3,"Thermofisher Scientific is a great place to get your foot in the door if you’re interested in biotechnology and manufacturing. The pay is pretty decent in my opinion and the job itself is easy, but can be pretty physically demanding at times. HOWEVER; if you’re looking to be here for the long haul, I feel like there are better companies that would be better. Promotions are far and few and they prefer to hire externally rather than internally. While I was there they had us do mandatory overtime, which can be extremely exhausting. Overall, this company is good for building experience and learning about biotechnology and manufacturing, but they lack opportunities for growth and advancement for capable people."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Engineer/Scientist,4,Workday is very intensive. It’s challenging job. I learned ICP instrumentation and corporative rules . Workplace culture is ok. The most enjoyable is chemical testing for me. But it should be more training scheduled..
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Data Analyst III,4,"They have huge caps on the promotions they give, so you're almost better off being hired from the outside. But there is a really nice job security and good opportunities to be promoted from within."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,R&D Engineer,4,Good climate combined with a good quality of people that really help you from the first time you step in the company and quickly adapt yo company and becomeproductive
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Clean Room Technician,1,"Tons of training,  tests have to be done daily ,so you have to come in early 1 hour several times a week to read and take tests . Cleanroom gowns and gloves are a pain to put on and off each time you go inand out , even for restroom break, micro managed . Constant talking among co workers distract you, people work too close together. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Raw Material Handler,5,Working hard to get things done and accomplishing things. Made a lot of good friends and had a good support system in case you needed it since our department was small.
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Marketing Manager,2,"Prior to and during the pandemic, the company experienced strong growth. Bonuses were frequent and the overall organization felt great to be playing a major role in the fight against COVID 19. The number of employees also expanded during this period. In the past few years, as the company has struggled massive downsizing has taken place and there's a ""Hunger Games"" type culture where it's everyone for themselves and self promotion for advancement instead of doing what's best for customers."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Operatore,1,"General escape escape, a scarce and manipulator management, to avoid, a Welcome Week, great, then when you enter the ward, the whole opposite, everyone works as they want, fake accesses in the sterile area, granny, mobbing, and rude garments,Little prepared, these then represent the company ... ahahahahahahahahahaha"
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Product Specialist,3,"package is okay, colleagues and environment good. Lots of training resources. stress in poor market as target is higher and higher. a good place to start your career. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Lead Data Analyst,4,I like the place and worked for 15 years. It changed many administrations but the core team is quite stable. I will keep working in this place for many years. 
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Picker/Packer/Shipper,3,What is the best part of working at the company?Most of your coworkers are willing to help you with different task. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Getting used to the different rotating shift start times.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work environment is cool but you should keep you personal life separate from the job.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Constantly on the move trying to get the product out.
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Supervisor,4,"Typical day is resolving order delays, working on manufacutring efficiency and finding ways to increase cost savings. Management is reactive and constantly changes the goals that manufacturing needs to achieve. Hardest part of the job is the culture. Recent management changes have created 2 different cultures among the technicians and this has created different leadership styles and schisms between shifts."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,"Ciudad de México, CDMX",5,Very good in general is a good company
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Material Handler,2,It’s dirty. Theres no Air Conditioning and they won’t open the doors in the summertime.  It’s freezing cold in the wintertime with very few heaters. I hated that job 
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Associate Scientist I,3,"Pay ranges seem on the lower spectrum compared to other bio companies and receiving a promotion seems rare, but I enjoyed the people who worked with me there and didn’t really have much trouble. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,VP Finance,4,Intense corporate culture with high expectations. Good mission and mostly talented colleagues. Overly bureaucratic with multiple layers of questions and directives - sometimes centered on wants instead of reality.  
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Lab Technician,2,Would say that working here is good for fresh graduates/ people starting out in the industry. The best part would be meeting some of the people you work with. Do not really learn anything from the higher ups. Project management basically forces you to do their job for them.
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Scientist,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?The best part of working at ThermoFisher is your colleagues are very supportive. Projects are a team effort and you have a big team to help you.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lay offs are seemingly always around the corner.

Thermo Fisher Scientific,Supply Chain Analyst,4,The job is very well throughout and productive overall.  I would highly recommend to anyone in need of a job or trying to obtain one right out of college. 
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Account Manager,4,"Depending on which part of the company you are working, it might be stressful. But there is a lot of opportunities within the company.  As I said in the caption if you like science, you will enjoy the work. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Client Services Project Manager,4,While the job itself was rewarding management had no clue of the actual job itself and what was involved. They didn't know how to grow this particular business segment and focused on profits instead of people. They kept adding responsibilities to the job but didn't provide adequate training or time. Management was constantly focused on ensuring revenue was coming in.
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Conducteur de ligne,3,Good pharmaceutical company overall. No increase in salary therefore to negotiate well from the start.A lot of RTT and various rest.HORIRES in 3x8 but a lot of random change ...
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Assistant comptable,4,"Very good atmosphere, top teams and inter and intra service relationships are also very good.Good corporate culture, flexibility and listening. CDI salaries are quite low in accounting and finance.Some managers are great, others leave something to be desired.Little or no prospects for evolution."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,AP Team Lead for North America,4,"Dynamic and interesting work, you learn every day, you have the feeling that the work done helps to improve the world. On the other hand, many processes are not clear, or defined and much less documented.The best practices of industry and staff management are not applied by some managers is very subjective.Gisele Fernández is the worst that can happen to one."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Accountant,5,"It’s a good place to work,  but it can also be really busy. Overall I’d say it’s a great place to work because there are a lot of opportunities (it’s a big company) and the pay and benefits are competitive. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Research Lab Technician,2,"The work is fine, but the workplace culture is terrible. Heavy micromanagement and passive aggression from management. Any nonwork-related socializing between techs gets shutdown by management, which destroys morale. No amount of pay could compensate for working in this kind of environment. I would only ever use this position to get the skills and experience needed to move on elsewhere. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Lab Specialist II,3,"Good training, support and work life balance. Horrible at promoting within, despite their push to focus on career paths- what a joke. We've lost many long term employees. The cycle seems to repeat every few years"
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Staff Accountant,5,"I would go to work and process invoices, Payment disbursement, and cash receipts. Management was supportive and honest.  Staff was enjoyable, and supportive."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Operatore packaging,1,"Avoid entering the package, infinite dead times, grannies, people who are sitting and compete with those who work less. The current Caporeparto evaluates based on sympathy and if you are a pimp go ahead.You're nodes are nice to the boss, the supervisors are washing their hands, one of these has the wife who works in the package and always favors her to stay beautiful comfortable seats, to her and her colleagues. Ambiente at all stimulating, not at all dynamic, at all,It looks like a geriatric department from how many over 60 they are present."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Manufacturing Technician II,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The best part were my coworkers and the rotating shifts.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Having horrible management. No one to talk to when needed. Open door policy they claim they have is a lie. They will retaliate against you for speaking up against a higher ups.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful! 95% of your coworkers don’t do their jobs. They disappear for hours upon end, nowhere to be found. All while you work hard all shift long. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Come in get your assignments. Go to your respective stations."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Operator 2,1,"Management is horrible, supervision isn't great. The more work you do the less you are rewarded.  Communication is horrible . Most people are miserable so makes work life miserable also. Very hard to advice your career . It's a good Ole boys club mentality.  They truly do not care about their workers . They care about money and that is the only thing that matters . Use to be a great company . And upper management they come and go all the time so there is no consistency. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,scientist,1,"Everybody is looking for a way out. From analyst to managers. They promote a negative environment where you’re expected to work and be micromanaged to pieces, but not be paid for any OT that may happen as a result of upper managements’ incompetencies and blindness to what are acceptable expectations from an entry level job. Look elsewhere with better salaries. They know they can pay less and they constantly remind us that. Know your worth and find a job that gives you a clear route of promotions. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Molding Team Leader,5,"I had a great experience at Thermofisher Scientific plant in Auburn,Al.I had a host of great supportive managers, supervisors,team leaders and colleagues.The work was smooth like butter and the pay was great."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Repacker,3,The communication between management and the floor employees is basically nonexistent. Management makes decisions that the floor team knows won't work and won't listen when concerns are voiced. Difficult to move up and low pay raises.
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Lab Technician,3,Nice friendly folks to work with but turnover was problematic. Some veteran employees have said standards have gone down in recent years under different leadership. Not good. 
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Patient Advisory Services,2,"Teams are great to work with but upper management doesn't listen to what the real problems are, and don't make efforts to fix them. Totally focused on winning more business instead of delivering the work they already have."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Formulation Technician,3,Unorganized and lack of training. No cooperation from management when concerns are made. They treat contractors badly and do not give them the proper tools to succeed.
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Production Line Assistant,5,I started at Thermofisher in assembly in 2020 because I was laid off from another company when Covid shut down happened. Thermo was great but then they laid off hundreds of us in 2023 when it slowed back down. 
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Scientist,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?The best part of working at ThermoFisher is your colleagues are very supportive. Projects are a team effort and you have a big team to help you.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lay offs are seemingly always around the corner. Also while upper management says ""our employees as our most important asset"" the truth is their stock options are much more important to them. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?ThermoFisher likes to hire young people cheaply. The culture is friendly and collegial. Being a large company they have deep pockets and deep resources. You will get the resource you need to do your jibe, but you might get laid off at the drop of a hat.What is a typical day like for you at the company?meetings from morning to night."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Independent Contractor,4,What is the best part of working at the company?Flexibility to complete projects on reasonable timeline.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Tight deadlines are the normal.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is supportive.What is a typical day like for you at the company?The typical day varies depending on the project you are working on.
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Scientist II,5,"Good work life balance, overtime will be paid . Flexible timings and hard work will be rewarded . Great place to get trained on all the analytical instruments "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,"Tewksbury, MA",1,"Revolving door in many departments.  Mgmt, HR and even Corporate ignores concerns/complaints with department procedures as well as unreliable/problematic personnel.  No room for advancement.  "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Assistant Scientist,4,Great for entry level. Used pipettes to perform assays. Made reagents and calibrated instruments. Enjoyed the workplace culture and work life balance 
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Senior Scientist,1,"You get no motivation to work hard as it seems the harder you work and the more you do the less you get.  They will continue to ask more out of you until they break you while employees not doing anything will get the same ""promotions"" as you do."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Digital Marketing,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The company pays really well, and it seems to have an endless budget. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Managers need better training. I was never sure how I was doing in the role. That should be crystal clear. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Way too many meetings. Managers like to feel important and to include unnecessary staff in meetings. What is a typical day like for you at the company?The typical day includes at least one unnecessary meeting."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Senior Engineer,3,In general it is mediocre compared to other companies in the region. Turnover is high. You need to put a lot of effort to stand out and be recognized.
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Technical Support Engineer III,5,"Overall I would like to just say my time spent at TFS was incredible. And during my duration spent there I was able to garner so much knowledge in the nanoprobing semiconductor world. I worked both independently and with my engineer colleagues really well depending on the role needed whether that be a resource or answer. What I learned there was how to manage multiple ongoing assignments. As well as planning and arranging tasks needing attention updates daily/weekly. I understand the practice of many T/S routines to follow whether the problem was arcane to myself or not. The workplace culture was absolutely tremendous when it comes to having integral, dependable, and reliable engineering colleagues. Now when it comes to the most challenging part of the role. It was hosting classes for training sections of the nanoprobing system. Each year it is mandated and imperative each engineer participates at least in 3-4 training classes while having assignments, projects, and deadlines to work with. The part I enjoyed most was the work environment all around. Anytime as an engineer I had any requests with project feedback, or was in need of technician support. The work environment was wonderful and diverse all around. Diverse in a way many had a strong background in many areas. It was never difficult finding a floor resource for system answers in general areas. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Senior Key Account Manager,4,"Thermo Fisher Scientific offers a high-growth environment with access to cutting-edge technologies.  As a Senior Key Account Manager, I've had the opportunity to work with a talented team and build strong client relationships. The workload can be demanding, but the company provides the resources and support needed to succeed. There's a good work-life balance, but career advancement opportunities can sometimes be limited depending on your specific department. Overall, it's a solid company with a strong reputation for a reason, but there's always room for improvement."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Operator I,2,"It’s so chaotic. Very cliquey out there. Management does very little to train you for success. If you are with a temp agency, expect to do all the work while the permanent staff does the bare minimum "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Leadership Team,5,"The team at the Florence, KY, location is very seasoned. Many employees have been with the company for over 20 years, and a large number of them have over 30 years of experience. That’s extremely rare in this day and age. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Inventory Control Specialist,3,"Overall not a bad place to work. Communication with management needs work, always seems like no one is on the same page. Creating unneeded stress across teams."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Project Manager 2,2,"It's a hard job and management either micro-manages negatively or leaves employees to work alone.  The expectations are flawless execution but everything always has an issue.  The managers blame the employees  - there is very little support; when you reach out to managers for advice, transparency, workable solutions in a collaborative manner, the managers say they have spent too much time always having to help... so employees feel isolated and choose not to be open because its detrimental in the manager's perception of your abilities.  The only positive is colleagues outside of my area."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Senior Manufacturing Technician,1,"Really an awful experience. Mass layoffs shortly after starting, favoritism, gossip, the usual high school environment at a factory just times 1,000. Management is the worst I’ve ever seen, they’re insanely fake and lie constantly. Shady company. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Investigator Services Assistant,2,"Most people who work here are either related to or romantically involved with someone else who works here which means personal/relationship/family drama frequently ends up in the workplace. If you're a remote employee, you can generally avoid it but if you're considering any of the in-person or hybrid jobs at this facility be aware. HR is generally ineffective as it's exclusively a digital ticket system and there is RARELY an HR rep in the building. It's less than once a year on average that I've been here and that rep was from corporate. There is no full time, in-person HR staff at this facility. There is a running joke among employees that it's impossible to get fired regardless of how poorly you perform at your job or inappropriately you behave. This is a double-edged sword because it means you have really good job security but if you run into an actual issue with another employee it generally becomes easier to quit and find a new job than for HR or management to actually address it. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,QA Technician,4,"goof shift pattern, potential to grow within the company.Fair management, teams get on well and help each other out.Busy environment. Pay is quite good. "
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Material Handler,1,"The people you work with are the best thing, but the pay is very poor and progression doesn't exist unless you have friends in high places. Doesn't matter about work ethic so might aswell do nothing."
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Gestionnaire relation client,1,"Pretty nice business on paper but fairly low salary, no possibility of evolution"
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Manufacturing Associate,3,"Not enough training curricula, poor management and organization of tasks, great people on the team to work with, affected by layoffs by the end of this year"
Thermo Fisher Scientific,Sr. Electronics Technician,1,What is the best part of working at the company?My piers. The atmosphere and work environment was good.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management overlooked poor performers in favor of friendships and youth. I was let go during my annual review. Exceptional employee but 61 years old. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work environment was great.  The culture was also good.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I arrived at least 30 minutes early every day and worked hard. I followed all of the rules and documentation requirements. All assigned work was either completed or updated in the records system.

"The TJX Companies, Inc.",TJ Maxx Sales Associate,1,"Constantly got bullied and made fun of, horrible pay, feels like high school except everyone is a bully. Managers expect u to be at 100% most of the tomr"
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Grunt worker,1,"You will be sworn and shouted out by other staff members who will then deny this and despite them being the instigator and you walking away from this hostile situation you will be painted as the aggressor. The system of jets required for you to do your job constantly breaks down so you cannot hang the items you are paid to do. When you report this it is often ignored,  and on a day when the system broke down for the majority of the shift (over 6 hours) you will get a member of higher management accusing you of not working as you haven't reported the jet system as being down when you have and the people you are meant to report this to are well aware of this but throw you under the bus to save their own skin. At your station you will either have jets to do the work or work and no jets ,a situation the management are aware of but don't care about apart from when you have not hit your target then it becomes your fault. Get told to do things an alternative way by one member of management then spoke down to by another for doing this as they don't agree with it. Of course,  again it is your fault for following orders. Get told if there are no jets find another station but then get told off for doing this. You really cannot win working here and I can't wait to leave. Their system of clocking in and booking holidays does not work.  I have been here nearly three months and still cannot access my wage slips, book holidays etc and have told IT and my line manager weekly and they are totally uninterested in resolving it."
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Senior Allocation Analyst,4,TJX is a great launchpad into a career of retail. There are lots of opportunities to engage with leadership and it is a rewarding culture to be part of.
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Sales Associate,1,"Management are the most horrible people i have ever came across in my life, they are some of the most rude people, this does not include team leaders as they were pulling their weight across that shop, and they were the most caring and compassionate people ever, however managers in the store are the most vile people and really need to rethink their career choice if they continue to act the way they act. Other employees were also great and so helpful and also really pulled their weight across that shop. ALWAYS short staffed, would get phone calls on my days off at around 3pm asking if i could come in at 4, and got made guilty if i ever said no. Managers are downright bullies, and pick favourites, and if you are not one of them you better not let a finger slip out of place or you get pulled into the office, but even after all this behaviour, don’t dare try to leave because they pull the sympathy card and guilt trip you into staying in the most toxic workplace ever. "
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Retail Associate,5,"I’ve had a wonderful experience working here. The co-workers are friendly and cooperative, creating a positive and collaborative work atmosphere.

"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Retail Sales Associate,5,"Sometimes, days would be slow with very minimal customers and tasks to complete. When the rush came, or on days when it was busier, there would always be a task at hand. This was never overwhelming, it was just the right amount of workload to keep you going while also not burning you out. The best part of the job was having such supportive coworkers and managers.

"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Home Department Manager/Coordinator,3,"Very busy days working there, always plenty to do. I learned how to be super in retail and great in customer service. Not all management is glad for your growth, but those that take pride in your work for real and appreciate your value and commitment, without feeling insecure and want you to go higher or move up then you cherish that talent, instructor/manager totally. Great culture especially during holiday times, wonderful feeling to enjoy the seasons there. Dealing with insecure coworkers is difficult, and trying to make every single customer happy and meet all the challenges and demands can be overwhelming because in retail you have two classes of people, ones that appreciate your value and work, and ones that only want  some type of favor or deal that goes against the policy or code, you MUST learn and know the difference.Thanksgiving and christmas are great there the decorating, the music, themes, great holidays spirit great memories and times......"

They send more merchandise than the store is capable of displaying on the sales floor. This year the company expanded its normal store hours. Stores now close at 9:30 pm everyday, worsening employees’ work-life balance. The company cares more about credit card applications and profits than its employees. "
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Administrative Coordinator (cash office),5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Everything we do is a team effortWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?When we are shorthanded staff ,and we are busy those that are must pick up the slack What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Good work environment and have muliple  different cultures working What is a typical day like for you at the company?I have multiple task I do in any given day"
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Backroom Coordinator,3,Backroom Associate is a fast pace job and will keep you moving your full shift. I've learned there is always something to do! I believe the hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with changes but with communication and notes the job can get done. Workplace culture is awesome. The most enjoyable part of the job is watching the new associates move up or move on to help with career growth. Be a Maxxanista!!!
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Human Resources Assistant,2,"HR department is pretty bad in this building. Management is subpar and causes a large turnover rate. From the perspective of the employees, HR is unhelpful and difficult to talk to."
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Customer Service Associate,3,"Great merchandise, work is well balanced , some friendly associates, Poor Management skills, coordinators and key carrier let the titles go to their heads in using their titles to get away with being a team player. The Management team attempts to hide from the heavy workload. Key carrier is very nasty and always has some kind of attitude in talking down to the associates. Has no respect for others and Management appears to be afraid of Key carrier who thrives on making associates fear her. Negative work environment. I thought it would be different from other retail companies, but they are all the same. Trying to use associates to make the company big money while only giving an annual raise of 40 cents. The 10% discount is just saving you the tax which is just a waist of time. They threaten the associates to sell the TJX rewards credit card and if you don’t they will write you up. Customers are getting nasty and are tire of hearing associates forcing the credit cards down their throats. "
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Buying Administrator,2,"The rest of the company is amazing and supportive; however, this doesn't apply within the buying operations department. The supervisors and managers show no concern for the employees' mental health, and they tend to blame them until they feel unwelcome and decide to leave. Many good people have been forced out this way.  there is no opportunity for progression within buying operations unless you fit in with the clique mentality."
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Marshalls & Homegoods Backroom coordinator,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Was great in the beginning but management can change an experience. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Being compared or talked down on What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Family and drama. A lot of the people you work with you do get close to. Customers were 50/50, I had a lady throw trash at me because I didn’t have a trash can with me at my register. But customer and coworkers differ from location What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful. Waking up at 5am to unload a truck, work 40 hours with no small staff and get told “you don’t put in enough time or energy”. SM wouldn’t let leave me the morning I decided to quit! (Doors locked and just a few other coworkers in back prepping to unload truck)"

Business is booming, And management is willing to work with you on your own schedule. Great environment to learn and grow in. "
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Customer Service Representative,2,"They take advantage of hard wokring employees. Little upward movement. Continue to promote inexperienced associates while overlooking hard workers. On register, they harrass cashiers for credit card applications and will get mad at you for not meeting ridiculous goals. If you do meet your nearly impossible goals they do nothing excpet give you more register shifts, which are extremely sressful and everyone hates. You are basically punished for being good at your job."
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Sales Associate,2,"Bad hours, management is terrible, asked to sell credit cards and punished for not getting sales, badwork environment and disrespectful level of work life balance "

I give customers a number based on how many pieces of clothing they have. I put what they don't want on the return rack."
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Investigator,1,"If you enjoy internal investigations the job itself is very fun, long hours, great pay. However that completely changed when a new manager was brought in. Lack of communication, unprofessional, micromanaged, emotional decision making, and lack of sense of urgency to get task done. The company itself involving the LP department especially in field investigations is very toxic! Finger pointing when things are slow or go wrong, jealous coworkers willing to back stab own team members to make themselves look good, and more importantly complete favoritism especially when it comes to promotion. Upper Lp management have clicks and they don’t even try to hide it. It’s all about who likes you at this company not who works hard and has the experience. Go the NTF (external investigations)  route not CII (internals) to avoid the drama especially in Northern California. "
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",ASSISTANT STORE MANAGER,4,"TJX Companies is a place that celebrates and values its employees, whatever they preach they truly live by. They don't give up easily on people, and offer a myriad of growth opportunities. If you show interest in career growth, they will offer some of the best training I have ever experienced, truly in depth with great supporting materials and of course the support from management. If you grow internally, the team above you grows too, so it's a win-win no matter what, everyone becomes involved in your success. Pay could be a little bit higher, especially as you start to grow your career as more functions are added to one specific job and the pay does not grow proportionally. A job in management at a store location is really fast-paced and can be quite stressful. Corporate seems to be a bit out of touch with what happens on the sales floor based on the type of decisions they make. I would like to see them asking for more feedback from the store managers and ASM's before they make certain decisions."

"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Loss Prevention Detective,1,What is the best part of working at the company?If you a teachers pet then you will fit in perfectly!

"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Merchandiser,4,"No two days ever look the same which is both challenging AND exciting! The thing I enjoy most is the ability for each of us to contribute in our own personal way towards the success of the team and the store.  Your day is determined by what you bring and the energy that you cultivate with the team. The store has a flexible leadership team who are supportive of professional and personal goals. Engaging with people is the most enjoyable part of the day! Our customers love this location and we have many repeats that come in multiple times each week. That speaks for itself regarding culture! The hardest part of the job is often the lack of hrs available but also offers each of us the opportunity to strategize on how best to accomplish the goals received within the budget allowed. Working together to make it happen is what it’s all about! The retail sector has changed dramatically since Covid, and those who are able to grow their business are those that learn to adapt and respond to the changing environment and landscape of brick and mortar doors.  This location has learned to embrace that reality in order to continue to meet with success!"
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Merchandise Controller,5,"The work environment is conducive, and the personnel are amicable. The quality of food is commendable, and overall, the experience is positive. Occasionally, the work may become monotonous, but it is well within acceptable limits."
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Merchandising Associate,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The customers were nice. There is literally nothing positive I can say about the actual company itself. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The location I worked for was the most drama filled, disorganized unprofessional work environment I have ever encountered in my entire retail career of over 23 years. There was so much gossip, mostly between managers about lower level employees, and everyone seemed to have to pick a side. It was ridiculous. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic. Childish. Dramatic. Unsupportive. Chaotic. Rude. Out of touch with reality. What is a typical day like for you at the company?You come in fairly early, which I liked, help unload or unpack the truck, push merchandise wherever you could fit it in the store and then just keep stuffing the shelves all day long. Very little focus on customer care. They believe customers WANT to hunt for things, so we were told to leave them alone. Don’t try to keep an area clean or organized, there is no time for that. Just get everything out on the floor, regardless of how messy and chaotic it looks. Or if it’s even safe. Breaks and lunches feel way too short and but then end of the day you just want to go home. Such a MASSIVE push to make people sign up for credit cards, as in asking three times minimum per transaction. That’s just pushy."
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Corporate Customer Service Specialist,2,"Too big, too corporate, minimal pay for what is considered a no brain position in the corporate office, No autonomy to make your own decisions,  Ten to twelve minute walk from Parking area to where you can clock in!"
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Customer Experience Coordinator,4,"A normal day-to-day at the TJX Company stores is hardly ever the same. Some days are quite hectic while other days are very calm. The staff are generally of all the same mindset, with very few being on the opposing side. Staff members and management typically get along well and are willing to work with one another."
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Retail Merchandiser,4,"Tjx is an awesome company to work for!

"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Cashier/Sales Associate,2,"After Thanksgiving there was a busy time for all employees up to right after Christmas, from January until mid March until I worked there the scheduling went from 6 days a week to 2-3 and before it was 8 hours but it went to 4:45-6h tops. And management kept feeding us with answers that soon the slow time will pass. And the salary was $14 an hour so for me it wasn’t worth it to work 1/2 of my shift for Uber only. "
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Loss Prevention Detective,5,"I like the job as it is low stress and there isnt much required from you depending upon your DLPM. You create your own schedule >ACCORDING TO BUSINESS NEEDS< you cannot schedule yourself 9-5 MF. You get a 45 min break and 2 15s. You do get an office with pretty decent cameras. You get 5 days of PTO after your 90 days and accrue sick time. You do get travel reimbursement (mileage and travel time), some opportunities for overtime, and the pay is decent for someone like a college student or someone who lives at home with parents. You could expect $18 - $22 if you're in a high cost of living area. If you have experience, try to aim for $20 or higher. Lots of room to move up. 40 hrs a week and some managers even let you do 32 since that is considered fulltime at tjx.The negatives are the politics in this job are annoying. Imma just say the policies in which you can make an apprehension are tedious and if you make a mistake you will be chewed out. Also, having a quota is the worst part of the job. The job can get quite mundane as you do have days where you sit in the office all day and do paper work. "
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",General Warehouse Associate,3,I clocked in 5 am but I just couldn't manage to sleep well.Sleep pretty much sucks if I'm being honest. The work is quite easy but yea not an overall bad shift.They do move you alot which I personally didn't like as much. I'm neutral on this shift since I worked 3 days out of the week but arguably the best days. Friday - Sunday. 3/5 for me personally good if you don't care much about your weekends or sleep within those 3 days lol.
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Stocker,3,"I’ll work there for a few days the management yells at the coworkers. It wasn’t a great experience working there, but the coworkers were nice overall, I give it 4 out of 10 "
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Cashier/Sales Associate,3,I was cross trained everywhere besides jewelry. They put me anywhere and everywhere they needed me. I had no issue with the hours I worked. There was a variety of people that worked there and that shopped there. Pay definitely should be more but that opinion comes with most jobs. The up front coordinator had constant mood swings. The manager was sketch but did his job well. Most enjoyable part was clocking out. 
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Home Goods Associate,4,Loved the people I worked with. Pay is good and fair. A lot of work to do especially if you work in the backroom. At times can be stressful and fast paced. All in all it’s a great place to work part time and you meet a lot of great people. 
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Sales Associate,3,"If you are lucky to have a nice, understanding and organized management team, the workplace is very much tolerable. As a sales associate the job is not difficult to learn. May be able to grow from part-time to fulltime to a coordinator and so on. However, training is very poorly done compared with they expect you to know and do. Working in the warehouse is what I enjoyed the most: started early, not too much dealing with customers, seeing all merchandize first. Management will say they will always have your back, but most managers do put clients first, making you look bad and as if what you did was not what they taught you."
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Management Trainee,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?You meet great people and there’s always something new each day to work on What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Having a lack of training and training yourself as well as constantly having management turnover and being under them but expected to train them. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Store associates are great and ASMs are usually amazing, it’s the stores managers that don’t support or help their team that bring everything down"
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Supervisor/Coordinator,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Discount was probably the only reason What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The lack of a cohesive management team What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The culture was sadly disappointing.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stress was from beginning to end

"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Associate,4,"Working at the TK Maxx warehouse was a fulfilling experience filled with opportunities for growth and camaraderie. While the fast-paced environment and physical demands presented challenges, they also fostered a sense of accomplishment and teamwork among colleagues. The management, although not without its flaws, provided support and guidance when needed, contributing to a positive work atmosphere. Overall, it was a rewarding job where I felt valued and appreciated. Given the chance, I would gladly return to work there again, cherishing the memories and relationships formed during my time at the warehouse."
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Shop Assistant,1,"Managers watch you throughout your entire shift. They talk down to you, critize you and make you feel like children. They don't allow for sickness even when you're clearly suffering. They don't allow for progression. The store is busy but other than that the work itself is fine, just a lot of unneeded pressure during a visit."
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Sales Associate,5,Was an okay place to work at as it consisted of what you would expect when working retail. Busy time come and go just depends on the time and day that you’re working 
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Returns Associate,2,"TJMaxx used to be a great place to work at but with so many assistant managers it gets very confusing. They fully push you, almost demanding, to get people to sign up for the store card and if you fail in that, you will be talked to. The issue about the card is, that does affect someone’s credit whether they get approved or denied. With this day and age, people are cautious about their credit. The associates there are great and so friendly but the management needs some serious work. "
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Warehouse Receiver,1,They're not the fun company they tell you they are not fare when it comes to employee accommodations it's horrible to try to change your work area they rather fire you then move you to a different place it's hard to grow in the company unless you come from another state or you're friends or family with someone there in a high position you'll never move up they stress rush you to finish your job so they can get their cash bonuses but the employee never gets the bonuses the offer you on the interview with the excuse of they're waiting for the warehouse to be fully functional they make lots of excuses no to pay for overtime even if it's mandatory when you don't get paid on your pay day ( wich it happens constantly) you have to wait up to 3 weeks for that paycheck you have to deal with a lot of rude disrespectful supervisors but if you defend yourself you will get fired  
"The TJX Companies, Inc.","Nashua, NH",4,"4-8 hour work shifts if you're part time or full time. I learned how to effectively get customers to apply for credit cards and how to navigate difficult situations in the workplace through customer experience. Managers were ok. Workplace culture is a typically positive one. Hardest part was credit card application quotas. Enjoyable part is how flexible they are with your schedule, picking up shifts or switching shifts and requesting time off. "
"The TJX Companies, Inc.",Cashier/Customer Service,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?I love to social with the customers...The store I am at Has lots of Great People and Management that cares..What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Asking about the credit card..times are changing and challenging.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?They care about us as Humans.,If you are looking to excell in your Career..There is plenty of opportunities.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I work part time and it goes pretty fast.."
Johnson Controls,Sales Representative Drove business growth,5,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
Johnson Controls,Customer Service Advisor,1,"The jobs itself isn't bad but the whole atmosphere is being ruined by management who don't have a clue.Jobs are advertised as 4 on 4 off but this could be changing to an awful 6 week rota in near future.Vetting for successful applicants, which is done before you can actually start working, takes months to complete."
Johnson Controls,Line Worker,3,When I worked there it was hot and no one wanted to work so I was doing most of the work on my end by myself but there were cool people that made the job bearable
Johnson Controls,Press Brake Operator,1,"It's hard work with little benefits and decent pay, overall, I would say that the employers care very little for the employees, and everyone is there for themselves, don't expect help from the supervisors or union reps. Your leads won't do much for you either, just keep your head down, do your work, and leave when you get tired of it. "
Johnson Controls,Assistant Manager/Sales Associate,5,"As an Assistant Manager Sales at Johnson Controls-Hitachi, a typical day involved interacting with clients, identifying their HVAC needs, and offering tailored solutions. My role required a deep understanding of both technical specifications and customer requirements, making each day dynamic and challenging. I also worked closely with cross-functional teams, including engineering and marketing, to drive sales and exceed targets.One of the most valuable things I learned was how to manage client relationships effectively while staying attuned to market trends and competition. This role sharpened my sales strategy, negotiation skills, and product knowledge.The management team provided solid guidance, but also gave me the autonomy to develop my own sales approach, which I appreciated. The workplace culture was collaborative and result-oriented, with a strong focus on customer satisfaction.The hardest part of the job was handling high-stakes negotiations while balancing client expectations and company margins. However, this challenge helped me grow significantly in my sales career. The most enjoyable part was closing deals and seeing satisfied customers, knowing that my efforts directly contributed to the company's growth. It was incredibly rewarding to achieve sales targets and receive positive feedback from clients."

Johnson Controls,HVAC Service Apprentice,3,I worked at Johnson as a HVAC apprentice. The culture of the company was very cliquey. The guys that were there knew each other since high school and were not very warm to outsiders I am also a minority and was the only minority in the company at the time not sure if that has anything to do but I digress. Management treated me like a grunt and liked to ride me hard unnecessarily regardless of my job performance because of my apprentice position. I can say I learned a lot and I worked extremely hard to grow and I kissed butt when absolutely necessary but I also didn't eat or take sugar honey iced tea  from anyone and that's partially why I am no longer employed. The culture was very much a you have to prove yourself constantly and need to assimilate to fit in I wasn't really big on that. Ultimately I was laid off due to a safety policy concern. Had I been more favorited like some of the others I would've been able to get past that but I was not liked much and that played a big part of my termination. ( A big part of me not being liked was because I was a full time student pursuing my bachelors degree in biology while working full time. These guys want you to be all about Johnson Controls all day all night and because I had intentions of growing my skill set outside of Hvac they decided to navigate away from me. )

In next 2 years, I do not see AI as technology on the roadmap even though it is mentioned by every single leader. "
Johnson Controls,Tuber,2,"Training process has growing pains, and is unprofessional at best. Management hardly talks shift leads besides complaints, trainers will set up new hires for failure by setting them loose without proper training. Maintenance refuses to do repairs. Hours shift wildly with only a few days heads up. Health benefits are nice though"
Johnson Controls,Assembly Line Worker,1,"* You stand around a lot not enough work to keep you busy.* There is no training * Management has no responsibility to take care of anything you r the one that has to do all of the appointments, set up any appointments.* There is nothing hard about this job."

Johnson Controls,Painter/Laborer,1,Management would do better running a lemonade stand much less an assembly line facility. Management ever listens to you.

I’ve definitely learned a lot and grew while being employed here, my fellow coworkers have been very helpful and supportive in the process. The room for growth & advancement is definitely there if you put in the work and let your supervisor know you’d like to move departments etc. Learn all you can and utilize everything you now know, overall it’s a good place to start. "
Johnson Controls,Control Systems Technician,5,"From day 1 of starting at Johnson Controls, I was met with nothing but positivity, encouragement, and valuable training that helped me to perform the job. Even if you have minimal knowledge of HVAC systems, JCI will help you to keep up with ongoing projects. The staff at my region were absolutely wonderful and I enjoyed speaking with them on a day-to-day basis. The pay is a little low, depending on your experience and career path. But for those who are still in the entry-level, it's a great place to be! My only regret is not staying longer due to conflict in career path. Perhaps my career will align to come back in the future. Who knows? I wouldn't mind it."
Johnson Controls,Order Picker,2,"Was at Source one for clarification, 50+ hours a week, 13 days in a row mandatory overtime in june-september and hear the main plant is worse. Unless you like overtime, avoid at all costs."

Johnson Controls,"Cranberry Township, PA",1,Cranberry Twp/Pittsburgh office. No chance at promotions or advancements. It’s a good ole boys club and clique. If you’re not in the clique or friends with management you can forget about any type of raise or promotion. HR nightmare unfortunately 
Johnson Controls,Production Worker,1,"I do not recommend this place at all, unless they pay well"
Johnson Controls,Engineer,3,"This is a very siloed organization with the domains of Fire, HVAC, Security, and Digital (OpenBlue). Culture varies depending on which organization you're in as well as the team. There is no real career path, just lateral movement."
Johnson Controls,Quality Assurance Technician III           ,4,Depending on what department you work the management can be great or really awful. The compensation can be great or awful.

Johnson Controls,FIRE & SECURITY ALARM SERVICE TECHNICIAN,2,"Typical day was to go to your appointments set up for you.Call in when each service is completed.I learned management isn't on your side ever; the Union is in Mgt's pocket.

Johnson Controls,Route Service Sales Representative,3,"Some of the management it super nice. However, the company really needs to get it together. They are using processes from 2000. Their systems don't talk to each other. People weren't being paid while the Hack was going on. With their pay structure it's hard to count on your weekly check. Pretty Lame. "

Johnson Controls,Engineer,1,"At first, they will provide the things that you need for you to work efficiently. The managers are failing to see through the technical side of the job. You would need to work beyond 8 hours a day and sometimes even on weekends through phone calls, emails and such. Asking for a reasonable manpower scheduling nicely for efficiency would upset the managers and they would end up canceling almost all the benefits that they provided. They will not fire you hence they will make sure staying will be hard for you. Terminating your contract will be a negative to the management since they would need to explain it to the head office why certain positions would always need to be filled. If you want a work life balance, be careful and be thorough with the details of your job responsibilities for this company. "

HP,Software Engineer,1,"It was okay at first, but management changed and the new team were awful micromanagers. It was very chaotic with no clear guidance or priorities. Constant turnover of project owners, we went through four or five in a few years. Our manager doubled as the scrum master and the team had no input into planning or sizing work. Marketing set the deadlines and you'd end up working 60+ hour weeks. As soon as a feature released, the business team would decide it didn't fit their strategy, and we'd have an rush to remove the feature so we could kill ourselves doing the next feature they'd want removed as soon as it was released."
HP,System Administrator,3,Job was fun and pay was competitive. Learned a lot and helped me move up to several promotions.  Management was great and always available to help meet my goals.

HP,Back Order Analyst,3,"After years making active efforts to obtain fair recognitions and development opportunities, I verified that internal culture is hostile against racialized employees.My dismissal was given after seeking protection against a recurring episode of matonism and suggesting protection tactics for racialized employees. If you are a non-white employee I give you these suggestions: Document any questionable interaction with colleagues or supervisors for your personal record,discuss your salary and incentives with trusted colleagues (although internal policies discourage you), and take advantage of free affiliation to LinkedIn Learning (and any other tool).Salaries are not competitive, look at HP INC as a trampoline at better opportunities."
HP,Software Engineer,3,"Company with good culture and fair benefits. Good place to retire but not sure how good it is for younger generation. But when it comes to promotions, there are tons of people queuing in front of you and you will never know when your turn is.  My advice is, focuses only on high profile project. Recognition is not always reflecting your contribution."
HP,Sales,3,"Honestly being an employee at the HP store used to be so much fun once upon a time. The main problem about working for this company is the STORE MANAGERS that seem to think that the title of being a store manager means you're some sort of god!For me personally, working at the HP stores has been a bittersweet experience. I have had great moments in the job and sometimes i wished to pack up and leave immediately not because of work pressure but because of the treatment of management (in store particularly). Which goes against the HP store DNA and culture.Managers in some stores can be very much inconsiderate of other people's feelings, in manners and tones that they use to speak. They are bullies and use manipulation and reverse psychology and make it look like people in lower levels than them are always at fault and in the wrong.They preach teamwork, but when it is time to be a team they always take the backseat and when things go wrong they always put the blame on other people. Rules are bent and broken when suitable to them (Store Manager) but when others do the same, threats are sent and HR will be involved in a blink of an eye.I could go on forever with treatments that we receive from our store manager. Honestly HP would be an awesome place without these types of people because it seems the title of store manager comes with added disrespect directed to staff. Stores would manage just fine because the work they do (when they feel like it) can be done by literally everyone."

HP,Global Competitive Intelligence,1,"Unnecessary drama and lack of professionalism around every corner.  For a tech company, HP is surprisingly stuck in the dark ages for what is provided to accomplish work.

They want a specific amount of work done everyday and complain but won’t help the employees. There are too many bosses and they create a hostile work environment.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Bullied a lot and not respected.  Company is run by a very tight knit group of corrupt individuals.  If you work here, your best bet is to keep your mouth shut and do exactly and only what they tell you to.  Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT trust anyone.  Lots of former convicts working throughout the organization and they try to build your trust to get to know you but then become jealous and fabricate stories to get you on the wrong side of upper management.  Anyone who considers themselves intelligent, a high achiever, or team player, look elsewhere. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very toxic work culture.

Publix,Grocery Stocker,4,The job is pretty easy to do as a grocery clerk. They pay pretty decent and management is okay for the most part. Management can make or break the job
Publix,Cashier/Customer Service,3,Good luck getting a decent amount of hours working part-time. Full-time allows for little to no work-life balance; being overworked can be a problem. Management at my store was questionable to say the least. 
Publix,Cashier,4,"Starting work there was amazing, they basically spoiled me with hours but that eventually fell off. Don't get me wrong, everyone I worked with were so nice and understanding but the management was slacking a bit. You could ask them to do something or check something and they'd completely forget. I was set to get trained to be put at the customer service counter but that never happened. I talked to both of my customer service managers and even the store manager about it! I was never even scheduled, even after they said they wanted me there. It's a good place to work if you have the right management."
Publix,Technician,4,"the job itself is really not that bad, but corporate gives us so much to do and we don’t have enough time to do everything and also the customers are so rude, but i guess that comes with it being a retail job"

Publix,Cashier,5,Very good with employees and lets you grow into whatever role you are looking to get into no matter of what your past experience is like highly recommend working here
Publix,Deli Clerk,2,"There are few who actually apply for the deli when applying to Publix, and fewer still that stay. If you have any fantasy of a consistent schedule in any way, this isn't it. I was hired on as full-time, and after 4 months still could not get a schedule with any consistency week to week. 6am-2pm one day and 2pm-11pm the next. Never the same days off, sometimes being scheduled to work 8 days in a row, with no overtime, because the company starts its scheduling on a Saturday.  At my location, there were 3 different deli managers, yes THREE, in a 5 month time span. While also having 2 assistant managers, and the communication being next to nothing. I asked my manager if we could sit down and chat for a few minutes about a few concerns, it took a full 2 weeks of asking every day for that to ever happen. The ""Publix Family"" Kool-Aid has gone sour since the founders passing it seems. Quickly becoming another highly corporatized chain.Really enjoyed most of my coworkers as we struggled to keep the ship afloat. Getting the regular customers that would know you by name was the highlight"
Publix,Cashier,1,"I worked at this publix for about 8 months and it brought me so much mental drain that i dreaded going into work every single day. The managers were very mean considering most of us were just high schoolers, and all of my coworkers were very cliquey and would start drama and talk about you when they thought you weren't listening. it seriously felt like being at school. "
Publix,Meat Clerk,2,Okay good but little help from management and working alone often. Scheduling is often a pain and ultimately you are disposable if you voice any complaints.
Publix,Grocery Clerk,1,Most of upper management do not know how to do their own job.                                                            Would never go back. Worse company I've ever delt with.
Publix,Selector,5,Very good if you're a physical person. If not definitely don't waste your time as you're on your feet running all day. Managers were nice and coworkers were chill. Hardest part is getting used to the physical aspect. 
Publix,Stocker,5,"Very happy with the company, unfortunately i had to quit but would go back anytime! The management was great and they always were there to help get you anymore training that you need!"
Publix,Customer Service,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The Team of support in each department.  The overall acknowledgment from supervisors. And the feedback that is given to improve performance. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?When your shift is short staffed due to employee calls out.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Depending on the location and area of the store.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Learning something new everyday.
Publix,Produce Clerk,3,"If you can sell your soul, great place. Otherwise, it drains you of all life and individuality. Anyone I know that's left has been significantly happier since. "
Publix,Grocery Clerk,4,great people and management everyone knows each other well and it makes it much easier and more fun to get the job done every day. feels like a family
Publix,Meat Cutter,3," It  was  pretty  ok  they  had  good  benefits use to have good bonuses the stock is the best benefit they have, can retire with alot of stock they give it to you for free for so many hours worked "
Publix,rph,4,The workflow is not bad. Just focus on customer services. The pay is decent with good benefits. Some DMs were very nice; others were horrible. Make it or break it depends on who your supervisor is.
Publix,Front Service Clerk/Cashier,2,"If you’ve never worked before and you’re young it’s a ok option but I wouldn’t recommend it for long term. The coworkers are usually nice and friendly. The pay is not good at all, raises aren’t great or fair and management doesn’t tell you the truth or value your work. You do more to get paid less."
Publix,Deli Clerk,3,I love the weekly pay. If you're a full timer you will always get hours. If you're part time good luck depends on the time of year might get like 15 hours. They will work till you burnout. 
Publix,Cashier,5,great place to workIt was very great first job for anyone looking for work experience. Schedule is very flexible and management is very reasonable. I really enjoyed my time there. 
Publix,Cashier,3,Hard to get full time and part time hours are not consistent or enough . I did enjoy the environment and the little things they would do for employees though. 
Publix,Grocery Stocker,4,The job is pretty easy to do as a grocery clerk. They pay pretty decent and management is okay for the most part. Management can make or break the job
Publix,Deli Associate,1,No work and home life balance. Expected to multitask production and orders while helping customers. No break from standing. No appreciation for showing initiative. They only treat new employees better until the next set comes in. False job security. Management offers advancement only to make their jobs easier just to be passed up over and over for promotion.
Publix,Deli Clerk,5,"I love working for Publix Deli. It is a fast-paced environment with hard-working, knowledgeable employees. The training is fantastic and thorough. The Deli managers are terrific, and the store, in general, is a great place to work.  If you are lazy, don't bother working here. You must be proactive and willing to learn."
Publix,Publix Deli Clerk,2,"No matter how hard you try they won't promote you unless the manager personally likes you and they will pick at anything they can. Drama in the deli is insufferable and everyone including managers take part. They WILL hire new people at a higher pay then you, even after raises new hires were still paid more doing half the work"
Publix,Customer Service,3,A good job to get you thru College. Work life balance is not good however. But other than that the benefits are good and scheduling is too. Stock keeps us
Publix,Cashier/Customer Service,4,People are nice and so is the management but the pay is minimum wage/ as low as they possibly can. they take forever to give you a raise when you move up in the company but if you plan on becoming a manager some day the pay it pretty good. 
Publix,Dock Worker/Forklift Operator,3,Some managers and co workers are okay to work for and with. They could use an update with the pay rate. Seniority is definitely a factor here. If you can apply for any position higher than sanitation.
Publix,Deli Clerk,5,"Good coworkers, great job, walkthroughs and experienced people everywhere that can help. All around, a great experience that I wish was more commonplace."
Publix,Associate,3,"Publix offers a good job, and a potential at a career if you stick around long enough. The scheduling of hours was the only complaint, if you’re part time they tended to leave you off the schedule if you asked for too much variation. "
Publix,Customer Service/Cashier,4,Great company to work for however it can be hard to get hours. If you have good managers and good peers around you it will be fun. It really is your typical retail job
Publix,Cashier,4,Easy and simple job people are very nice and very good environment when starting out with new job just need grow into the company and they give great benefits .
Publix,Bagger,3,"I was hired in 2020 and doing a review now. Went in thinking it was positive overall and still think it probably is. I was hired near the start of the pandemic, and things were still being figured out. I also missed having some initial paper work done and wasn't necessarily given all info (for being on register) to feel like I properly could do my job. however this was in the pandemic and were busy with that. I didn't stay too long to find out if it got better. several people I know do enjoy working there."
Publix,Deli Clerk,5,Great place to work if you’re looking to build a career for yourself and work your way to the top. If you show initiative and care you can go far. They seemed to always be looking for someone to move up in the ranks. 
Publix,Customer Service Associate,2,Great job for high school students.  There is  very little to none opportunities to get full time. It doesn’t matter how hard you work or the fact you are always on time. 
Publix,Bagger,2,"very boring, low pay, customers were annoying to deal with. (especially the old people who wanted their stuff bagged a specific way at the cashier) but every store location differs. managers were okish. a great place to shop but a horrible place to work. really only good for starter jobs. "
Publix,Baker,4,Decent pay for the work and great people to work with. Learned a lot in the short time I was there. A lot of skills I can use in future roles. I was never bored. And there is a lot of room for growth if you’re willing to learn and work hard. Good benefits and perks. 
Publix,Publix,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Publix is a company, Where Shopping is a Pleasure. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?No Stressing, just do your Job, giving great Customer Service. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great environment to work for. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Typical day is everyday you do the best you can."
Publix,Manager,5,"Good environment, nice people to work with. If you want a 40-50 hours a week job, this is possibly gonna be a good choice for you. Don’t expect a bunch of promotion, you will be where you’re at in the next couple of years. "
Publix,Deli Clerk,1,"A typical day at work is me starting production work for the company which mean starting and preparing for customer who would like hot food, slice meat and cheese and fresh subs. What I learned from Publix is how to give great customer service. The management at don't know who to be great managers so not all. The reason why I say this is because if you're part time, they like to cut your hours. The hardest part of the job is dealing with different people personality. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers. "
Publix,Produce Clerk,2,Fire you without notice and not even care when it's your side of the story will always take the higher up side regardless of the situation or the matter 
Publix,Deli Clerk/Cook,5,"Deli chaos during lunch hoursI improved my time management skillsManagement was supportive, but changes a lotCulture friendly and supportive Hardest part was lunchtimes and events/holidays Enjoyable part was the people i got to work with"
Publix,Grocery Stocker,4,The job is pretty easy to do as a grocery clerk. They pay pretty decent and management is okay for the most part. Management can make or break the job
Publix,Customer Service Associate,3,I’m very disappointed with management. I’m being ACCUSED for something that has nothing to do with another and they are making one situation the reason. 
Publix,Produce Manager,4,Publix is a grind. Hard physical work. Managers work 10 hrs daily with little help. It's I decent company but has changed over the years and they have cut back on help and overtime hours.
Publix,Baker,4,"Usually a fun place to work, as far as retail/grocery stores go, but management can be challenging at times. They rotate all managers whether it be department or store semi-often, so some times the management is great and really care about employees, and other times you can tell that the manager in question was there long enough to be promoted."
Publix,Deli Associate,5, Most enjoyable part is great lunches. Work environment is really productive. Hardest part is short breaks and dealing with Back pain and muscle aches.
Publix,Customer Service Staff,4,"I had a great time working and advancing my customer service experience working at Publix. Met a lot of great people, whether it be customers or co-workers."
Publix,Bagger,5,Great environment to be at. Loved working there and being with the team and the managers. Good overall environment that supports all the employees. Thanks 
Publix,Deli Clerk,5,Like I said before great place to work at the managers were great and my coworkers were great as well.I would cut for the subshop Make popcorn Cut deli meat Make subs 
Publix,Grocery Stocker,1,"Apparently the location I worked at was notorious for being the worst in the whole state of Virginia so i don’t know if this can be applied to any other Publix. Short on staff all the time due to the poor treatment and neglect of employees and any or all concerns and complaints they have. Management would constantly belittle every employee while simultaneously complaining about their own jobs being an “absolute nightmare” never balancing or evenly distributing the work load amongst the employees they did have. Many new higher would leave on their first week if not the first day. Which led to them relying heavily on the more elderly employees to do the VERY physically demanding work of unloading the trucks, pulling the massive pallets and stocking the isle being as they had fewer opportunities to find a new place to work. It was actually really sad to see. Even with lower than standard pay,  up to 12 hour shifts and grueling labor. Seeing the treatment of the older yet most loyal employees was above all was why I left."
Publix,Pharmacy Technician,5,Great company to work for! Great pay and Benefits .Lots of on the Job training and learning .A lot of friendly customers and co workers .Very structured environment.
Publix,Deli Clerk,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great energy everyday love the environment What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Being able to clock out on time.  Closing on timeWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?The environment is definitely peaceful.  Lots a different types of people of  different  cultures I am able to see many. I. A Great energy so I attract the same energy's What is a typical day like for you at the company?Compliment, smiles, small chats , busy, positive energy"
Publix,Cashier,3,"The store was clean and my customers were mostly nice. Its a customer service job so there are always pros and cons, but overall my experience was pretty neutral. "
Publix,GRS,1,Never looking back...horrible work environment. Very physical labor and way too much drama. Never again will I work so hard just to get a 25 cent raise every 6 months
Publix,Grocery Team Leader,3,Don’t try to move up. Hours get worst and theres associates getting paid more by the hour than assistant managers. Just do your job get good at something specific and stay there. Believe me you will make more money that way and have stability
Publix,Manager,5,Wonderful retirement plan.  good opportunities for growth.  Empowered to take care of customers and ensure a customer never leaves unhappy.  Cooperative team members
Publix,Meat Cutter,1,"Everyplace you look you will see the company slogan "" a great place to work"" but it is just a slogan. It is like they have to put that on everything an associate interacts with to brainwash them into enjoying working there. Management is beyond bloated. They have a manager and assistant manager for each department to micro manage you during the day. Most days the assistant is actually supposed to be filling the role of a working associate.....only to disapear and leave you to pick up the slack for the employee they were supposed to replace. Managers are extremely disrespectful when talking to other employees, if they are bilingual the will purposly change the language they are speaking mid conversation when a non speaking employee of that 2nd language appears. Certain employees speak their native language at work with non native employees in order undermine moral and they do this with impunity. If you are not in a protected class then Publix could care less about you. You are just a body and can be replaced. You are expected to work with no break after 4 hours and forced each day to take a hour lunch.  You are expected to work like a servant. They promise when you are hired you wil be full time but they have zero intention of every promoting you to full time. You will be a part time employee with zero benefits. Publix is the most expensive grocery store and does not offer an employee discount on anything. Publix is not a great place to work, avoid at all cost."
Publix,"Customer Service Rep,  Front End Manager ",5,I just Loved working for Publix never had a bad day there. My son was killed while I was working there and I couldn't reach for my phone when he was calling. So they did everything to keep me hired I chose to live it was too much for me  at that time. 
Publix,Pharmacy Technician,3,Corporate demands too much for Pharmacy and unrealistic expectations. Hours dictated by corporate don't make sense and makes pharmacy crew extremely understaffed and overworked. Be prepared to do the work of 2-3 people
Publix,Cashier/Customer Service,4,"side job i needed to help me get by school. very nice atmosphere of course pay is not high but not too bad. it was a great experience. I do recommend it, it is very laidback. stocking is great, benefits are great too,"
Publix,Front Service Clerk,5,"Good company, great benefits, and they treat you like a human being. I wish I would have stayed as I know I could have grown with the company and been set up for my future"
Publix,Cashier,4,"Worked there part time as a college student, very flexible hours. Management was always changing but most of them were good for the most part. Customers sucked though. "
Publix,Grocery Stocker,4,The job is pretty easy to do as a grocery clerk. They pay pretty decent and management is okay for the most part. Management can make or break the job
Publix,Cashier,5,Best working environment. Professional and honest. Very friendly atmosphere. Supportive team work. Great pay. Flexible schedule. Great Human Resources. 
Publix,Deli Associate,4,"I’ve been with Publix for 3 years and I can say that it honestly is a great company to work for because you can advance from clerk, to manager, to store manager and get paid what you deserve. I’ve been with 2 stores so far and the only problems can be that it can have a high school mentality with the people you work with. Drama can easily start and the people they do promote can be questionable but as long as you have the right spirit, you can easily get promoted. We get raises every year and if you’re good then you can get full time hours if needed or even work as little hours per week if you need. Overall, great company!"
Publix,Cashier,5,"flexible schedule, management was supportive. lots of team members that were always willing to help. company really does their best to keep employees happy, competitive pay."
Publix,Customer Service Staff,4,"Publix is a good company to work for. As a part-time associate that changed availabilities depending on college classes, Publix was flexible with the hours I was able to work. "
Publix,Meat Clerk/Stocker,1,"Bullying, targeting, harmful behaviors, retaliation. I’ve seen vetted associates be treated like trash there. Performance punishment is a day to day activity. It’s a game of ego vs politics with managers. Hr tries to help but managers lie to cover any issues & associates are afraid to tell the truth. "
Publix,Service Deli Assistant,1," -Once I put my two weeks in they treated me worst, putting me in positions that require more than one staff member alone and telling me that I could have done better. A typical day at work usually started with enough people, but managers would refuse to put enough people for the whole shift. They claimed that the system only allowed them to give employees a set amount of hours, but we knew there was plenty of leeway. Managers would put new hires on as regular employees, not allowing for the correct training and causing many of these new hires to quit immediately. Managers expect employees to keep up with the impossible, and they would consistently just watch us struggle instead of stepping in to help in areas they were knowledgable of. When I put in a new availability for school they completely ignored it and I had to submit it 3 times just for them to still act like it did not exist. Even when I was a senior in highschool they would stray outside of my availability. The workplace in the deli in 4601 lindsey crossing is not a pleasant one at all."
Publix,Cashier,4,Nice place for your first job. Worked there through high school and college. Management changed a lot in the years I was there but not bad overall.  Pay started off better than I expected and got raises. 
Publix,Cashier,4,"Job was pretty chill, schedule was pretty flexible and I got along with my coworkers pretty well. There were some days I felt pretty stressed but I still had a good run."
Publix,Stocker,3,Favoritism sometimes and there's always problems but thats almost every job. Do your work and then go home. Wake up do the same thing again. 8 hours shifts if you want to move up open availability is key and be reliable.
Publix,Grocery Clerk,4,it was a decent place to work. Managers aren’t crazy but the pay is pretty low and they are flexible with your schedule if need be. Sometimes we stay late
Publix,Part Time Grocery Clerk,5,Great place to work. Best retail work place. Great management. Have a lot of opportunity to grow but it will take time. I enjoy working here with people. 
Publix,Team Leader,5,My normal day at work is very productive. My only challenge is my coworkers cant make it to work which means more load for us. It is a great to work with so many opportunities to grow.
Publix,Deli Associate,3,"If your manager in your department is rude or disrespectful, good luck. Management won't help with your complaints. All Publix's are different, some worse than others."
Publix,Deli Clerk,3,"Clock in. Prepare for daily tasks and possible unexpected outcomes. Serve customers efficiently and courteously. Answer all inquiries knowledgeably and clearly.Management gets easily tripped up when something goes unexpectedly.Workplace culture is fine, in regards to the employees themselves, as for management and anyone higher, it is a total mess.Hardest part of the job is when managers don't listen to associate ideas or take them into consideration in regards to improving efficiency and productivity in the workplace.Must enjoyable part of the job was being able to satisfy the customer."
Publix,Deli Clerk,4,It's a good company to work at. I will say that the work can vary on the management you get. I've worked with plenty of great managers who are willing to push you to better your skills; but  I've also worked with a few who just didn't really care that much.
Publix,Customer Service,4,Publix is a wonderful place to work. Upper management can always be better but my associates were always helpful and nice to be around. It was a pleasure working there.
Publix,Security Officer,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?They do provide free lunches. Co workers are great! They pay weekly.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management needs improvement! Why I was there Supervisor would give Management your performance evaluation. Management would change your assessment!What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic. Work culture is great! Management is a joke. Just remember what they say you can make money you can make is an illusion. Example: Top pay that they tell you is a downright lie. Good Luck!What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful, undervalued, hard work doesn’t make a difference. Rules are made up and never believe Management."
Publix,Cashier,1,"Unless it's your first job don't do it.High priced store paying minimum wage. Terrible management. Really awful.They use minimum wage workers as janitors, "
Publix,Front Service Clerk,5,The job gives great experience for the work force and allows opportunities to grow. If you have a good team this willbe a rewarding experience. I highly recommend applying.
Publix,Certified Immunizing Pharmacy Technician,5,"I absolutely loved working in the pharmacy. The biggest downside to this job was that I only spoke English and a good majority of the customers didn’t, so communication was difficult."
Publix,Grocery Stocker,4,The job is pretty easy to do as a grocery clerk. They pay pretty decent and management is okay for the most part. Management can make or break the job
Publix,Customer Service Representative,3,"it can be good or bad depending on location and who your managers are. they promote from within which is nice, but if you’re very competent and don’t plan on moving up they will work you like a dog if you let them. assert yourself and you’ll be okay. very hard to get fired from publix"
Publix,Grocery Department/ Stocker,5,My typical day is very busy. I have learned a lot with Publix since I have worked a few different departments.Management is fair with their employee's. The hardest part is that i am currently not getting enough hours and I am eager to work. The most enjoyable to working with friendly people that want to see you grow within the company. 
Publix,Cashier,5,The sigma alpha is very nice to work with. I feel so skibbidy when people talk to me. Its overal the best job ive worked at ever. The employees are nice.
Publix,Front Service Clerk/Cashier,3,I’ve have been here for 2 years and I still get bad hours. They have favorites and when u need hours they say we will give them to you and do it for a couple weeks and then stop. I also asked to switch departments and they told me I couldn’t or there was no room and then people would switch to where I was asking to go
Publix,Full Time Associate,3,Come in and you’re instantly behind because they don’t hold anyone accountable in the mornings. I learned nothing even tho I’ve asked to be trained on other things. Management sucks plays favorites and also will target those they dislike and be overly critical with them and have a short fuse with those same individuals. Culture is there but not really shown. Jobs easy hardest part is dealing with the people they hire and the people they REFUSE to let go. Everyone is supposed to do a bit of everything in our job and when you don’t you get spoken to most the time expect for 3-4 people who seem to have special privilege and will only do one thing even when asked to help elsewhere they wont. Only thing enjoyable is what you find enjoyable like if you enjoy organizing or talking to customers or cleaning 
Publix,Cashier,5,The workplace here is pretty good and decent but I will not lie to you .co-workers usually make or break a workplace and the co-workers were so amazing and kind customers are so so some good some bad and the pay was pretty good too but it does get busy so you have to keep up the pace.
Publix,Cashier/Customer Service,4,great place to work. coworkers and diverse in both race and age group. Employees are chill and fun people who don't hassle you too much.Give lengthy breaks for minors
Publix,Cashier/Customer Service,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?The benefits were awesome. It's not difficult to advance in the company. They have a lot of great programs. You can transfer between departments so you can find your nicheWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The coupons can be difficult at times but most of the time the computer will take off the discount. Unfortunately you have the scammers that make you really unsure if it's good or not and the computer won't catch it so you need to.It was very difficult to get enough hours to just work at Publix, I had to have a second jobWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Professional and friendly. The cashiers were good about helping each other out, example: if one cashier has a big order that she will have to bag and the cashier next to them does not have anybody waiting they will jump over and help the cashier with the big order bag up the orderWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Consistent and routine.From the food to the customers you can always count on consistency. The regulars have their routine and you know what they like. Makes a cashier's job easier"
Publix,Cashier,5,"Fantastic service, friendly staff, and top-notch quality! This local gem never disappoints. Highly recommend for anyone looking for excellent value and care!"
Publix,Stocker,3,"While working at publix is normally a good option for most people, publix from my experience doesn’t care about their employees and often the managers don’t care either "
Publix,Stock Clerk,5,good company when i had work there.the deli is great. i find myself craving their chicken tender sub often. it goes really well with their wedges too.
Publix,Customer Service Representative,3,Had a great time working here but as soon as management switched up it was horrible. The raises are almost nothing which sucks but again your managers and colleagues make the environment. 
Publix,Cashier,3,"Publix is a really good job for the first little bit. As a part timer, your hours can be cut whenever they feel like, but if you have good management, that offsets it. Good benefits, even at part time."
Publix,Deli Associate,4,"I worked in the Deli for half a year. This a great company to work for, and the management in this location were helpful and upstanding.  Though deli work could be busy, dirty, and sometimes understaffed."
Publix,Supervisor,4,"Being a supervisor at Publix is rewarding. You lead a dedicated team, ensure smooth operations, and foster a positive environment focused on customer satisfaction."
Publix,Cashier/Customer Service,4,Good first job to get started in the work force was hard for me to get promoted depends on managers. Flexible schedules too and I can say this from my experience but overall very caring managers.
Publix,Selector/Loader,3,Not a bad place overall but the produce warehouse is like the Wild West. Nothing overly complicated with the job though it is definitely a physically demanding job 
Publix,Cashier,1,Working here is never fun unless you have someone to talk to Management is clearly bias towards certain individualsWhen you come in you always feel drained and exhausted The front is always so uptight that it’s tiring you really feel limited in expressing yourselfMost of the people you are working with have some big insecurity and bring it out on others however it is easy to make friends with one another 
Publix,Overnight Stocker,5,Treats you with respect and good benefits and gives you the opportunity to move up in the business very straightfoward company and will tell you how to work better to achieve better goals
Publix,Deli Clerk,4,What is the best part of working at the company?Great Environenent. Paid at timeWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Some exigent customers. Advice and bad commentsWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Associates sharing their knowledge
USAA,"Design Educator, Facilitator & Coach",4,"It's a great place to work where you can find amazingly kind people. In terms of creativity and technology, they have some distance to go still. They care deeply about their members so I think that will serve them well into the future."
USAA,Insurance Professional- III,2,My coworkers are the only amazing thing about the job. The job sucks and I would have regular anxiety attacks just being at my desk. Metrics are ridiculous. They make it sound amazing during training but you quickly find out that it’s not all it seems to be. 
USAA,Claims Adjuster,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Much better than average paid time off per year, decent benefits, nice office. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The low pay and the constant hiring of your potential replacement. They churn and burn a little too much here. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?They try to promote an inclusive and ""fun"" environment but at the same time, they never stop adding more and more to your work load for no more pay.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Feeling like this is not the long term answer and just what I'm having to do right now. If they paid about 50% more in 2024, it might actually feel like a career."
USAA,Member Relationship Specialist,3,Was great when I started.  Good benefits and good people.  Became extremely sales focused over time and very stressful place to work.  Difficult to break out of customer service pathway. 
USAA,Insurance Professional,3,"It's call center environment. Tons if metrics to worry about and they keep adding more. Whatever they tell you know that sales is the only thing that really matters . Lots of talk about serving the military community, but it's more of a sales gimmick these days. Not really any different than other major insurance company. Make sales and you'll be golden, struggle and you'll likely burn out in a few months or be fired. Benefits are pretty good if you can handle the job. 26 people in my hiring class. Only 5 remained after a year."
USAA,Member Assistance Program,1,What is the best part of working at the company?The pay is the only thing that keeps people there!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?What management expects is ridiculous. That company sucks the life out of a person. There are so many people on short term disability just to escape but still survive.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Terrible. Management does not support you if you are not a high performing employee.
USAA,IT Specialist,1,"Okay job, but a lot of work and a lot ot overtime. As a contractor from another country, there are no benefits through USAA and the benefits I get from my talent agency are medicore. "
USAA,Property Adjuster,1,If you are an MSR working claims you are actually working as a call center as well.  You have to meet metrics as if you are in a call center environment but also expected to handle claims with a full caseload.  So imagine being on the phone taking status calls for 3 hours and then only having 4 hours to work your claims because you also have a 30 min lunch and 2 15 minute breaks.  But you’re supposed to be productive with 4 hours of your day dedicated to claim handling.  It makes nos sense.
USAA,MSR,4,"Great benefit, great pay and can be somewhat flexible. There is room for advancement. The job can be stressful and constant micromanaging.  Benefits is what keeps people there"
USAA,Customer Service Representative,5,"The secret to USAA’s success is who they serve.   When all of your members are willing to raise their right hand and swear they are willing to die for their country, there is no better filter to loyalty, honesty and integrity.  "
USAA,New Member Educator,5,"Very demanding job as far as what is expected of you. As long as you are a fast learner and willing to accept change, you will love your time at USAA pay is great and culture is great as well."
USAA,Claims Adjuster,3,Very demanding and stressful workload.  It can be extremely difficult to handle the workload and do a thorough job at the same time. There is a revolving door of employees and management with little consistency.
USAA,ISR II,4,Overall I would say it was a great place to work. I just didn't like when it turned too sales heavy and lost their focus. Too much focus placed on meeting sales metrics.
USAA,Credit Card Specialist,2,"There really isn't much positive to say about this job. The call queue was constantly backed up and the calls were back to back with no breaks in between to breathe or wrap you head around a frustrating call from an angry member. You were talked to by your manager if you did get a bad rating on a call, regardless or not if you did your best to de-escalate a situation. Managers rarely respond to questions in chats if you need help. Helpline is the last resort you should use and is measured in metrics if you do call them. Pushing members for more products is highly sought after and you have to become ""certified"" to start recommending products for the other lines of business. You have to stick to a specific script for every basic opening and ending of your calls. Compliant crazy measures in the bank business which can also result in a talking to from your manager if you do not adhere to their compliance rules. Most enjoyable part of this job were the potlucks and occasional spirit weeks, or if your team had an event planned/meeting with food, but every day felt the same if you worked in the call center. Only those without a member contact based job got to enjoy the actual amenities of being in office since they didn't have to be tied down to a desk all day and milked for every second of their time. I tried to get out of working weekends but it was not part of ""business needs"" at the moment so too bad so sad basically, and the hours were 11:30am-8:00pm, the worst of the worst. Good luck having a social life now. It's not worth the money if you can't spend it with with the people - more..."
USAA,"Payment Operations Specialist, Wire Transfer",3,"Work was good before all the changes because we were more inclusive in the decisions on training now it just seems like the company was more about business versus like a work life balance, which made it very stressful to have issues to talk about or even personal time off that we needed they never made it Easy for us to request the time off that we needed, but just the morale of the actual department was very different with the new management that we were given."
USAA,Data Entry,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Having a good understanding bossWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The micro management system and not meeting expectations What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very good and very culture oriented What is a typical day like for you at the company?Having a good productive day overall
USAA,Claims Contact Representative,5,"Workplace culture is great, NEO is a very organized session and helpful and the staff members are also very friendly. The benefits are also amazing. Great place to work"
USAA,Senior Software Engineer,3,"As the company became larger and fell under increasing regulatory scrutiny, it became less personal and the mission became more of a side note than a driving force. People have been increasingly become a number, a metric…..  People are being forced toMake a choice between what is best for their family and being able toContinue at USAA"
USAA,NEW MEMBER ACQUISITIONS SENIOR & FACILITATOR ,3,"Luckily I took advantage of the tuition assistance, not tuition reimbursement. Obtained both bachelors and masters with no school loans. After 2022, usaa has tuition reimbursement, where the employee pays for education and gets reimbursed up to a dollar limit."
USAA,Software Engineer,5,Nice work life balance . I don’t have any bad experiences with the company . I will recommend anyone to work for the company . Nice culture in the company. 
USAA,Bank Sales & Service Contact Center Representative ,3,USAA pay and benefits (perks) are great but the job is draining and their standards are unrealistically high. The toll it takes on your mental health is not worth it. 
USAA,"Design Educator, Facilitator & Coach",4,"It's a great place to work where you can find amazingly kind people. In terms of creativity and technology, they have some distance to go still. They care deeply about their members so I think that will serve them well into the future."
USAA,Director,1,You go to usaa for the party and bonuses the culture and executive management do not care about their employees and only want to hire their friends to roles they open
USAA,Insurance Agent,2,"High stress environment, leadership does not listen to needs of employees. Worked here for 4 years it’s not about what you know and bring to the table it’s about who you know "
USAA,Non-Injury Auto Claims Adjuster,3,The management is inconsistent and the workload is unmanageable. The pay was the only thing that kept me there for so long. They really make you work for your check. 
USAA,Member Service Representative,4,"The benefits are great, leaders that help work with you and attempt to help with things out of your control. Overall, the expectations and amount of work  is expected for a call center but I feel the company wants 100% perfection and when your taking back to back calls for 8+hours perfection isn’t always achievable. One mistake can make you fall out of green and member surveys I don’t agree should be a part of metrics especially when it was a call you had no control over to help achieve the members satisfaction. The pay as well, although consider “high” I feel doesn’t reflect on the amount of stress and workload. "
USAA,Risk Management Analyst,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Healthy points and military focusWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Layoffs, reorgs and still in consent orderWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Hired too many employees from other banks and government and work feels like other banks and government.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Listen to employees gossip and talk smack about other teams"
USAA,Nma,3,"It was a good experience aside from some management, lots of unaccountably. They do put in the effort to train their employees and offer great resources. "
USAA,HR Business Partner,4,Great opportunity to learn and grow your career through tuition benefits and programs to help to gain skills on current job. Worked there for more than 10 years
USAA,Insurance Professional II,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Promised pay increases for training in more categories but they don't give them. Metric standards don't meet the lack of compensation. They hid behind being there for the military & their families but will out you in debt then not care. Do Not waste your time unless mental wellness is a low priority in your life.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Poor compensation for required metrics. Unsupportive managers that complain about your work on weekly one on one mtgs. Everytime you see your manager they point your faults out instead of appreciate the work completed.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Fake, hypocrisy at its finest. Executive jet expense but charge members for monthly stmts  because of overhead costs. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Wanting to get off from when you clock in"
USAA,Insurance Adjuster,1,"training is great and the support is thereonce you get to the floor and are in ""nesting"" with your team be prepared to get very little support from most of management- they rather not help and just hang out and chat and wonder the building get starbucks etc. Starbucks and the cafeteria is nice to have and to get quick snacks. the actual hot food is pricey and small portions better off going off site for lunch you'd pay the same if not less for more. the pay and benefits are great but the work load is stressful if you don't know what you are doing and don't get the proper support especially being new to the production floor. Always watch your back because someone is always watching. If you think they live by their core values they don't. I witnessed on several occasions people breaking the rules, fabricating metrics etc and when reported I was the one who was on a radar and eventually let go. your manager is always prepared to get you screwed over and  its an 'every man for himself' type of vibe. "
USAA,Banking Specialist,5,This company is honestly great to work for . It’s family oriented they care about your mental health and your family and you in general would definitely recommend 
USAA,Claims Operations Manager,4,"Long time employee here. Good benefits, there have been some changes to benefits package over the years. Alot of changes the last couple of years.  Expect to work hard, esp if in claims department. Very call center-like. "
USAA,Insurance Agent,1,"Growth is difficult, company pushes sales too hard. Company would rather deal with turning and burning over focusing on current employee climate. Pay is alright."
USAA,VP,1,"Do not work here. What was once a good company has fallen so badly. Customer service has dipped, employee benefits have been cut and remote work promises have been reneged. Go find work somewhere else with a company that is growing. "
USAA,Sales Associate,5,Just started at USAA and so far I enjoy it. Looking forward to learning more! The training is long but helpful I think and those I work with are all kind and fun to work with! 
USAA,Insurance Agent,3,Worked there for 6 years. All and all it’s not a bad job. I learned a lot about sales that I can take elsewhere. Job would be better if they didn’t play favorites and there was more room for advancement.
USAA,Member Service Representative,3,This job pays pretty well with some pretty good benefits however they are still not worth the mental anguish you experience from the impossible metrics to the impossible business practices and members. 
USAA,Auto Adjuster,1,"Working as an auto claims adjuster at USAA has been a challenging experience, and not in a good way. The workload is consistently overwhelming, with unrealistic performance expectations and little to no support from management. You’re expected to handle a high volume of claims with tight deadlines, often resulting in long hours and burnout.Training feels inadequate for the complexity of the job, and the systems we use are outdated, causing unnecessary delays and frustration. The culture is less about teamwork and more about numbers and metrics, leaving little room for genuine collaboration or growth.Compensation might seem competitive at first glance, but it doesn’t truly reflect the amount of work or stress involved. There’s a constant feeling that the company prioritizes profits over people — both customers and employees alike. If you’re looking for a workplace where you feel valued and supported, this isn’t it.This review captures common criticisms about workload, management, support, and work-life balance that might be found in such roles."
USAA,Executive Resolution Specialist,3,The pay and bonuses were great. Within 3 years I went from $19/hr to almost $24/hr. Was almost worth the mental exhaustion and verbal abuse from customers. 
USAA,Property Claims Adjuster,4,"You receive a seven minute window in an hourly role to get to your workstation and be prepared to start your day. You also receive that for every break. I applied at least three times, and the process of getting hired was very scattered, and I was told different information several times. If this happens to you, do not let it deter you. The company is still great to work for and a lot of people apply numerous times before they are hired. Opportunities of advancement are always available. Compensation is on the lower end for the role comparatively to other companies with similar fields, but again it depends on whether or not you’re willing to sacrifice that pay for their benefits."
USAA,Senior Product Manager,4,Definitely a great company with a great cause but it has had some better days in the past. Now that they’ve announced the current CEO is retiring hopefully the future will be a lot brighter again 
USAA,"Design Educator, Facilitator & Coach",4,"It's a great place to work where you can find amazingly kind people. In terms of creativity and technology, they have some distance to go still. They care deeply about their members so I think that will serve them well into the future."
USAA,Customer Service Representative,3,"Between the extremely tough metrics, back to back calls, bland office cubicle, and members (customers) screaming and  berating you on almost every call it's not for everyone. It's very corporate on the inside."
USAA,Insurance Professional,2,"I personally find nothing enjoyable about this position. They constantly push you to push products and every all counts against your acquisition rate, even if you transfer or if they aren’t even calling for something you can do. It all counts against you."
USAA,Associate Adjuster ,3,"This company has amazing benefits & gives away cool prizes & perks. But you will be babysat with everything you do. Get everything in writing & notate everything you do. Because without documentation it is not honored. That goes for HR all the way to your claims. Some colleagues here are a bit cutthroat, so be careful & keep a low profile."
USAA,Auto Adjuster,3,"Very high workload,  changes were in progress to make things better but move to in person from remote outweighed the good. Management was supportive.  "
USAA,Contracts Advisor,2,"A typical day at USAA, through Millennium Group, starts with the unsettling realization that no matter how hard you work or how dedicated you are, your efforts will never be enough if you’re not part of the inner circle. Despite this, I consistently maintained a high level of productivity, addressing issues swiftly and effectively—actions that were acknowledged and praised by the client. However, that recognition meant little in an environment where favoritism and office politics dictate your future.What I Believe I Learned: I learned that professionalism and a strong work ethic can be completely undermined by a toxic workplace culture that prioritizes cliques over competence. This experience has taught me that no amount of dedication can protect you from the arbitrary and retaliatory decisions of management if you dare to seek better opportunities elsewhere.Management: The management at both USAA and Millennium Group is a glaring example of everything wrong with corporate leadership. My unjust dismissal following a simple request for a reference check was nothing short of retaliatory. Leadership's inability to provide clear reasons for my termination, coupled with dismissive and inconsistent responses, highlighted a complete lack of transparency and integrity. It seems management is more concerned with maintaining their control and power dynamics than with fostering a fair and supportive work environment.Workplace Culture: The workplace culture is toxic, dominated by favoritism, cliques, and a pervasive sense of insecurity. If you’re not in with the right group, you’re - more..."
USAA,Casualty Adjuster,5,"USAA is a wonderful company to work for.  They are dependable, educated, caring and do a lot for their employees.  They have a wonderful training program and all the managers are well versed in their roles.  The workload is manageable.  If you do not use your PTO they ask that you take time off so you do.  Managers care about your social emotional wellbeing not just the work product you produce.   A lot of employees work for USAA until their retire.  Great company to work for long term.  "
USAA,Decision Science Analyst,4,"USAA is mission focused and stands by their core values. Growth can, at times, be tough due to the volume of work, especially in the call center environment, but growth is still possible and depending on what direction you want your career to move in, can be a slow burn. "
USAA,Fraud Analyst II,3,"The company had good benefits, but our schedule was changed often. It also required us to lose shift DIF—meh employment. The bonuses are amazing! They had good PTO, but most of their jobs you have to start in the call center..."
USAA,Service Desk Tier I,1,"Toxic work environment with fake smiling employees. Quick to offer their hand to help, but just as quick to make you look bad to a lead or manager. Management is so lazy, they make the people collecting unemployment people at home look bad. Management does zero investigation into issues. Management feels empowered by arrogant senior management, only because they were given government contracts. They treat their contract staff as if their second rate, by berating them, talking behind their backs(saw this first hand unfortunately.) I watched someone train their replacement with our lead firing that person shortly after. "
USAA,Customer Service Representative,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The mission to help military service members and their families.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Constant change is the SOP’s.  It’s the nature of the business due to the changing state requirements and they need to do this in the US as well as any country the services are provided.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?GREAT… you can be who you are.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Mostly busy… their are or course Peak periods as well as Slack periods.
USAA,Property Adjuster,1,"Management doesn’t care, they lead with fear. At one point everyone on one team was on a PIP. They constantly make decisions to punish employees instead of seeing the actual driving factor of their issues which is too much work and not enough employees to manage it. They aren’t even backfilling positions when people leave"
USAA,Member Solutions Senior Specialist,3,"Good benefits but the company wants us to sell insurance that is more than double what our competitors are offering. After ""building the relationship"" with the customer for an hour, we let them down with the price. It gets monotonous. No sales bonuses or commission. "
USAA,Banking Advocate and Sales Specialist,2,I loved at first then realized it has a shut up culture. If you bring an issue even 1x you will never advance there even if its a legal or compliance issue. If have a medical issue will terminate you regardless of how long you've been employeed or experience. Has grat benefits but will sacrifice mental and physical health.
USAA,Insurance Agent,4,I  left the company only because at the time I had a situation that required me to take some time to step away. Overall the experience working for USAA was one that was supportive and very upfront and clear on my role. 
USAA,Insurance Agent,5,Usaa is a great company for benefits and pay. Don’t stay long… eventually new leadership will be hired and squeeze you and your manager eventually. People managers are a coin flip.
USAA,Insurance Professional,2,"PROS:Was able to work remote was a plusDecent 401k matchThey pay for Higher EducationHourly wage + annual bonusGreat job for someone with a HS diploma or GEDCONS:  Overworked, B2B phone callsThey push for sales, but there's no commissionDead end position as an IP"
USAA,Lead Development Product Owner,4,"Good mission and values. As is with most large organizations leadership draws a certain personality type. At USAA its command and control due to it hiring many recently retired Active Duty Officers. It does attract higher caliber individuals but, USAA does have an aspect of knowing one's place in the organization and staying in your lane. Title and rank are a large part of its day-to-day culture.The heart of its people and caliber of hire is high so, being surrounded by talented and caring individuals is refreshing and focused on making a meaningful difference for military service members and their family is a huge focus. You do get a good feeling at the end of the day knowing the mission is noble. Or, you believe it's just another company trying to make a buck. Ultimately, it's up to you and how you see it but, it will affect your mobility in the company."
USAA,Claims Adjuster,1,you’ll be treated better elsewhere. growing pains with nobody listening to the experience hired in. long tailed claims never seem to go away but always end up on your desk. 
USAA,Member Service Representative,5,Great place to work for the pay they offer. Very micromanaged so will work if you have no selfDiscipline to manage yourself. And very metric measured so it works forPeople that like to be applauded for having a script. 
USAA,Business Advisor,3,Hard to get promoted in my opinion. The best chance to significant pay increases was by posting for a job in a different department. They now say they offer a flexible hybrid work schedule but it’s mandatory to work in office 4x per week. 
USAA,"Design Educator, Facilitator & Coach",4,"It's a great place to work where you can find amazingly kind people. In terms of creativity and technology, they have some distance to go still. They care deeply about their members so I think that will serve them well into the future."
USAA,Customer Service Representative,3,"The job itself comes across as easy but evidently there’s always gonna be tights suits that expect you to memorize everything when they claim they don’t expect you to. Even when you do a good job it gets overshadowed by the constant nagging about what you didn’t do. Even if you k own what you’re doing you’re still expected to read a script like a robot. Overall,I love Foundever for their rehire process but USAA isn’t a reliable Line of Business especially when you have people micromanaging you like your days are numbered. "
USAA,Claims Processor,1,"This was a hostile work environment.  Management threaten you everyday  about your job.  You have to wait almost daily to get into the secure room, because management is not on time."
USAA,Insurance Agent,3,When I started it was great but then things changed with the leadership change at the top. Benefits reduced and sales metrics are a lot more stressful then when I first started. 
USAA,Insurance Agent,2,"Pros: decent pay, work from home, lots of training, breaks are often Cons: company practices anger members who call in to take it out on you, work from home is not flexible and you can get fired for having your kid be heard on a call, there are limited resources for helping members, and after training they toss you into calls with minimal practice. Breaks are too short. "
USAA,Customer Service Representative,2,"Good company as far benefits, onsite clinic and gym. Training was underwhelming for it to be a big company. Metrics are unbearable which makes for high turn over."
USAA,Consultant,2,Used to be a great place to work before they grew beyond their means. They're leadership and culture is stagnant and they refuse to adapt to the current climate of the market and industry. They will cut workers in a second to add a few extra thousand to their own salaries.
USAA,Senior Claims Adjuster,4,Sorry I left. Best job and co-workers I have ever had. Benefits including 401k contributions were top notch.  I always felt like the customer came first NOT the company and to me that was NOT the usual especially in insurance.
USAA,Data Engineer I,4,"USAA was probably one of my favorite places I've ever worked, but the layoffs in 2022 were pretty unexpected and harsh. USAA's definitely a place you can stay at for a while to grow your career and find mentoring, although it's definitely aging tech stack for most of the COSAs' DE teams, and you probably won't touch many tools for the first few years, since you're a small cog in the machine."
USAA,Claims examiner ,5,We own our own files which makes it easier.  We no longer have overflow calls and we have time to properly investigate.  I would recommend this company 
USAA,Customer Support Representative II,5,"Great typical work day, no system issues and role specific was awesome to learn during training. Very professional and supporting leadership team. Access to Starbucks! "
USAA,Insurance Agent,4,"I enjoyed working for USAA, strong sense of purpose, good pay, great benefits. The amount of training was sufficient to get you ready for the role. Highly recommend "
USAA,Licensed Insurance Agent,4,I enjoy most of my job as does anyone in customer service. The job can test your patience and be stressful but the coworkers and management make it easier. In my experience you have to be able to let the negative slide or else it will eat you up.
USAA,Banking Specialist,3,Non stop calls back to back. Micromanaged. They have decent benefits and large amount of PTO offered. You do get trained for weeks but once you get on phones you still don't know enough.
USAA,Director,4,This company has an outs mission and I was happy to be part of fulfilling it. Work/life balance was not balanced. Very good benefits. Some great people. 
USAA,IP Specialist,3,"Your circle of influence will get you far at usaa if you are good at being a leader and persuading or uplifting others. They expect you to do this whether you work in the call center like me or a more prestigious job title. I personally don't like most of my teammates due to their immaturity and negativity.. also talking behind my back, sucking uo to the boss by taking ny info and spinning it so they look better etc.. I wish I had a different teamm.. because of them my relationship with my boss has been skewed and it's led to me isolating to focus on just doing my daily job tasks like hitting metrics. It can be fulfilling if you're better with people than me.. I don't think I'm terrible but I just haven't been successful in that realm while employed here.. and I have found it easily in other workplaces so take it as you will. The members cam be pleasant to tall to but sometimes can also be very upset or low patience and the quotes are lengthy so they require patience for it to be worthwhile. I was a part of the military affairs team.. it took me a year and a half to two years from the time I expressed interest till having the opportunity .. it was a long wait and I've only had one opportunity to deploy in my 4 years.. I wish they were more frequent since that is arguably the most rewarding of all my time at usaa "
USAA,Insurance Professional,5,"Great boss, excellent benefits, company truly wanted the best for it's employees and customers. Workplace culture is very positive, you are treated like and adult (and that includes accountability).   For me the hardest part was that my role in sales was really not a fit for me.  "
USAA,Project/Program Manager,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Lots of different areas in banking operations and compliance to get experience inWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?A a contractor , getting stuck working in areas that don't align with  your career interests ro past work resume, due to organizational movement/staffing  needs."
USAA,Licensed Insurance Professional,5,"USAA has a strong workplace culture and goes above and beyond to help their employees succeed. This company has high expectations of its employees, but the return and benefits and support are well worth it. "
USAA,Injury Claims Adjuster,2,"As an injury adjuster was in charge of close to 500 claims. They are severely understaffed in this department so their expectations for the adjusters are unattainable. Managers love telling us, ""maybe this isnt the job for you"". The benefits there are awesome, but at what cost? The stress levels are high. If you are out sick or take vacation days then you know you will pay for it when you get back. This used to be the place to work at but not anymore. USAA had promised work from home after covid then changed their minds and made us return to office. Your job will be in jeopardy if you have long term illnesses, they will get rid of you. And will also get rid of you regardless how long you have been there. Company loyalty doesn't matter to them. You will be put on write up so that you do not receive a raise."
USAA,MSR,4,Call centers are definitely not my cup of tea but USAA does everything they can to support their MSRs plus you get multiple bonuses throughout the year!
USAA,"Design Educator, Facilitator & Coach",4,"It's a great place to work where you can find amazingly kind people. In terms of creativity and technology, they have some distance to go still. They care deeply about their members so I think that will serve them well into the future."
USAA,Insurance Agent,2,"The upselling while also trying to help people is insane. They make you fabricate ""opportunities"" to better sell things to people like the valuable personal properties policies. "
USAA,EDD Compliance Analyst,1,"I did not enjoy working here. Leaders and decisions appear to be made by blindfolded drawings out of a hat. Mandatory RTO, constant threat of layoff, and ever increasing pressure/expectations becomes a recipe for your new anxiety disorder. Maybe you will have a better experience than I did."
USAA,Senior Specialist,4,"Great company to work for and awesome benefits. It is a great learning experience and tons of skills you can quickly acquire. At the end of the day, it is what you make of it."
USAA,Insurance Agent,3,"This is a fast paced work environment with no time to breathe in between. It’s mentally draining at times with very short lunches (35 minutes). If you place yourself in Aux or put the member on hold for 1 minute, a senior will slack you & tag your manager “I’ve noticed you’ve been in aux, Is there anything I can do to help?” If we weren’t micromanaged before this just drops the ball. It’s not about how we can protect the military & their family they try to say that but at the end of the day it’s about how much you sold in every call. If they made the metrics realistic, gave the option for 1 hour lunches, cut down the micromanaging & increase the pay since we don’t get commission then I’m sure a lot of us would be happy. My takeaways are they taught me the art of salesmanship, the benefits are good & USAA is a reputable company so I’m sure if I looked elsewhere they’ll hire me in a heartbeat. "
USAA,Business Analyst,5,"My time at USAA was good for the most part. Good pay, good benefits. I think overall experience can be based on the leader you have. I had a great director as my main leader once you get above your direct supervisor it seems like there is a lot of politics at play. "
USAA,Insurance Member Relationship Specialist I / Acquisition and Retention,2,What is the best part of working at the company?After 17+ years of loyalty to the company it was either I resign or lose my job because I wasn't meeting one Stat while exceeding in all other areas. At this point it's all based on what you can sell. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Always having to worry about making your numbers or getting put on an Improvement plan and losing your bonus.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Had to take leave due to stress and anxiety and depression from job.
USAA,Senior Software Engineer,4,"Pros:- Great place to work, company mission and culture. - Company invests in cutting edge techs and tools.Cons:- New RTO (Return To Office) policy ruined everything. Mandatory 4 days a week if you live within 60 miles."
USAA,Project Manager,4,Great place to work. Good work life balance and benefits. The office space is nice and modern. Great leaders in management and great employees to work with. 
USAA,Auto Claims Adjuster,3,"So far it’s Ok. Impossible expectations and claims load. If you proceed, do so with caution and don’t believe a word you hear in NEO and training because it all changes during nesting. No standard management practices in place. They do what they want and play favorites. It’s great to learn what adjusters do so you can use them as a stepping stone for your adjuster career. You find out quickly why they lose so many people. If you view it as nothing more than a paycheck, you’ll do fine. Don’t look for any kind of support other than “did you look it up”?"
USAA,Auto Claims Adjuster,5," The stress level for a claims adjuster is extremely high. Although we are constantly told there are support systems in place, accessing support can be difficult. The claims adjuster training was awesome as it pertains to understanding the subject matter. The training in utilizing the claims management system (guidewire) was very limited. The number of claims we are assigned is overwhelming.  Managers are worried about meeting call metrics, not really the member's experiences or supporting the adjuster.  The managers will listen to your calls and critique them, and document your progress.  You have to pay attention not just to your work, but also to Slack chats all day. Eventually you can move up if you can hang in there and get through the stress of learning the ropes. As long as you don't care too much, you can get through it. The benefits are really good, so I guess it depends on how bad you need the job. Overall, I would not recommend this position to any of my friends. "
USAA,Insurance Professional,1,You’re on a timer and micromanaged every moment of everyday. Even the log out has a timer. You are constantly harassed about how many polices you issue and they will not pay you a dime in commission. They say they care and the koolaid is great. It’s a trap. It’s a call center and you will be expendable. 
USAA,"Director,  Enterprise Compliance and Operations Risk Testing",1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Working to develop a SLOD group to assess an effective risk management function.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Leadership is immature and weak on risk management and compliance functions. Always fighting for budget.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Poor, weak leadership, poor budgeting and technology needed to implement solutions.What is a typical day like for you at the company?12 hour days to get stuff done as you meetings for most of the days."
USAA,Insurance specialist ,5,Good Benefits. Stressful environment on phone. IT says its primarily  customer service but all they want are sales. Overall good company. Would work there again in a different role 
USAA,Claims Adjuster,1,"There is absolutely a reason that USAA  has a high rate of turnaround with staff and managers. New employees do not get the training needed in order to do the job correctly. Employees that cheat and lie to get through their work are often rewarded and sent on to the next level. Many times the managers seem irritated that they have to help you , yet you have no idea what you're doing. While going through the 3-day hype you up training session at the beginning of your employment journey it will make you think it's going to be the best job you've ever had in your life. Then once you actually do the work you will notice there is no support and management will put you down constantly telling you you're not good enough and making you feel as though you're a horrible human being.  It's like you don't matter to at all and you're just a number.  Management will state to you ""this may not be the right job fit for you""... which means you should quit before we fire you."
USAA,Member Solutions Associate,3,Heavy calls and stressful but can make for a good career if you can tolerate it. Company is supportive and provides good training. The facility is quite large which means it can take a while to get anywhere.
USAA,Auto Claims Adjuster,5,"Great buildings, both locations offer amazing amenities, including a full gym and cafeteria with cooks that make the food right in front of you. The training is great and prepare you for the workload. "
USAA,"Information Security Regulatory Compliance Consultant, Info Sec SLOD Team",5,"What is the best part of working at the company?I enjoyed the cross-functional Team collaboration among the various business units and the transparency of Directors and the Senior Leadership Team.  The willingness of the cross-functional teams and IT working together to remediate and minimize the risk landscape was very impressive.  Everyone came together and worked strategically for common purposes and goals.  It's an amazing atmosphere when others are proactive and goal-oriented as you are.  I enjoyed the time I worked there.  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The atmosphere at USAA was not stressful to me unless I ran into a teammate or someone who complained about existing obstacles instead of presenting practical recommendations for improvement or resolution.  You know..., those non-strategic nor critical thinkers.  Other than that, an assignment can become stressful if everyone does not pull their own weight.  What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Collaborative and progressive.  Culture was somewhat business professional mostly, but majority of the time it's a friendly and welcoming open-door environment.  What is a typical day like for you at the company?A typical day would consist of ongoing support and continuous oversight of existing processes with status or goal setting meetings throughout the day.  Time Management and People/Stakeholder Management is important and document, document, and document everything to ensure you are successfully achieving management's goals.  You never know when you may have to - more..."
USAA,Insurance Specialist,2,They are very strict on clocking out for 15 minutes for break and 40 minutes for lunch. Not a minute over. Worried when you are not on the phone- almost taboo if you don’t go to the bathroom on one of your breaks. 
USAA,Claims Adjuster,1,The work environment was toxic and with little training the set you loose with little oversight. As a brand new adjuster your expected to handle 20-30 new claims a day. You will never be able to catch up or take care of members like you are supposed to.
USAA,Customer Service Representative,5,"You will work, but this is a great place to get a foot in the insurance industry. Management will empower you with the toolset to change your life. I would recommend "

3M,General Operative,4,Long hours but good money and benefits.Great canteen and fun social nights.Offers different shift cycles with some on/off days.Overtime available and no weekends
3M,Assembler,3,"It's better if you're a full-time worker.If you're a temp, the chances of you becoming full-time (Hired) are slim. The work environment is easy-going and stress-free though. Temps, don't get any benefits and no PTOs or so I've heard and their pay is a lot lower than a full-time worker. I was fortunate enough to be a full-time worker, but I sympathize with the temps. "
3M,Mixer Operator,5,"Long shift. Hard work, You will start off as a general helper either in the coloring department or the crushing and screening department. From there you'll be doing irrelevant work to see if you want to stick around however if you make it through the first 6 months of probation you'll have a little more wiggle room as far as attendance points.                                                                                                                                ."

3M,Maschinen- und Anlagenführer,4,"You can earn good money, the work in Vollkonti is preferred.Working atmosphere among colleagues is good.Some superiors would like more."
3M,UX Designer,3,"Overall I enjoyed my time here, my managers were fine and I really liked my coworkers. The projects we worked on were interesting enough without being too stressful. My negatives come in once you realize that none of your managers will ever care about advocating for you or fight for you to get you to that next level. You will likely never get a promotion or a raise. There is nowhere to really grow as a UX Designer unless you want to become a MarTech Manager or a Product Owner - both of which have nothing to do with design at a company of this size. The best thing you to make more money is leave for two years and then come back when the cost of living salary adjustment has been brought up because they have more money in the budget for new hires than they do for giving current employees raises. "
3M,Process Operator,3,What is the best part of working at the company?The coworkers met some realy good people and learned a lot from them What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management  doesn't listen to the opinions of the employees.  They make changes even when employees have valid points on why it wont work and will make the task harder even when there are better ways of doing it. Plus a lot of favoritism family and frinds are given jobs over more deserving workers. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Family life is not taken into consideration What is a typical day like for you at the company?Demanding  not everyone is held to the same standard of work

3M,Production Operator,1,"7, 12 hour days in a row is crazy. They can make you work. 13 straight off for 1 and 13 straight again. And the job is simple but to much overtime and not enough time to myself "
3M,Machine operator,2,"Worked here for 3 years. Company has changed work hours from 12 hrs 3 to 4 days a weeks to 5 straight 8's, 4 times in 12 years. Overall pay is average. However production volume has slowed so much they do not offer overtime. I honestly woukdnt be surprised if they sell this buisness in 5 years or less. Demands for post-it notes are going down drastically. Management in specialty areas is especially bad. "
3M,Production Operator,1,"Management at 3M is terrible. The pay is good, but not worth the stress that comes with it. There's no room for advancement, unless you're part of the management click. I would not recommend 3M to ANYBODY. "
3M,Supply Chain Manager,4,"I worked a quarter century for 3M and I cannot express how special 3M is.  I worked alongside absolutely brilliant people and as near of a family environment as a public company could offer.   Unfortunately some of the 'family' atmosphere has eroded over time with more and more frequent layoffs.  While I find this heartbreaking, I can say that 3M is still a very good place to work and I would gladly accept a position if offered.   At the end of the day, I really enjoyed working with good people and appreciate the opportunity to learn from the brilliant employees."
3M,Jerry,5,"My opinion is that a new hire would assimilate with the workforce to learn how the operation is at its norm so as to ensure satisfaction and enjoyable with the work that is to be accomplished.In addition, new hires should quickly feel that they are important so as to ensure that the company share supports for the future benefit for the ""Long Haul."""

3M,Maitenance Technician,1,"I'm here to give advice to future Employees. Make sure you ask every question you will ever have about your position when your at the interview. I would recommend  writing  them down .Once you are offered the job the person you will be dealing with will not have a answerers to even the most basic questions. her go to answer is, "" I would not know that""   or you will find that out in orientations. it took me a month just to get the answerer to how many hours i would be working in pay period, i had to ask that because this person was un able to tell me my salary . Four months later and I still have never gotten answers that i have asked. ""work schedule ,holiday pay, sick pay,,,, I was asked to come to the plant for a tour and meet & greet. I flew in from another state for this. The same person that will be dealing with, informed me she knows nothing of this and they don't do that. needless to say i flew back with this not happening.       This has been the worst hiring Experience  have ever had in my carrier.       Everyone else i have Dealt with  has been Great.    It comes down to one person to ruin any potential quality employees you could have had....    "

3M,Marketing Manager,3,"I started working at 3M in 2014 . I went from loving my job to hating it. The management is just horrible and there is no appreciation for it's employees. Massive cuts are the norm every 6 months now. They've eliminated thousands of jobs in a span of a few years but the amount of work only increases and falls on those poor souls that are still left. If you're in Canada, you're treated like garbage by the head office and never given any advancement opportunities regardless of talent or performance. "

Innovative departments.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?All departments are not created equal.  There is so much training and growth which is amazing but you have to choose carefully to ensure you land an environment that is a good fit for you.Frequent re-organization which restructures operations and policies.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It varies from progressive to restrictive.  You have to ensure you know what works for you.   Parts of the organization resist change while other groups embrace it.The people are friendly, supportive, and always bringing in better ways to work and communicate.  Again, you can also land in extremely conservative group that resists change."
3M,Cutter,1,They act like they care about saftey. But upper management and hr are no existent.  Only care about paycheck and doing bare minimum. Hr will not help you with any hr issues. Upper management put no effort to even learn the process.

3M,Laboratory Technician I,2,"If you're looking for a job with friendly management and no office politics, then apply elsewhere. The engineers I worked with always seemed less than thrilled to answer questions about clarification and assignments of tasks. During slow periods, which happened more often than not, I would be passive-aggressively talked down to about not volunteering to do work outside of my job spec. Anyone with the skills to take on this position should instead apply somewhere else where you will be valued and appreciated. "

The company is well-known for its innovation and commitment to quality, and that was evident in the day-to-day operations. The work environment was fast-paced, with a strong emphasis on efficiency and safety. 3M takes their safety protocols very seriously, which made me feel comfortable and well-protected during my time there.The factory I worked at produced a variety of products, so there was always something new to learn. The training was thorough, and there were plenty of opportunities to ask questions and get hands-on experience with different machines. The management team was supportive, ensuring that everyone on the floor understood their roles and responsibilities.Teamwork was a key part of the job. The culture emphasized collaboration and communication, and we regularly had meetings to discuss production goals and any issues we were facing. While the work could be physically demanding at times, there was a strong sense of accomplishment when meeting production targets.Overall, 3M is a great place to work if you're looking for a structured, safety-focused environment with opportunities for skill development and career growth."

Haven’t had a new idea in decades…… the manager is lost …..They hire machinist to rework welded parts end of story …… but they make such a big deal out of nothing that no one could ever fit in there ….. so go interview if you need a good laugh …… the simplest job in the world and they try to make you believe how difficult it is cause they haven’t had a original idea there in decade’s….. and they think it’s so special when in reality it’s a low skilled job And they couldn’t get a job sweeping floors in a real machine shop ….

3M,Line lead,2,"This could be a very good place to work and while it was for a couple months the truth was revealed. I believe this is completely isolated to the clinton site. A typical day of work for me is not enough operators to even run the line, supervisors do not have your back no matter how much they claim they will, very rude management (if you even see them), little to no support, you have to tell maintenence the exact problem to get anything fixed (bandaided), the engineering team does way less than that. The pay would be ok if you were just doing your job, but you're not, it ends up begin everyones job you're doing because there isn't enough training staff. All decisions on the shop floor are trusted to one person who is very naive and inexperienced when it comes to people. We have forced(no notice) OT and forced time off. If you can't come in on a forced OT day you get pointed. If you don't use your vaca time you don't get paid for forced time off. There is absolutely no advancement for anyone that shows potential. There is a lot of blind blaming and lie believing. Noooooo communication and anyone that could help in any situation is completely detached from everything on the ship floor. This place is tragic because it really could be a good place. "

3M,Job trainer,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Do not work here.  Management plays favorites and treats us like kids. Making ridiculous rules and write people up for bogus things. Not a good place to work at. New people make almost the same as people who have worked there for 10+ years. You're just a number cause it's a big company and they just want the product out the door any way possible.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?All of it.  Not worth it go work here.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Not pleasant. Dread going here every day

3M,auxiliar de produção,5,"Company that makes payments on time, has some great benefits, just has no VA and VR, but meals are great.Leadership and team always well aligned.To excessive heat, lack of growth opportunity for having several old employees."

3M,Manufacturing Associate,3,"In my opinion, the employment at 3M was exciting in that there was innovative manufacture process that was to be learned. As part of the observation factor, I became aware of how much of the workplace seem animate. "
3M,Marketing Specialist,4,"Benefits are not bad, work-life balance is overall good, but the management culture can be really aggressive. A lot of typical corporate nonsense and office politics to deal with."
3M,Slitter Operator,3,"I will preface this review by saying I enjoy my job, and feel grateful to be employed by the company. I am compensated well for the job I perform with great pay and benefits. Pros: I enjoy every single person I work with on a daily basis, get along well with everyone and many are great people. The work you are tasked with is fairly easy to do, once you become more and more experienced. Overtime is paid time and a half, with Sundays being double time3 Weeks paid vacation, personal holidays, caregiver leave for patents401(k) Match and Stock purchase programCons:Overtime can and will be forced, not voluntary. Get your number up or you will be forced to work often when you may have other things going on. Management/supervisory team is absolutely horrendous. Some supervisors tend to spend a majority of the time hiding in the office, only really approach you when you’ve done something wrong. These people tend to be unapproachable and have bad people/communication skills. Training programs are unclear and don’t have specific goals/tasks that should be learned before being certified. You will be allowed to certify even if you aren’t ready/capable of the job if you desire to be. Employees are almost encouraged to perform sub optimally, as there is no recognition for doing great and very little penalty for doing poorly. Rotating schedule can be grueling "
3M,Customer Service Representative,3,"The work environment was very good, but employees are a number in a multinational giant.With the company's “face” process, they destroyed many jobs leaving great professionals outside."
3M,Production Operator,1,"Do not go to 3M if you want to have a work/life balance. On days off you will be drafted to come to work and if you don't you will receive a write up/ points. If you ask to be accommodated they will tell you that you knew what you signed up for. If something happens to the line while you're on break, tough titmouse, now you gotta stop eating your lunch n go help out! And if you don't help then you get written up because you wanted to enjoy your lunch. The only good thing about working at 3M is the money but you never have time to spend it."
3M,Production Assembler and Inspection,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The pay, and benefits are great.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The leads and some supervisors need to take leadership classes, and some leads are very jealous of employees and do whatever they can to get them terminated. 1 minute late adds up, and before you know it, you are being written up and or terminated. Finding somewhere to park can cause you to be late, so arrive very early. Don't trust the supervisors or leads. This company does not have your best interest at heart. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Not a very good work environment. Stressful.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful and rushed, leading to unforgivable mistakes that can get you terminated. Some departments have excellent trainers, and some teach you the bare minimum. You learn more through errors."

3M,Production Worker,1,"You will have no life and be treated like a dog by those in the 3M ""Good Old Boys Club"". Lots of silly and unnecessary rules, 3M claims safety is number one but it's not numbers and output are number one with no care about production workers. Pay is not that good any more as places like gas stations are catching up with our pay but 3M will give you a nickel and think they are doing you a favor. Managment needs to be flushed and new hired. Will be leaving soon to find a better place and a better life."

3M,Production Worker,1,"Unless you are management, they don’t care about you. They only care about putting out numbers.  This place also makes you work way too much overtime it is ridiculous. Pay is decent, but you hardly get to have personal life. Some co-workers are great, and are the only thing that make your shift bearable. "
3M,Robot Operator,5,Great hours (when working an actual schedule) the work was NOT back breaking but a lot of walking. Able to learn a lot and move up in the company. Not a bad company.
3M,servicio al cliente,5,"The best place to work.It is a lot of work but very well paid and excellent benefits higher than the law, the possibility of salary increase"
3M,Chemical Operator,3,Use to be a great place to work. Good pay and average benefits. Since Covid a lot of shutdowns and layoffs. They take safety seriously. But unless you have been there for 20 yrs you will get laid off
3M,Machine Operator,5,What is the best part of working at the company?They actually care about their employees What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The 12 hours but you’ll get use to it after 2 weeks inWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Cool and laid back as long as you do your workWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Enjoyable work environment everyone speaks and nice
3M,Operator,5,Work with the best coworkers money can Buy! always good team players always honest. never talk behind you back and act like nothing happened just a really great Dynamic!
3M,Taguig City,5,Good compensation package and work setup is hybrid but can be full remote.Has a lot of wellneas programs. Has good rewards and recognition.HR processes should be improved. Too slow in processing employee's issues and inquiries.
3M,Forklift Operator,2,"When I first started 3M over 5 years ago it was a great place to work, good benefits, realistic expectations, and good safety measures in place. Now none of that is applicable, they don’t care about your safety or how to make things work better. They only care about how much and how fast they can get product out of the doors."
3M,Production Worker,1,"Every day starts off with depression, anxiety, and fist clenching anger as I approach the entrance of the building. The reason you have those feelings is because you are a slave to 3M as soon as they hire you. You are extremely overworked and upper management has little to no care about your work life balance or mental health. Supervisors have no issues making you work every other weekend and putting 12 hour shifts on you in the middle of the week because overtime does not exist to them, even though production workers are more important than the higher ups. I have a family, 5 children and a beautiful spouse who love spending time with me. Sad for them that I work at 3M. Somedays I leave feeling less than human. The hardest part is supervisors and upper management could care less about your opinion. The best part is literally the one co-worker you make as your best friend."
3M,Technician,5,"friendly work environment and nice colleagues, decent pay and benefits package, good work and life balance, supportive management, supportive coworkers"
3M,Senior Collections Analyst,5,A great company I was able to learned a lot during my 5 years. You have to work hard and do things right if you want to grow! Hard to find good companies in general like this

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?No accountability for people. Blanket answers to issues. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Relaxed and climate controlled. What is a typical day like for you at the company?If it were any better I would worry that I would have to pay to go there.
3M,Insurance Verification Specialist,3,"The job overall was ok but it was beyond stressful every day with the amount of work expected to be completed daily. And if by any chance you were able to complete it, you still had more orders that coworkers would need help with. It just never felt like you ever left, mind was always on what you needed to do when you clocked back in."
3M,Production operator ,1,It sucks because the pay here is great for the work but management is very toxic. Most coworkers are ok but some very toxic. Pretty much favorites of management so it creates an overall toxic environment. Blatant favoritism that no one ( even corporate) does anything about

Exelon,Associate Engineer,3,Work is slow and onboarding process is very bad. It is hard to understand what the expectation is and doesn’t seem like development is. Not a great place to be while you are young
Exelon,Director,2,"Exelon has always been a stand out on DEI and culture. However, new senior leaders are now in place that only give this lip service. It is no longer a safe place of acceptance. This is likely due to the stress senior leaders are under to perform to wall street's expectations. Separation from the non-regulated side (Now Constellation) has unmasked how poorly the T&D business was operating from a financial perspective. This has caused a light to shine in areas it never had and now McKinsey is leading a major initiative to make improvements to the business. This has caused leaders to abandon some of the closely held values and start leading based on fear instead of what used to be camaraderie.  "
Exelon,Agile Scrum Master,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Team collaboration and leadership of real people with hearts. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?All projects are stressful and impediments contribute to this but at Exelon it's the positive attitude of the teams that move you forward.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?Meetings, solution solving and delivery."
Exelon,Senior Data Management Analyst,5,"I started as a contractor and later converted to full-time after two years. I must admit that as a contractor, I accomplished a lot. After converting, I spent more time in meetings than compared to doing reporting and visualization. Part of it may have been due to the pandemic and people hankering for personal communication while they were on lockdown. It was a very nice company to work at and I was grateful to get exposed to Power BI and Salesforce."

Exelon,Finance Manager,5,Great people and good benefits. Company is going through some hard times with the ICC and regulatory bodies disallowing budgets. On call for 24 hr storm duty restoration is something to be aware of as it is required of management employees 
Exelon,Principal Project Manager,3,"Political Long hours, travel may be required.Advancement depends on your manager and their willingness to train and promote, so often not best candidate.Salary rankings political, same favorite group at top."
Exelon,Manager,4,"Pros- Interesting, challenging, and important  work at least if you’re working directly on energy transition type issues- Competitive pay and benefits compared to peers- Financial stability due to being a large utility-  Company and management prioritize career development and growth, with ample opportunity to move around and grow into different areasCons- Corporate bureaucracy and inertia associated with large size and a very traditional hierarchical org structure- Hybrid work policy requiring employees to be in the office weekly and located near an office. Remote was working — you’re hurting your own talent pool and driving turnover- Most won’t care but if you’re interested in the energy transition this might disappoint you. Senior leadership can feel visionless. There’s a states vision to lead the energy transformation but limited action and effort from the very top to make any bold moves. They seem more focused on PR and rate case outcomes than actually developing a coherent strategy “lead the energy transformation” means"
Exelon,Nuclear Armed Security Officer,4,Training is some of the best and the experience surreal. There is no micromanaging and down time allows one to further their career if interested but many make a career out of doing security. Shift work can feel long at times. I wouldn't have left but thought the plant was closing. I would recommend this location.
Exelon,General Engineer,4,Depending on your department the work culture can be extremely dry. They are more interested in participating in outreach than completing actual work for those in office positions 
Exelon,IT Manager,4,"Great place to work. Learned a lot.  Good people to work with.  Spend time making sure everyone was trained,  put a huge priority on safety.  Very big and diverse."
Exelon,Manger,4,Lots of favoritism when it comes to being promoted or getting selected to interview for other jobs. If your department doesn’t want to hire they will hold you back to avoid it.

Exelon,Wintel Hosting Operations Analyst/Server Management (Contract),5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The company culture and opportunities to learn were what I enjoyed most. I enjoyed my time with this company and the people I worked with and learned with. Everyone was always willing to help teach each other and close any gaps in the team. Management was also responsive and was always looking for ways to train, promote, and improve their team.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The most stressful part was the tight deadlines when infrastructure systems went down but it was welcomed stress. Additionally, management cross-trained their team so that the work is evenly distributed and there are always resources available when deadlines are extremely short. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?If you are like me and love learning new technologies you will love it there. They also have a very inclusive company culture and you get to meet people from all walks of life and learn from their experiences. They also have networking events for different groups of people.

Their products are always ahead of the curve, showcasing a commitment to staying cutting-edge."""
Exelon,Sr. Business Analyst,4,I have worked in both PHI and BGE territory. Both companies are good and have great benefits. There is still about 50% of leadership that have a very old school mentality and you can tell they are only in their positions because they are subject matter experts but lack people skills and leading a team. Overall I would say it’s a good place to work and there’s plenty of opportunities to grow it’s just finding the right fit in the company. 
Exelon,magazijnier/heftruckchauffeur,1,No follow -up of the employees is left to your fate Many harassment cord evaluation of questions asked you will not get an answer summary summarized very bad employer

Exelon,Senior Category Manager,1,Good company but has a non-trusting management so you spend much time explaining/justifying all your decisions up the chain of command. This severely impedes everone's productivity at all levels

Exelon,Analyst of Audit Services,4,"The benefits are great. The pay is great. Work life balance was satisfactory for our department. I was able to take parental leave without any disruption. Management does care about its people and their growth. I enjoyed working with the people on my team. I did try to get promoted once, and tried to make a lateral move once.

Exelon,Instrument Maintenance First Line Supervisor,4,"Exelon Generation, now Constellation, was my first job out of the Navy.  It is a demanding job, but also fulfilling.  The people there are some of the best that I have worked with.  This almost offsets the high demand and impact on your home life.  The company provides a lot of employee benefits that others are phasing out, personal holidays, sick time, PTO, its pretty good.  Now that I'm gone I see that their benefits package is up there with the best.  However, that is because the job is demanding and requires such support and programs. The goal will always be to keep the turbine spinning.  That's your job.  That will never change.  I'd recommend this job and company to anyone as long as they understand that there is a chunk of your life that will also go towards the company.  It wasn't for me, but it is clearly something that others love to do and will make a fulfilling career of!"

Exelon,FP&A Manager,5,It is a great place to work at. Great company culture and great environment. Amazing opportunities to move up. There are different trainings that you can take to learn your material quicker. 
Exelon,Senior Program Manager,2,"Exelon is a company that to a large degree embraces how boring the utility industry thinks it has to be. There are a lot of great people doing great work, but if you're not in their silo, you're not doing that great work with them, and the status quo of not collaborating or moving the needle is A-okay to most people here. Innovation is mostly happening on the engineering and tech side of things, and even some policy work! But not so much anywhere else.Perhaps you're stuck on some endlessly cycling project that you have to manage. Or, maybe you were hired for one thing and one thing only, and good luck ever breaking out of that. It's not a workplace that particularly respects your intellect or your creativity. A lot of box-checking.Management is elusive and highly political. Advancement opportunities are few and far between if you're not part of the cool kids club. A lot of unspoken rules and backdoor maneuvers that people use to get ahead and trample each other in the process. "

Exelon,Supervisor,3,A lot of hard working people. Long hours which you are compensated for. This was a great experience for someone in the utility sector that no longer wants to travel.
Exelon,Intern,5,"Interned with at their PECO office this Summer. I learned so much and was compensated competitively for an internship. I will say, my manager was not very hands on, but towards the end of my internship I was given decent taskloads. "
Exelon,Senior Project Manager,5,team member stab you in the back.  Management work with you.  Too many processes. The overall company is a great place to work.  hopefully they will keep me employed
Exelon,Executive Administrative Assistant - Functions,3,You never know what’s going to come about. Great place for new electrical engineers. Used to be a place you knew you could stay forever. Now there’s lots of uncertainty.
Exelon,Manager,3,The benefits are second to none and the pay is also fantastic.  The support of management and human resources is awful though. Also the work life balance is all but nonexistent for some.
Exelon,Security Officer,3,"Don't even know where to start. This place has the worst management I have ever worked for. They do nothing to improve work life balance, or improve moral of the department. You hear the same regurgitated garbage over and over again about what needs improved, but it never gets done. The management will not go out of their way to help you. If you have issues, they blank stare listen and that's the end of the conversation. Security management will not bring up issues that other departments, because they know their management is a joke, and if they do bring up issues that are reported, it ruins their possible chance of moving to management in another department. If you like working with lazy management that pawns off as much work as possible on the guards, this is the job for you. Asking them to help you in anyway that involves them getting out of their chair is a dilemma.     For the training department, why even bother having one. Another big joke of security. If you want to sit around and talk about life stories and tell jokes for weeks, that's the place. The only place you learn anything is from on the job shadowing, but you don't get much of that. For the time wasted by instructors, who don't even know the full scope of the security job, they have the on staff security train them. It's all fine, but what is the point of the training department then?      I always wondered what other departments think of security management. Security is the bottom of the barrel department, that is told what to do by other departments. The security management has absolutely no backbone when - more..."
Exelon,Security Officer,3,"Pays well, but constantly rotation between days and nights, coupled with mandatory staffing needs, result in a poor work/life balance. High turnover rate results in a constant flow of overtime."
Exelon,Engineer,3,Not bad. Nuclear is for some and not for others. But overall it’s not bad place to work. I was remote 80-90% of the time. Depends on you manager if you can work remotley
Exelon,Business Analyst (Contractor),1,Terrible company to work for. No training which leads to unsuccessful projects. You are pretty much set for failure. Management never have any feedback and giving a try 
Exelon,Senior Supervisor Customer Care,4,Working under the Pepco banner prior to merger with Exelon was more a family atmosphere.  Under Exelon it was more trying to have 5 opco’s trying to act like one big company with. Ever location working the same.  Did not work and resulted in a talent loss.
Exelon,Security Officer,4,"Pays great, people suck. It seems some (most) people look down to the security department. Some move up, some move on, some stay because it's a relatively easy job, good benefits, but can be very boring and easily become complacent "
Exelon,Senior Chemist,3,"You are expected to be on call at all hours. Even if it is not your week to be on call, you have to make yourself available. I was told to my job comes first, and family second. Unacceptable. Management is also clueless to what goes on in the plant. You are expected to jump positions constantly. There were “chemists” who don’t even have degrees in science. No expertise whatsoever. "
Exelon,Senior Accountant,3,"I worked in the Accounting/Finance division at Exelon. The employees in this group do have opportunities to get promoted or make lateral moves within the organization if the individual stays long enough. However, work/life balance is poor and the work environment can be toxic and stressful (mainly due to management). Also, compensation is average but benefits are great. I would only recommend working here if you are very big on professional development and want to move up the corporate ladder relatively quickly and/or you like to stay busy all the time. Otherwise, the job isn't all that beneficial. "
Exelon,Armed Security Officer,3,You work all the time and don't have a life per your contract you will never get time off and when they call u in you have to come in or you get intouble or even fired.
Exelon,Senior Security Officer,3,"Not respected as an employee, if you are a hard worker they treat you like a dog. The work life balance is awful. Communication is awful on all levels."
Exelon,Consultant,3,"It’s a great place to work, people are good, good work culture. Pay benefits are not bad too, overall good company to work for, I would recommend that"
Exelon,Armed Security Officer,5,"The pay is pretty good downfall is possibly getting mandated to come in on day off. All 12hr days, alternating weekends. Management can be pretty fair.  Decent place to work. "
Exelon,Security,1,Zero work life balance... It just does not exist here and never will for security. No urgency to remove the pressure off the work force either. Management says the right things but never actually follows through.
Exelon,Auxiliary Operator,4,"Good pay but you will work weekends, nights, holidays, while similarly compensated support personelle work from home.  Don't trust management, ever.  The only real diversity is in security. All other departments could pass for a Jimmy Buffett concert, but somehow less entertaining"
Exelon,Sr. Mechanical Engineer,1,"If you work for Exelon, you will need all of the work preservation tools you can muster, or else, you will be out in the cold in short order.   Six sigma productivity gains are not painless.  No matter what the policy is, family and personal time can not take a priority over productivity.  The success of the company is job one, family second, and the community last (unless there is a tax or rate incentive adding to the bottom line, then it moves up to second place)."
Exelon,Associate Engineer,3,Work is slow and onboarding process is very bad. It is hard to understand what the expectation is and doesn’t seem like development is. Not a great place to be while you are young
Exelon,Customer Care Representative-temp,5,"The pay was great , the people are divided-union workers vs management is very apparent. The works all snitch on one another . The msnsgent will take things personal and as a temp just stay out the way. Your expendable at any time. temps are nothing until you cross over and you can be coached to succeed but temp strategy managers are not all the same. i regret not one moment working there but would not go back as temp -managers be in the feelings"
Exelon,Armed Security Officer,3,Lots of OT. No work life balance. Very repetitive job. Weak union. All required training takes place on days off. Good Pay. Very good benefits. 401K.   
Exelon,"Operator, Mechanic",1,I would not recommend the job to anyone if they have not changed their attitude toward new employees. I have never had a vacation cancelled until I worked for Exelon. I worked there about eleven years. It seemed like managers were removed from other plants to work there as punishment.  The biggest problem was the union representation. I was laid off twice when I should not have been since it was against the contract. Former Edison employees were given my job.  
Exelon,Instructor,2,"Pay is very good for the industry, however the culture and work life balance is very poor. Salaried individuals are routinely expected to work 15-20 plus hours of extra time each week and the organization is unwilling to adapt and change it’s management style with an increasingly younger workforce that is motivated by different things. In one year we lost 5 employees from my department alone and nothing was done to examine why except throwing retention bonuses at the current employees which required full reimbursement to the company no matter how much of the contract you had fulfilled. Also in 10 years never received a raise that even came close to inflation, therefore every year compensation was worth less and less. "
Exelon,Security,5,Exelon is a great company to work for. Many opportunities for advancement or relocation if you needed. Management understands employees concerns and works with you to correct issues. 
Exelon,Administrative Coordinator,5,"I have been welcomed with open arms!! I so enjoy working for Exelon!Supportive / Challenging/Professional/PositiveStaff fun, enjoyable to work with. Management are encouraging, supportive "
Exelon,Unknown,3,"Good pay and benefits but terrible work life balance if you are in engineering operations or maintenance. Rough company culture as well, management overworks"
Exelon,Business Analyst,3,It was extremely stressful. I was always stressed. Always more was expected and required. I felt trapped for a long time. What made matters worse was that the expectation was to train yourself.
Exelon,Non-Licensed Operator,3,Benefits and pay are great.  Downside would be getting a ton of radiation.  Its a union job so not much upward movement.  Plants are in the middle of nowhere.  Pay is great.
Exelon,Service Representative B,4,Good company over all good pay good benefits. Forced to join the union. Working from home during covid was great. . No max salary per position. Schedule bids every 6 months
Exelon,Equipment Operator,3,"Management was a mixed bag, I worked with some of the best and the worst people. I did learn a lot, the work was very engaging, but there was a lot of forced overtime. Lots of opportunities for advancement. "
Exelon,Equipment Operator,3,"Mismanagement of staffing lead to massive amounts of forced overtime, no quality of life, management never planned in advance for retirements or lateral moves out of the department."
Exelon,Security ,1,"You’ll be just a number here in the security department.  Management is horrible and can’t even schedule accordingly.  High turnover for a good paying job, what’s that tell you? "
Exelon,Business Development Specialist,4,I loved working at exelon. The people were always nice and helpful when I was working on long projects. The work life balance was great but has slow upward mobility and growth if you start at an entry level role and a minority.
Exelon,Equipment Operator,3,Working on a rotating shift schedule is hard because you work weekends and nights as well as holidays. It just depends on when you are scheduled to work. You get paid a decent amount so that helps compensate for the horrible hours.
Exelon,Staff Accountant,5,Exelon is an awesome company to work for. There are so many different ways to advance your career. You are always learning something new. The people I work with are very nice caring people. I enjoy working for them!
Exelon,Security Officer,3,"Union site, so you will likely have to work nights for at least couple of years until you gain enough seniority to dayshift. 12 hour shifts. If you like lots of overtime, you'll love it. If you value your personal time, you'll hate it."
Exelon,Senior Reactor Operator/Operations Shift Supervisor,2,"The expression ""do more with less"" is very common here.  Advancement quickly stops once you reach front line supervision.  Often told people that leave are weak and just want to smoke weed.  That is how senior leadership views the workers.   "
Exelon,Helper and progressed,5,A very good place to start a career I have met a lot of great and knowledgeable coworkers throughout my career with Exelon. Also great job security and lots of overtime.
Exelon,Engineering Intern,5,"During my time at Exelon, the team and management that I worked with were incredibly supportive and wanted me to succeed. They gave me the best and worst parts of the job to give me a truly authentic experience, and I greatly appreciate that."
Dollar General,Dollar General Sales Associate,5,The management was great and everyone was very kind. I have nothing negative to say about this amazing company! The work environment was great as well and the Job duties were very well organized.
Dollar General,Manager on Duty (MOD),1,They work you to death underappreciating and then cut your hours and think you're always stealingi went anytime they needed me stayed extra hours and didi everything they asked and still treated me like dirt
Dollar General,Cashier,1,I was just going day by day i really don't do much was stocking organizating then I was just was seeming like I was going start there long manager got replace to he gad me back and forth arrange the same shelf the tell me re do it again them. wasnt understandable wasn't the place I seen being for to long so I even up parting ways
Dollar General,Store Associate,1,What is the best part of working at the company?There is not anything good about working for this company What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The company expects 1 person to do the job of 3 peopleWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very bad working conditions due to over stocked and over crowded stores. Very rude and lazy managers and employees What is a typical day like for you at the company?The only thing I enjoyed about my day at work was the regular customer's that I got to see and conversate with
Dollar General,Store Manager,1,"Anyone above the store manager position doesn’t care about anything/anyone except keeping the store open.  They expect too much with the budget they provide with what seems to be the minimum pay.  There are no incentive programs to make employees WANT to stay, and there is nothing competitive about their pay.  The only reason I stayed for as long as I did was because of my customers and the fact the my staff was like an extended family instead of just tools to be used.  "
Dollar General,Cashier,1,One of the worst environments I’ve ever worked in. Very poor management and a lot of things being pushed under the table because of the way things are being ran .
Dollar General,Key Holder/Sales Associate,3,"It was alright, some employees just seemed to be there for themselves and their pockets. Some customers were really nice though. Not enough pay for the work that was done."
Dollar General,Sales Associate/Cashier,2,"A typical day at work consists of stocking counters, tilling items for customers, and cleaning. Typical tasks, but I'll get to the crux of the problem below, why I rated so low.The issue with this company is one that a lot of customer service companies face, but this company pays a lot less for it. They only ever keep two people on shift at a time. This means for the most part you can expect to be scrambling in-between tasks when the line gets long.At 7.75$ per hour? This is how they keep the prices low. You can do better than here. This is a decent resumé filler however."
Dollar General,Manager,1,"No one wants to work so you’re forced to do others jobs……….. it just absolutely sucks to work there, weight’s between the products can change from 10 pounds to 50, and you’re carrying it up and down stairs all day "
Dollar General,Driver/Operator,3,The pay was really good because the job was hard. You have to push the rooltainers weight over 1000 pounds. Very tough job. Some store managers are good but a lot are so meaan.
Dollar General,Key Holder,1,"There’s never enough hours for people and we are constantly getting yelled out by  upper management about going over hours. There’s not enough time in a shift to get everything done. You’re expected to help customers, check them out, stock, check in vendors, clean up isles, and put out new labels all while you’re by yourself or with one other person. Everything is old and needs to be replaced but they refuse to do anything about it. The only good thing about the job is weekly pay and the people I work with. I’m feeling overwhelmed and stressed over the job constantly."
Dollar General,Night Closing Manager,5,Working here is fun the staff is always chill and the team always helped each other we gave great customer service always made sure customers found what they were looking for!! Perfect team setting!! 
Dollar General,Assistant Manager,3,"The job is fine, but there aren't enough people to do what needs to be done. One person cant stock and run the cash register at the same time. And the person leaving before you always wants to call you in early. Everyday "
Dollar General,Lead Sales Associate/Key Holder,3,What is the best part of working at the company?Some of the people. Most stores are not organized well.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Managers and other employees who DON'T do their jobs.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Plenty of nice customers as well as hateful ones.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy and always something to do.
Dollar General,Store Manager,1,"The only way to thrive at DG as a manager is if you're willing to sacrifice all of your personal, family, social life for meager compensation returns and not a single thank you or recognition from corporate leadership. Excellent overtime opportunity for ASMs and under as stores are always struggling with bloated store inventory and training due to outrageous turnover centric around poor leaders. Inconsistent schedules supposedly based around business needs. Suggested schedules that are enforced strictly with no room for flexibility. Prepare to be berated for every little thing wrong on store walks with DM after your ""training"" and only offered hours to fill with unskilled labor assistance. No cohesiveness as a unit beyond the store level. Great opportunity for young single individuals with lack of experience in the workforce, but don't expect any flexibility when trying to set aside time with your family. You will consistently work 50-75 hours a week on salary as a store manager and will be expected to work overnight shifts outside of business hours to catch up on every task that falls behind regardless of reasoning. No overtime incentive for salaried managers and the pay is just barely enough to be worth it. If you're looking for some money in a pinch, I wouldn't recommend making a career with this company. You will constantly suffer with having to train people that may or may not stay more than a month (usually don't) and fall behind on tasks creating a snowball effect of issues when workflow becomes congested due to lack of skilled labor. Oh and if you want a break at all - more..."
Dollar General,Lead Sales Associate,1,They do not care about their employees. Only care about money. Worked there 9 months was supposed to see a raise a 6 months never got it. Come to find out sales associates are making the same about as I was as a keyholder. I was literally getting the same amount of pay as a sales associate and doing way way way more work. Don’t know how the company gets away with such acts. They should be ashamed no wonder they can’t get people to stay. 
Dollar General,Customer Service,1,"Honestly, I stayed here for two years and I never once got a raise. They don't really give you any discount as far as what's in the store. They don't really provide any food or drinks and they only ever had competition."
Dollar General,Store Manager,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Weekly pay is the best part of working at this company What is the most stressful part about working at the company?This company uses one person to do 5-person job. They will try to pay as little as possible. Overtime is definitely prohibited What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Horrible. Management treats you as a disposable object.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Overworked and underpaid. They expect you to do 10 rolltainers (placing items on the shelves), tend to customers, complete scans, do planogroms (update prices) hang tags etc etc with just maybe two people max on one 7 or 6 hour shift"
Dollar General,Dollar General Cashier,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Steady past job and set hours What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Wasn’t much stress at all for meWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great environment nice clean and safe place to me What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy and a lot of friendly people
Dollar General,Parttime Cashier Clerk,5,Opened registers making certain cash available for operational workday. Stocked merchandised as needed. Ensured all scanners functional. Rung up sales and bagged items. Applied security procedures throughout the store. Balanced money count at days end. Trained associates as required in all store directives. Management was always professional and friendly. Really enjoyed working with our clientele. great place to work!
Dollar General,Sales Associate Lead,1,"Usually there are only 2-3 people working at a time. If you are a keyholder you can get stuck working by yourself if someone doesn't show up, and you can't leave on your lunch break which will be interrupted because no one else has keys. I was called often on my days off and even after I quit. Very busy because there aren't many other stores in town. There is always stocking to do because there are no after-hours for it. Management was the worst I've met so far. They told me how they hated other employees in an explicit manner. They also trained me to do work that was for them to do, but I didn't get paid extra. Customers are known for being rude and stealing is very common."
Dollar General,Dollar General Sales Associate,5,The management was great and everyone was very kind. I have nothing negative to say about this amazing company! The work environment was great as well and the Job duties were very well organized.
Dollar General,Sales Accociate,1,Tried my best but the company barely paid us and kept changing the rules to punish us. Needed a manager to return or fix anything on register even though they were making them do 4 other jobs at once and you always had to call them up to the front and wait a long time. 
Dollar General,Picker,2,"It's a joke. Don't waste your time..Worst place I ever worked. Met some pretty cool people, but upper management was a joke. The position was given based solely on seniority. "
Dollar General,Cashier/Sales Associate,4,Not a bad place to work. Coworkers were great. Dollar General as a corporation doesn’t care about its employees but everyone already knows that. It’s a paycheck. 
Dollar General,Dollar General key holder/ lead sales associate ,2," The day starts at 7:30 am when you unlock the door. You then have 30 minutes to count all tills,start the registers,check the store for missed tasks from the night before. Do the paperwork and prepare for opening the door at 8am. Your there alone until around noon so going to the back to do anything is not permitted.  You run the register, help locate things for customers, stock shelves,  and check in vendors, process returns ect. ect. Once help finally gets clocked in you can go to the bathroom and then start your stock duties in the back. The stores only get so many hrs for payroll a week and not nearly enough to cover all the work that has to be done. They don't give pay increases to match the work load and they don't provide incentives to keep good employees motivated. "
Dollar General,Shift Leader,3,there are no enough employees per shift. we are closing most of the time with just 3 people and us 3 have to clean and organize all the store. no work life balance
Dollar General,Sales Associate,3,"Was fun and a easy work environment, pay is not worth working there. The hours were decent but randomly would drop, and there wasnt much to do after you've done the checklist so you would just stand around waiting for customers"
Dollar General,Cashier/Stocker/Sales Associate,3,Register is easy I like working  with people.The stocking can b confusing. The labels can b hard figure out where to  put stockStanding alone wears on feet legs and back. But I like helping people.
Dollar General,Store Manager,4,This company has great benefits and will help you if u are down and out. It's a very easy company to work for great people. Hardest part is no work life balance.
Dollar General,Cashier,4,The job is pretty easy and the people here are really nice. The work itself has little to no difficulty as you would expect from a cashier position. The pay isn’t that great though
Dollar General,Checker,1,What is the best part of working at the company?The paycheck is the best part What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The hours you have to work versus what they claim your hours are when hired.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It depends on who’s running the place because they’re always changing directors.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Long and tiring but my coworkers keep it interesting and bearable.
Dollar General,Cashier,1,Hated working here. no breaks with low pay. only 2 employees in the entire store. overworked and underpayed. Rude customers that cuss and swear at you.
Dollar General,Shift Leader,1,"My manager and my team have pushed ourselves time after time for a company that does not care for our Store Managers and their employees. We do our best to get the store together and we receive no help in doing so. We tell our company the things that we need to succeed and they pay us no mind. We have almost 4 freezers down and they send people in that do nothing to fix it. We need accessible doors for our elderly customer and still these go unaddressed. We also need new floors, ceiling tiles and working AC and again these requests are ignored. They don't care about us at all, they only care if we make them money. I am a Full-Time Shift Leader and I am still making Part-Time pay. Do Better."
Dollar General,Store Manager,4,I enjoy working at Dollar General. My district manager is awesome. He cares about his employees. I like the customer service aspect of the job but there is no work-life balance .
Dollar General,Cashier,1,This job is not about employees the pay is low and they don't care about you outside life with this job I really wish I never worked at this unprofessional place of work
Dollar General,Cashier,1,"My time working there was the most stressful time in my life. Underpaid, under staffed and beyond stressful. There wouldn't be a day, that I wouldn't be reprimanded for something not done. "
Dollar General,Sales Associate,2,They don’t pay you a lot and you don’t get many hours and the some coworkers are nice and some are not. It’s hard to live off what they are paying everybody.
Dollar General,Assistant Manager,4,Frustrating always keeping up with freight with lack of employees. Manager and other staff were nice. Customers frustrating at times but that’s retail.
Dollar General,Key Holder/Sales Associate,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?A small store compared to some of the bigger corporations.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?When prices doesn’t match or on sale items What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Not stressful or overwhelming. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Clock in, count till, log into register, operate register as needed, stock shelves, prepare for closing, count till, prepare deposit, close and lock up."
Dollar General,Store Manager,1,"The scare tactics the higher ups use can drive a staff to the brink of tears and exhaustion. They are expecting to cut payroll hours from full-time employees to give the sales associates for budget instead of just supplying the stores with hours, they are taking from shiftleads, specificly. The workload on the employees with no hours is unmanageable. I wouldn't recommend to anyone right now unless they make serious changes."
Dollar General,Sales Associate,1,Management sucks. Really high turn over rate and will over work you if given the chance. There’s barely any training on procedures and you’re expected to learn quickly or consequences will happen
Dollar General,Dollar General Sales Associate,5,The management was great and everyone was very kind. I have nothing negative to say about this amazing company! The work environment was great as well and the Job duties were very well organized.
Dollar General,Cashier/Stocker,1,That place ha ha  learn not trust learn they’d Stab ya in the back it’s a father daughter as manager and assistant talk about favoritism idk someone might think differently everyone has a right to there opinion 
Dollar General,Store Manager,1,No payroll so people work alone and they expect you to live there. There is no work/home balance. You are strictly there to make them billions of dollars and they don't care about you at all.
Dollar General,Order selector/Forklift Operator,2,They over work you if you learn how to do other jobs you can't say no or they will give you an attitude assessment. They're also never really honest with you about certain things. If management likes you they might help you get promotions otherwise they'll just hold you back  
Dollar General,Fleet Driver,4,"Good place to work, Great benefits, decent pay. Good atmosphere and good environment. Ok loads, two day runs. Home times vary. Dispatchers are transparent "
Dollar General,Key Holder,3,"Wasn't terrible but definitely better out there. Worked there for about 2 years in total in a couple of different locations. Don't expect them to care much about you. You're just there to let the other person go home. The company doesn't care about you in a slightest, they can replace you in a week. "
Dollar General,Store manager ,1,What is the best part of working at the company?No comment it's a job helps with billaWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Staff don't come to work you have to rush to get truck worked sometimes you can't take offWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Working is okay love my customers What is a typical day like for you at the company?Running aways don't have time to do office work
Dollar General,Non-Perishable Manager,1,Understaffing purposely and power hungry managers not once have they actually cared about who works for them. Doesn't care what you deal with or go through
Dollar General,Assistant Store Manager,1,Worked long hrs low pay and felt unappreciated by upper management. Worked alone at night closing store down . Hardest part was trying to find space to put up all shipments. Back rooms extremely packed and unorganized.
Dollar General,Dollar General Sales Associate,1,Nothing stands out. This is a evil company that cares nothing about. Its employees. They will put your lives at risk if it means they can save a dollar.
Dollar General,Store Manager,1,"As a manager it's salary and they pay you for 40 hours but you will be there for 60+ due to people calling out, quitting or the fact they don't give enough hours to schedule the people to be there during the week to run the store successfully open to close, with fully stocked shelves and no product left on the floor. It's horrible to work for them as a manger or any position unfortunately. "
Dollar General,Dollar General Lead Sales Associate,2,"Managers are nice and will tell you straight out that there isn’t much hope for significant raises anytime in the near future. It was almost a running joke! You will work really hard, get more responsibility and be promoted, but you will be lucky to get a .50 raise per hour after a year of working your tail off. "
Dollar General,Cashier,1,"the pay sucks, your left alone a lot, customers are rude, cashiers getting in trouble for standing at register if no customer is there for 5 seconds .."
Dollar General,Retail Sales Associate,3,Workplace culture I great customer service the most enjoyable part of working their is my customers. I love working their keeping my work . Productive. My work environment . Safe clean. 
Dollar General,Key Holder/Sales Associate,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Will never work for them again. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Pay, hours and too much stock for tiny storesWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?They don't care about their employees What is a typical day like for you at the company?Horrible place to work. The company doesn't care about employees"
Dollar General,Key Holder,3,"You have to be careful working there because they don’t have security and people come to steal and break in a lot of times the managers don’t care the pay is Lil for the job description of basically doing everything in the store like a manager, but getting paid the same amount as a cashier"
Dollar General,Manager ,5,It was always good and fast moving never had any issues. It was a really good job and a lot of people would love to work there. They teach what u need to know.
Dollar General,Cashier,5,Awesome supervisor light work. Coworkers are super friendly would definitely recommend this job.  Super convenient location and understanding when something comes up at my kids school . 
Dollar General,Assistant Manager,1,"If you want to move up quickly go ahead and work for dg, but otherwise stay away. They try to work you off the clock, and call you all hours of the day. Zero work life balance and corporate is completely terrible "
Dollar General,Key Holder/Sales Associate,2,"Working at Dollar General has been a challenging experience due to poor management and inconsistent scheduling. The store manager is frequently absent, leaving the team without proper leadership. As a part-time employee, my hours fluctuate drastically, sometimes working as few as 5 hours one week and over 40 hours the next. This lack of stability makes it difficult to plan my personal life.As a key holder, I often find myself taking on responsibilities that should fall to the store and assistant managers, yet I am only compensated for my role as a key holder. The district manager seems indifferent to these issues, failing to address the store manager’s absence and lack of adherence to company policies.Overall, the lack of support and recognition from upper management makes it hard to stay motivated and feel valued in this role. "
Dollar General,Full Time Key Holder,1,"Dollar general's policy and culture demonstrates a complete lack of appreciation, productivity, career advancement, and care of its employees. They treat the employees as if their needs are invalid and they are easily replaceable. If you rub management the wrong way, your hours are cut and your eventually pushed out the door. The amount of work that you do and the quality of that work is not appreciated and will never be enough. "
Dollar General,Dollar General Sales Associate,5,The management was great and everyone was very kind. I have nothing negative to say about this amazing company! The work environment was great as well and the Job duties were very well organized.
Dollar General,Assistant Manager,1,"If you want to work here, understand this, you will have to do the job of 5 people while making the national minimum wage. Also management isn’t the greatest. "
Dollar General,Key Holder,1,Meeting the customers was the most enjoyable part of working for this unfair company.. I would advise stay away unless you are desperate for a job……. 
Dollar General,Management Skills,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?As a store manager district managers are usually busy and leave you alone to run your store. Support between store managers is usually helpfulWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?No work/life balance, weeks on end staying at store to keep it open because poor Associate pay makes hiring difficult. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Culture primarily consists of doing what's needed to keep the store open vs a culture or wanting a successful, clean and shoppable store.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Can be very busy on a truck day, especially if staffing is poor. 99% of most days revolves around stocking."
Dollar General,Lead Sales Associate/Key Holder,4,"it’s actually one of my favorite jobs, so simple to do everything right and no unrealistic expectations, i would stay there for many years if there was any way to be paid more, whether you’re great, good or horrible, you will be paid the same. also very few hours, the managers use up all available hours. i think they’re only allotted like 120 or so hours between all employees a week"
Dollar General,Dollar General Cashier,5,I loved working at the Dollar General please give me another chance. At this particular place I loved helping the customers smile and find what they were looking for.  I also kept the isles clean and straightened. I loved working at the Dollar General Store. 
Dollar General,Lead Sales Associate/Key Holder,2,"Never have enough staff, only 2 people at night, you have to assist sales associates on register most of the day and are given like 4 large tasks plus closing the store in one shift and if you don’t finish even one thing you get reprimanded or written up, even if you haven’t taken a day off in the entire time you’ve worked there and end up needing one, the managers will complain and gossip to other coworkers, they hire random store managers rather than hiring from within, so much wrong. "
Dollar General,Assistant Manager,2,"What is the best part of working at the company? with the right crew you can advance really fastWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working 9 hours no break 6 days a week.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?They push for everything to be done in one dayWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Two words, drove crazy, managers do not care leaving all the work for every one else"
Dollar General,Cashier,1,Most days is 4 hours without a break at all you will perform all jobs even if they are not your job description constantly yelled at for stocking while customers wait even though you have been told by management to stock and given a time limit to get it done you will be required to stock back of store and still watch register. And all this will be done without a single rest period at all.
Dollar General,Sales Associate,1,Promises competitive pay then proceeds to lie about it Will deceive you about hours I was at 34hrs a week to 27hrs a week down to 24hrs a week and lowering I’ve been on 18 hr weeks for weeks on end in the past they only give you hrs if you complain about them! 
Dollar General,Store Manager,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The best part about working for Dollar General is the customers What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Workers are under paid, over worked, store is too impact, not enough hours for stores that are constantly busy, and it’s a revolving door for workers. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Hostile work environment. Most district managers can’t handle 18 to 20 stores. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful, no time for your own family because you have to work 6 days a week and long hours most time you don’t even get a break."
Dollar General,Assitant Manager,1,Don’t pay you enough for what you do great coworkers just dollar general should pay people more can’t get anyone in the door bc the pay isn’t enough to support anyone
Dollar General,Shift Leader,3,I enjoyed working with the other employees. But they don't give the managers enough hours to work people which means the stocking is difficult to maintain. 
Dollar General,Warehouse Associate,1,"This company is ran by bad inexperienced management. They present opportunities of advancement however they fail to follow through on allowing one to grow. The supervisors and managers don’t care to support or assist their team and the warehouse is full of equipment drivers who are coked out or under the influence of some sort of substances. To finalize this review, this place is filled with constant drama and favoritism runs deep. Prepared to be unappreciated, overworked, micromanaged, and set up for failure. "
Dollar General,Store Manager,1,Would not recommend working here this company does not care about anyone at all. No raises hard taking sick days no time off. Manager is terrible corporate management is awful. They work you in exhausted state. It’s be seen not heard
Dollar General,Dollar General Store Manager,1,Don’t care about employees safety or mental health. They try and force you to work doubles and to stay open with call offs. They want there store mangers to basically work 80 hr weeks just to get paid for 40. They tell us we can’t close early even if no one is able to close with us 
Dollar General,Part-Time Key Holder,1,"I liked working with the public at DG. And I basically liked the job overall. However, the pay is among the lowest pay in town. And upper management is always mad that employees don't stock enough, even though you have to continuously run the register since there are no more self checkouts. The store nearest my house has only 1 worker most of the time, and still they get hounded for not getting enough done. Plus, upper management never leaves managers alone after hours. "
Dollar General,Cashier/Sales Associate/Stocker,4,It was good for a first job. The pay is not ideal. It does not have a set schedule and the shifts change often. There were many changes in management. Also not the best with training.
Dollar General,Store Manager,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Nothing company is as greedy as anyone, will work you for minimum wages and treat you badly What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Low pay horrible company will have you in the store by yourself What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Horrible worst place to work will treat you like a slave What is a typical day like for you at the company?Overwhelming they want you to work under the worst conditions possible with almost no pay and no hours"
Dollar General,Sales Associate,1,"i would personally never recommend someone work at dollar general, If you are under 18 and a cashier they expect you to stock, run register, clean all within 4-6 hours. when stocking it is corporate and location standard to finish one rolltainer (7ft tall, 3ft wide, 4ft deep 150-200lbs of merchandise ) in 45 minutes, a typical morning shift consists of coming in at 6am, doing 2-3 rolltainers while simultaneously running register, "
Dollar General,Sales Associate,1,Do not work here. Just don’t. They expect way too much for very little pay and they just treat you badly in general. You go through a lot of mental degradation here. Very little training.
Dollar General,Dollar General Sales Associate,5,The management was great and everyone was very kind. I have nothing negative to say about this amazing company! The work environment was great as well and the Job duties were very well organized.
Dollar General,Retail Sales Associate,1,"Horrible pay, horrible management, horrible store conditions. Don’t even bother. I never got a pay raise and I never got accommodations for my peanut allergy or when I hurt my leg and couldn’t walk."
Dollar General,Shift Leader,2,"I have worked with them for a long time, and though I keep coming back for the convenience in a small town with not much else to offer, I would not recommend it unless you have a perfect team backing you. The system is set up to where if one manager gets behind, the store is nearly impossible to save, and they will not provide enough wage nor hours to properly get things together and properly pay employees. The family atmosphere with the small staff is great but the corporation behind them is awful"
Dollar General,Sales Associate,2,Things were ok until store manager left. The new key holder walked around talking on the phone all throughout the shift and it was difficult to get their attention when the cash register was low on bills. They were lazy and incompetent.  I probably would have stayed if not for that. 
Dollar General,Key Holder/Sales Associate,1,There is a lot of favoritism and you only get moved up if you’re family or friends. You get hurt on the job and your screwed they could care less the upper management only care about them looking good
Dollar General,Sales Associate,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Certain good customers that's about it. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Everything there is stressful. The pay is awful the employees don't do their jobs and the company uses you up. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?No culture. The environment is less than impressive. They won't even hire a guy to do heavy lifting at my store because they can't be working with a man! What is a typical day like for you at the company?Non stop. Running around like a chicken with their head cut off. It's terrible the work load expected to be done plus 100 other things and customers.
Dollar General,Store Manager,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Nothing was good about it.  No work life balanceWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Day in and day out expectation that couldn't be met with the amount of staff they allow the hours  given were ridiculous What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The district manager i had made working conditions uncomfortable What is a typical day like for you at the company?Overwhelming and stressful.  Not enough time in the day to get things done
Dollar General,Sales Associate,5,I put up the products on the shelves helping the customer find things I enjoy talking to the customers The hardest part for me was standing on my feet all day
Dollar General,Cashier/Stocker,2,i worked here for a short period of time and was just a cashier but i was stocking and everything while the rest of them slept in the break room. i would have to get them everytime i needed something it was just rough all together they would go outside and smoke and come in and sleep. they would ask certain customers to bring them back beer.
Dollar General,Lead Sales Associate,3,The biggest problem with Dollar General is that upper management does not care about the stores at all.  If anything breaks or goes wrong it takes months to get any help in the stores.
Dollar General,Lead Sales Associate,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?The job is easy to do, and the people there are nice. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?When there were customers stealing products and trying to hide it from the cameras. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?A pretty good environment. Never complained much about the people I was working with. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Walk in, clock in, do the tasks assigned to me whether it was stocking the shelves or helping customers at the register, take the necessary breaks, back to work and go home for the day. If I had the night shift, I would do the nightly duties like sweeping the floors, clean the restrooms, and making sure everything looked good for the morning staff."
Dollar General,Sales Associate,3,"Overall not a bad company, needs better management and pay for their employees.  More hours.  Schedule changes every other day and hours get cut with no warning. "
Dollar General,"Brooklyn, NY",2,Everybody sits around and talks while they send one new person to handle the rush all alone barely even giving training and then complains when something goes wrong .
Dollar General,Lead Cashier,5,I enjoyed working at dollar general my time there. Not saying all days was good days. But they are all worth memories. I learned a lot working with this company. And met some really good people customers and co- workers that I still have friendship with til this day. I enjoyed my time here and would work here again if was needed 
Dollar General,Key Holder,3,I would have stayed but moved and needed something closer to home. Wish I got paid more for the position but overall a good place. I don't have very many complaints 
Dollar General,Sales Clerk,3,Worked there 2 years but didn't see a way to progress unless someone else leaves or you get your own store. I was lucky that I came in to the store I did when the manager was leaving on maternity leave
Dollar General,Store Manager,1,"This company doesn't care about the physical limitations one person can have, such as sleep, time off with family, regular days off with out being called in each day off.. each experience with the company the district and regional management don't seem to care how individual stores are not being managed correctly, leaving some people to endure the worse side of a stressed out manager. The hours the company provides only seems to look out for the key holders and managers  for scheduling days off and appointments. The 7 day work flow they want the stores to follow and plan their daily work load around is only set in place for stores that have remained in prestigious and perfect condition or are completely new. Once a store is behind or impacted it's near impossible to get caught up and stay on current task with the hours alloted to each tier of employee in stores.. I would not recommend this type of job for anyone. The company it's self expects it's managers to sacrifice their lives to run a store with little to no training and support from district management or regional management in my personal experience working for company. The higher managers in store ( assistant and store manager) are also expected to enroll and endure an awful group chat with all the districts stores involved... the chat is so negative and down putting to all those stores struggle to catch up with no support systems, meanwhile all the prestigious stores get boosted about and bragged upon..They place too much work on cashiers and shift leads to thr point of burn out within a year"
Dollar General,Lead Sales Associate,1,They don't care about their employees. And they like to play favorites. I worked there for 9 months and was able to climb to lead sales associate because they can not keep people. They didn't offer me a raise. They didn't offer me any type of insurance.
Dollar General,Key Holder/Sales Associate,1,This job will work you to the bone and beg you to do anything and everything they manage to pull out.No time off because their turnover rate is awful.Often give part time employees more hours then full time. 
Dollar General,Sales Associate,3,"The beginning of the shift can be extremely busy and last a while leading to not getting much freight out. that being said, management gets upset when incredibly busy but nothing done.Management was not the best set up."
Dollar General,Key Holder,3,"I sincerely do not understand why the salespeople and all the workers at Dollar General receive such low wages. After all, there is always a lot of work, especially during the day. When they come with products or fresh goods. Overall I enjoyed working there, but due to the low pay rate I had to leave for another company."
Union Pacific,Welder Helper/Laborer/Machine operator,2,"Poor planning,no work structure,no process of work tasks,no communication....,wasted time trying to figure work out.... double work cause the whole job wasn't probably thought correctly...lazy union workers... work ethic means nothing... Worst management company ever worked for..."
Union Pacific,Trainman,3,"Gotten tougher over the years with strict attendance policy, but the pay is decent. With advancements in technology, I’m not sure if the people hiring out now will ever see retirement here."
Union Pacific,Conductor,3,"Depending on the job you are assigned too, it can be long, odd hours.  There is little to no supervision  and you are encourage to figure things out for yourself."
Union Pacific,IT Communications Intern,3,"There wasn't much guidance given from my boss or the person that I worked closely with. At the time there were a lot of layoffs happening. Overall, the pay was good, but I didn't feel like I was learning much in the role that I was working in. The essential job tasks of the role that was listed was very different from what they had me doing everyday."
Union Pacific,Auditor,5,your salary would be the highest one in the industry. and there are multiple opportunities for you to grow within the company. but the bad thing is you have to go to the office for 4 days a week
Union Pacific,Loader/Unloader,2,You will have no life. Get called at random times of the day and have to be at work in 2 hours. Management is always up your culu and will try to find a way to write you up for absolutely anything to meet their quotas
Union Pacific,Conductor/Switchman,1,"Constant mismanagement, harassment, organization is completely mismanaged and  left to ( wing it )Operations work on unsafe infrastructure that leave employees to Constant dangers at unsafe paces!Training is left to a bare minimum leaving new employees to train other new employees into a workforce!Unsafe work environment and equipment "
Union Pacific,Associate Project Engineer,2,Layoff quotas yearly. Furlough for union and non union aplenty. Must constantly be proving value to the company. Most of IT is still working on technical debt with some work made in AI space.
Union Pacific,Conductor/Switchman,2,First day in training we were told this. Prepare for never having a schedule. It takes 10 years seniority before you can hold a normal nightshift schedule. Pay is great but work life balance is an all time low
Union Pacific,Truck Driver Class A,2,"Look for another job Pay is not that great.Not a good work life balance.You must be part of a clique Management doesn’t know what they’re doing.If they don’t like you, they will Railroad you"
Union Pacific,Conductor,3,Pay was absolutely PHENOMONAL! Training was very inadequate. You basically have to teach yourself the job once you are done with training. I was not a fan of this.
Union Pacific,Train Conductor,3,"Working a 24/7 on call schedule with 80% travel can be tough especially if you have a family. But the pay and benefits are good. That’s is the major give and take. The job itself can have days of stress, excitement or days where you may do nothing but sit on a train that’s not moving for hours. But safety is key in this line of work. "
Union Pacific,Locomotive Engineer,1,"Absolutely the worst company in America worst working environment worst management worst union nothing but misery. I retired from that place. It was a miracle to even reach retirement. I am so glad to be rid of that awful place. I can’t emphasize how bad it is just to say don’t go there never apply there, they have ruined peoples lives "
Union Pacific,Railroad Signal Maintainer,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Don’t break any rules & courage to care environment.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Having knowledge and patience for safety.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Courage to care & safety attitude.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy, learning to patience, honesty and fear."
Union Pacific,Carman/Welder,1,"Many spend their whole lives trying to get in to working at a railroad job, once you are in, they spend every day finding ways to get rid of you. From operational testing to hurry up and finish the train because it has to leave. If it has wheels underneath and the air test passes, highball it. The work life balance doesn’t exist, you are required to work and the balance in life will forever be rocked. You will not have specific days off, I know people whom have worked over 20 years and they are barely getting some of those nice days off. Overtime is mandatory, unless you have seniority you will work every holiday, every time someone calls in sick or doesn’t show up. If there are people on medical leave, chances are the youngest will work all the overtime to cover that job. In this industry you have to cover your a55, and when you do, you’ll be punished. Example: if you’re working the night shift and you have to take the bigger DoT truck because the other ones are out of service, you will have to do that. It is against the law but you will and if you don’t your future is going to be grim. Not everything is bad news though, this job is perfect for someone whom doesn’t have a family to go home to, single, anti-social people are the perfect candidates. Benefits are top tier, back in early 2000’s you didn’t have to pay a fee for insurance but our unions now work for the company so those nice perks are somewhat at a cost, you will have medical, vision and dental. Dental doesn’t kick in until you’ve been there a full year. Safety: once upon a time you would get a meal every month - more..."
Union Pacific,Locomotive Engineer Remote Control Operator,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?The competitive pay scale and the potential retirement package.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The unreasonable attendance policy and the Horrendous Management team.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful, there is a strong Is versus Them mentality.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Various dependent on the job your called for and the work location."
Union Pacific,Locomotive Engineer,1,On Call 24 hours a day. And the new so call rest days don't align with the time you need off or want off. This company is a dictatorship and very life controlling. 
Union Pacific,Corridor Manager Louisiana/Texas,2,What is the best part of working at the company?The pay was ok but it was definitely not equal. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?We had to work to cover our own vacation. Basically you did not get vacation. 3 on and 3 off but when you go on vacation expect to work 9 straight days when you return. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Upper management lies a lot and tries to find fault to justify a zero or very low bonus and raise. A lot of favoritism when it comes to promotion. What is a typical day like for you at the company?12-15 hour shift as a Corridor Manager. No official lunch break.
Union Pacific,Locomotive Engineer,2,"The local management does their best, but the upper management makes it clear they don't care about your quality of life.  Profit over safety is the prioritization of the railroad industry.  The hardest part of the job is never being home for your family.  The best part of the job is the health insurance.  Due to the lack of a normal sleep schedule for your entire career, you will die younger than you should. "
Union Pacific,Conductor/Switchman,2,As new hires you will be paid great and mind tricked into what you think is the start of a great career just to figure out you will be there temporarily and fired without warning. 98% of my new hire class was fired with no reasoning and most of them did their job very well and safely but just a fare warning try other railroads before Union Pacific my last check was $700 and I know for a fact it should’ve been over $1800 so I’ll just keep their equipment until they can get those numbers right or someone would be willing to buy it 😏
Union Pacific,Diesel Electrician,1,"Worse Place You will ever work, stay away from health fairs , they are checking to see if they can fire you for health conditions.. look online for absentee policy . They will request that nieghbors take your children to doctors appointments . You must schedule your childs illnesses . Family issues will get you fired. You will change jobs and schedules every 2 wks. Vacations are scheduled in december but senority gets priorty for vacation scheduling . Health conditions will get you fired . Medical records will get you fired. Schooling is scheduled on your days off at straight time. Furloughs are based on hiring dates not work ethic or performance. UP is Priorty over Your family at all costs . "

Worst management company ever worked for..."
Union Pacific,HR Intern,5,"Union Pacific Railroad is a great learning opportunity for any students. If you ever get the opportunity to intern at UP, I would definitely take it. You learn so much and develop as a business professional. You actually do real work and see are able to see how you make a difference in the company’s operations. "
Union Pacific,"Apprentice Carmen , CDL A Relief Driver",3,The stockholders called the shots in this company. It’s sad. The work was great. The guys in Southern California are great otherwise overall it’s not that good of a company to work for.
Union Pacific,Operations Manager Trainee,1,Would not recommend to anyone that values a good company culture where your contributions are valued. Management not willing to train new managers outside of the classroom. Very cliquish environment that most everyone will not fit into.
Union Pacific,Conductor/Engineer,1,"Absolutely disgusting. No days off, on call 24/7/365. Every 10 hours the phone rings. They want you to live on trains. Don’t get holidays off, or holiday pay, but they penalize you extra for taking a holiday off. Management is terrible. A lot of high seniority employees are walking out because it’s so miserable. "
Union Pacific,Material Handler,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The best part of working at Union Pacific is the transparency and family like environment What is the most stressful part about working at the company?None . First look within yourself on figuring out how to manage the stressWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Family oriented relationships that truly cares about life outside of work What is a typical day like for you at the company?Typical are reviews of previous metrics and work on daily goals to get locomotives moving
Union Pacific,Senior Electronics Technician,1,"Union Pacific operates like it's 1899 and they have not one care for the wellbeing of their employees.  If you're bumped and you can save your job in another location you are on the hook to move yourself to the new location.  Then they may lay you off at the new place.  Do not risk your wellbeing, family, or health for company that doesn't care about you at all."
Union Pacific,Locomotive Machinist,1,If you’re a share holder it’s great. Otherwise as an employee management spends most of its time trying to fire you. If you’re a new hire you will be on third shift with like Tuesday/ Wednesday of fore like ten years or till they furlough again 
Union Pacific,Conductor,1,"The company does not care about you or your health, all they want is their profits. You are on call 24/7 365 and if you miss days of work due to any health issues or accidental miss calls etc. you basically are fired. Working for UP means no life only work. Never see your family. "
Union Pacific,Conductor,4,"Union/Seniority based, great people you’ll work with. Lifestyle is different then most jobs, you’ll be on call 24/7 for a while. Pay is nice,  big on safety."
Union Pacific,Conductor,1,"Long hours, underpaid, zero respect. Always craft vs management. Great job if you have no life. I would never recommend them as an employer to my worst enemies"
Union Pacific,Locomotive Diesel Mechanic Electrician,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?be prepared to lose your social life and family time. As a new employee you will be working weekends, holidays, and everything else on third shift.  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?keeping up with a sleep scheduleWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?its ok, not the best. With no seniority, you will be working on every job nobody wantsWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?depending on job field. As an electrician, dirty and heavy repairs"
Union Pacific,Yardman,2,Wish i had never hired on. Use to be get your work done and go home. Now its do your work and a bunch of other peoples jobs. They pay you really well so it’s hard to work anywhere else. You give up your life to work there. They say it’s a great paying job but a terrible life. Most people don’t live long after retiring. 
Union Pacific,Electrician,2,"The local management are very fair, decent people. However the company is governed by an insanely greedy, and petty board of directors.    The pay is just ok, but the benefits are great. There is no shift differential, most people have mid-week rest days, and they force everyone to work every holiday. This could be a very nice place to work, but anytime things are flowing smoothly along, the upper management views it as complacency, and does something petty and mean to upset the rhythm.  "
Union Pacific,Railroad Conductor Trainee,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The experience that was it. It’s a lonely job with not nearly enough training What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not enough training, and you are with multiple trainers who all have different approaches to training What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Sometimes laid back and other times toxic. It is by far the most stressful and dangerous job I’ve ever encountered What is a typical day like for you at the company?If given the right assignment it could be tolerable, then again some assignments are doomed for failure."
Union Pacific,Conductor,1,They fire people for points as manager. You could be fired for literally anything and without cause given. No job security even if you make it through probation due to furloughs. People with 10+ years can get furloughed for over a year. With less than 5 years you can get furloughed for 2 years.
Union Pacific,Railroad Conductor,1,"There can be various reasons why some people might express dissatisfaction with working for Union Pacific or any large corporation. Here are a few potential factors:Work Conditions: Railroad work can be physically demanding and often involves long hours, irregular schedules, and exposure to outdoor elements. Some employees may find these conditions challenging or unpleasant.Safety Concerns: Working on or around trains can be inherently hazardous, and safety is a significant concern for railroad employees. Workers may feel that safety protocols or equipment are inadequate or that management prioritizes productivity over safety.Labor Relations: As with any large company, disputes between labor unions and management can arise over issues such as wages, benefits, working conditions, and job security. Employees who feel that their concerns are not adequately addressed by management may become disillusioned or dissatisfied.Management Practices: Dissatisfaction with management practices, including communication, decision-making, and leadership style, can contribute to negative perceptions of the workplace.Job Insecurity: In industries subject to economic fluctuations or technological changes, employees may feel uncertain about the stability of their jobs and career prospects.It's important to note that experiences can vary widely among employees, and while some individuals may express dissatisfaction with working for Union Pacific, others may have positive experiences and find fulfillment in their roles. Additionally, perceptions of a company as an employer can change over - more..."
Union Pacific,General Director,3,"Very motivated by Wall Street and sensitive to social issues.  Largely a good company, with good hard working people.  Needs a consistent strategy and approach over the long term AND ensure they bring in outside talent to balance the homegrown talent."
Union Pacific,Welder Helper- Thermite,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?YOUR FIRST 10 years you will be laid off from September till Feb/March the next year. They don’t tell you this in the interview or in orientation. So after you quit your job and work for UP, be prepared to look for a job come September… also, certain crafts- positions DONT PAY OT.. the union has made you contractors so when you work 15 hour days, it’s all straight time!! NO OVERTIME.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?If you work at a rail yard, and your waiting for trains to pass, and you get to the job 1 min late your fired!! And if you work on a track and forget to get clearance on a wide open track with no trains for miles in each direction, your firedWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Honestly, it all depends on your crew. Some dudes don’t and won’t talk to you, until you know them for 2-3 years. And during your probation they will try to get you to quit or firedWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Winter months are better, summer months are brutal…"
Union Pacific,Backhoe Operator,2,No job security if no seniority dirty job but tons of down time pay is ok. Retirement is great if u make it. But hurts on what u pay in each pay period pay is twice a month
Union Pacific,Account Manager,1, Quality of First level supervisors ( the most important level of supervisor) is non-existent on the Union Pacific Railroad.I had only one good first line supervisor in 28 years in the Marketing & Sales Department of Union Pacific Railroad.At no time in my career with Marketing & Sales in UPRR were there any good senior managers in Omaha headquarters- ever.

Union Pacific,Railroad Conductor,1,You train out of books for 14 weeks and then you get in the real world of working and you don't know how to do your job. Learn as you go environment. 
Union Pacific,Dispatcher,3,"The pay is awesome, when you first start out you’re on the extra board, this is means you’re on call 24/7. Benefits are ok. The company has a great 401k match. "
Union Pacific,Personal Trainer,5,"I arrived at the direct gym to train my students, every week I evaluated to see how we progressed.Organize schedules to plan the routines of each student to be feeding plans at the schedules that had no students supported the reception of the gym, to the hiring of new plans and registration as well as showing the gym facilities.Improve our quality and service"
Union Pacific,Track Laborer,2,"A typical day of work starts with a safety meeting. What you do after that, you never know. The leadership at the Enid, Oklahoma yard is absolutely terrible. They don't keep employees based upon job performance and reliability. They fire people based upon whether or not you fit into their click, and if they like you or not. You hardly work a full 8 hour shift, and currently their is no overtime allowed. Terrible place to work if you are looking for a career and job security. They send you to training for 2 weeks away from your family, and promise good benefits, but don't warn you about the possibility of not having a job at all after training. "
Union Pacific,Foreman,2,To much stress and not enough compensation to go with it. Exhausted employees who are tired to fight it anymore. Benefits are decent pay is ok. They say safety is number o e but indeed it is not.
Union Pacific,Electrician,2,Management is only worried about toting the company line and never about the employees itself. Non electricians are happy to tell the actual trained electricians how to do their job. Zero compromise on anything. Do what we say or else
Union Pacific,Railroad Engineer,1,"Union Pacific is not something you call shift work. You work on call 24/7 365. Management has their hands tied and are usually reluctant to make decisions. Most of the time they are responsible for everything and in control of nothing. If you work in freight service, prepare to lose your family. The average day is 14 hours long and you travel consistently."
Union Pacific,Truck Driver,3,"Good money(when you’re working), great insurance, and pretty good home/work balance but it’s all by seniority whether you’re working or not. The upper management are always trying to find new ways to save them money so one year you may work all year, the next you might work 6 months or less. I’ve got nine years seniority with the company and I still can’t hold a position all year. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone!"
Union Pacific,Carman/Welder,2,"The work hours are good and the people you’ll work with are great. The pay hasn’t kept pace with the work load expected and current rates at other similar trades. Management has little to no experience or sense of how to properly do their jobs. They treat employees like garbage. Instead of being run like a business, it’s run like a prison. Do not expect to be treated with any sense of basic human decency here. "
Union Pacific,Engineer ,3,Nothing to say. On call 24-7. Takes a long time to get any decent seniority. Insurance is really good. Can be an interiors job if your head isn’t on a swivel. 
Union Pacific,diesel elctrcian,2,As Warren Buffett said the Union Pacific Railroad is the most poorly run gold mine there is. Management is horrible The people you work with make it almost bearable.
Union Pacific,Intern,2,"If you are applying here as an intern I would strongly recommend you find somewhere else to work. Overall, my experience at Union Pacific as an intern was unfulfilling. I was uninspired by the work I was doing and the people I worked with, who also seemed equally unfulfilled. From my perspective as an intern, so few people enjoyed the work they were doing, and this has even effected company culture as it is common for people to switch departments after a year of work. This happened to me during my internship and I had to help train my own manager. I'm aware that being an intern my experience may not be universal to the entire company, but if I was able to notice culture problems after an internship I don't see how it could get any better."
Union Pacific,Conductor,3,Good work for sure definitely a place with amazing benefits and opportunities to get financially set and do work that is beneficial to your country.  
Union Pacific,Assistant Forman,1,"This company is not a company to work for anymore. At 1 point in time, maybe 1015 years ago. It was a fabulous place to work. Now, this company tries to take advantage of every person. That's out there. Working harder, pay him less Labors and they want the same amount of work to be performed as if it was a full crew.I'm ready to leave this place due to the fact of how they treat employees..."
Union Pacific,"Director, Operations",3,Limited opportunities for promotion if you don't want to move to the field. Limited opportunities in Omaha. Shareholders are king right now. Employees not a priority. Little job security. Guaranteed to be more cuts if we can't become obscenely profitable and quick. Work generally not rewarding. People generally unhappy. Things have been much better and will be better again. In 2-3 years maybe.
Union Pacific,Conductor,3,"I loved what I did but the terrible work culture and constant fear of being terminated was too much, good pay but for what they put you through you should at least make 100% pay instead of steprate."
Union Pacific,Conductor,1,"terrible work environment , no work life balance, sneaky management trying to fire you all the time. On the road all the time, Great Job but a terrible company to work for"
Union Pacific,Manager Locomotive Maintenance ,2,"Location was actually pretty good to work for, unfortunately at the time corporate only cared about increasing profit through any means necessary. Company wants management to continously move and progress career with no thought given to family or home life. Would not recommend working for this company."
Union Pacific,Manager,1,"Micro managing, unqualified and useless peopled in management positions only because of favoritism. Management always keeps staff at low levels to ensure employees work the maximum hours possible . If you need off your co worker usually has to come in on a rest day making it seem like it’s  you’re fault for having to be off. They have done this for years.. if you seem to be able to do your job good they will always find a special project for you to keep you more busy.. this is a notorious environment you must keep your thoughts to yourself or even your co workers will stab you in the back only to try and get recognition from a boss to try and look good.

Union Pacific,Conductor/Engineer,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?The pay and benefits are excellent. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?If you are a Conductor/Engineer, you will be on a 24hrs call. Once called you have 2hrs to get to work. Also prepare yourself to be furloughed oh so often. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is like most, no one wants to work with the new guy, only because he doesn't know all the ins and outs, it takes him/her to long, etc, etc.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Once your train is together, it's smooth sailing. Not a lot of hard labor. Just a lot of walking. Also be prepared for long slow rocking train rides. No phones, tablets, books, radios, or any electrical devices that you would normally use when going on a long ride to keep you awake. Because that train will rock you to sleep."

Union Pacific,Conductor/Switchman,3,Can get furloughed before and always someone looking for you to mess up so they can pull you out of service. Pay is good so that’s why most people deal with the cons ..

Union Pacific,Machinist (Diesel Locomotive Mechanic),4,"Job assignment/tasks are clearly explained. Efficient turnover explained. Easy to work with other Job Craftsmen. As a Railroad Company,  Safety is key. APPRENTICESHIP is sufficient for advancement in Job Craft. "
Union Pacific,Train Operator,1,Work can be fun seeing different parts of the region. Training is long. Sometimes you get to work and then sometimes you can be stuck in motel waiting for work. 
Union Pacific,Business Analyst / Systems Engineer,2,"This used to be an amazing place to work, with benefits far exceeding the norms for other jobs (at least those in the Omaha area).  Then big mutual funds bought a majority of stock and the vultures set in...Several rounds of layoffs - some a surprise, others anticipated - to get ""lean"" bit too deep and didn't result in evenly distributed responsibilities.  Benefits have been pared away and some that still exist are difficult to use (ask any TE&Y - train, engine, and yard - employee about punitive measures applied if they take a day off for a funeral or kid's graduation). Corporate culture has changed from helpful coworkers and friendly rivalries between departments to overworked employees who are forced to throw each other under the bus to avoid being laid off themselves.  Advancement is still possible for sycophants, but the average employee can languish in their current pay band for years receiving diminishing benefits and pay increases below the rate of inflation - if they aren't fired without cause with no indications."
Union Pacific,Conductor,4,"Crazy schedule, Great pay, Good Benefits. Enjoyed working for them.  Benefits are good. Be prepared to travel all over the state.  Trains are fun and management isn’t bad. "
Union Pacific,MYO,4,"Pays well, hours suck, it’s a railroad. PSR is a downfall of the class 1s but you have to do with what you have. DONT hire out directly for management, hire out as a conductor and get your seniority first so you have a fall back if you hate being a manager. "
Union Pacific,Conductor/Switchman,1,"Terrible place. No work life balance, always on call. Always testing you, harassing, not safe at all. They will put you on trains in territories without any guidance. They do not care about your safety. "
Union Pacific,Conductor,1,"Plan on not being available in any meaningful capacity for your family. Its a good way to make 8 grand a month and put you in the fast track to a divorce, and plan on looking over your shoulder for the next furlough."
Union Pacific,Conductor,1,"they sugar coat everything while training and act like they want you and care about you, But they are just another multi-billion dollar company who has managers constantly wanting to get rid of people and people who worked there for years who will throw you under the bus for anything just for more money on their paycheck"
Union Pacific,Conductor/Engineer,4,"Cool so far. There’s things to gripe at like any job you’re ever going to work. You’re compensated very well. What you choose to do with that compensation is up to you. Never stay anywhere you feel miserable at, no matter what you’re paid. 😉"

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Upper management and the stupidity What is the work environment and culture like at the company?A joke. Sad,  depressing and pathetic What is a typical day like for you at the company?Waiting around to get called to work and finally getting called 12 hrs later for a 14 hr day including the call to work."
Union Pacific,Electrician,5,You come you do the job and you go home. Pay is good and the work is not really that hard. Management is not that bad. They do not really bother you if you are doing your job.

Union Pacific,Truck Driver/Machine Operator,2,10 years ago it was a decent place to work but it has rapidly went downhill. You are just a number. No one cares about you or your family. Big time buddy system. Constant job cuts so you never know if you'll have a job tomorrow
Union Pacific,Conductor,3,"Fantastic money, But you will need to give up almost all your free time to work here. They have an attendance point policy, which if you exceed (very easy too) you will be terminated. "
Union Pacific,MSO,1,"Good Money but will pay a price for it. Cult Mentality, If you have an opinion don’t voice it or seem like you stand up for yourself because you will be out. Everyone works together plus management if your considered a threat. When you make light of unethical practices. "
Union Pacific,Conductor,1,Terrible place to work unless you like to be laid off all the time then it’s great. Worked there 7 years and laid off about 5 of them. Management is very toxic.

Worst management company ever worked for..."
Union Pacific,Manager Environmental Field Operations,1,"If you are a person who likes to be treated like more than a number, supported by management and trained well this is NOT the place for you! The culture is not what you know but who you know and the corporate politics are extremely hard to navigate. If you have a disability, they will not make even the most reasonable accommodations for you. This is not a supportive or positive culture nor is it a place that cares about their employees in any way. The ONLY thing they care about are the stockholders. "
Union Pacific,Conductor/Switchman,1,"This is the worse place to work, after training for months, you have to chase seniority in whatever city you can hold a position and potentially get knocked off there, I understand that seniority is important but the way things are structured and how it all works, they take seniority to the extreme which leaves new hires out on there butts and forced to work somewhere they don’t want to go or can’t afford to go "
Union Pacific,Sr. Analyst,2,"The company was better before the downsizing. While the culture has suffered, there are still decent groups in the company. However, these are harder and harder to find."
Union Pacific,Conductor,3,"Great place to start out at in the railroad industry to get your foot in the door, but there is no off time to do anything for yourself let alone family. At times I was the first one to be called out for more than 12 to 24 hours depending if trains were backed up, if you were already awake for 8 to 10 and called in for a unknown amount of time workshift that varies from 8 to 12 you'll have a rough time staying away."
Union Pacific,Signalman,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?The money was the best part.  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not getting hurt. The safety concerns were overwhelming. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Get the work done or you will be shunned.

Advise against applying.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Trusting management; safety in the wilderness without the ability to defend yourself.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic.

Union Pacific,MSO,2,Horrible place with horrible management. Management will run you dry. They won’t care about you as long as their job is safe at the end of the day. First job I ever had that I don’t recommend to people
Union Pacific,Eletrician,1,corporate greed is out of control with this company. I worked at the same location for 21 years and now upper management is making major cuts to the company making it unstable for both. It's customers and it's employees. do not work here

The company then tries to form policy's that make it look like it's already doing as the major news announcements.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Hope you don't get fired for doing same thing that their computers get away with doing ,yet since you're human and make the same call you in turn are fired."
Union Pacific,Conductor,5,It’s the railroad you work and sleep and repeat all again 10 hours later. Training for the new hires is absolutely a joke then be expected to know everything after a month
Union Pacific,Conductor,1,They just keep taking and don’t have a care for safety. Also they are putting more work on the employees left making 2 man jobs to one. Also getting strict on time off can’t take went you want

Union Pacific,Carmen,2,"Managements is absolutely the worst! No family or social life, as you will work weekends, graveyard shift, holidays. I wouldn’t go back if the doubled my wage! The benefits started out great over 20 yrs ago however even those have taken a nose dive. I would recommend anything before working for Union Pacific Railroad. "
Union Pacific,Conductor/Switchman,3,Good overall experience.  Some issues with management at times high turnover. Long and unpredictable work hours until seniority is built up. Co workers look out for each other and safety is priority 
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Insurance Customer Service Agent,5,"From the very beginning this company provides excellent training, great benefits and pay. The job is rewarding and they truly care about their employees. I no longer work there but would consider it again if I decided to go back down that career path. A great place for someone who wants a great entry level experience in the insurance field. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Adjunct Faculty,4,Great environment loved working here and with all the employees super cool and friendly and it’s and amazing company to work for I have no complaints about it 
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Insurance ,4,"Good company inclusive , benefits from day one pay is good there are some issues just like any company . Should strive to provide good service over being all about numbers "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Auto Damage Appraiser II,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?High production, stringent goals, minimal career building opportunities, and feeling under valued. I did not enjoy my experience thought I truly hoped that I would. I don't think it is the Liberty Mutual it once was, but I think it is because of a restructuring period when the economy has been in shambles. I think if Liberty Mutual can overcome the financial deficit they have been in and realign to making a positive work environment over less man power pushing more work thay they can be reinvented into the incredible company that once were...and no longer are at this time. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Feeling disposable for any reason and at any time. The leaders were not looking for chances to improve and grow employees but to trim the fat due from over hiring at a time the company was shrinking it's book of business to virtually stay ahead in production and reduce overhead in tiers and the policies in force shrank. Avoiding layoffs and justifying terminations by changing structuring of goals multiple points within a year and making goals stringent. Forcing people to feel a need to work outside of hours to complete their workload, produce goals and secure their position. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?I think there is a correlation in the misalignment at this time because the company had to take a string initiate to correct and balance the books to keep from losing any more ground. What is a typical day like for you at the company?It was stressful and unfilling."
Liberty Mutual Insurance,CSR - Customer Service Representative,3,"Love the work, great work/life balance, hard to get foot in door to level up, working on that now, but once you’re in, use any position as leverage to gain skills and use them to further you LM career or apply elsewhere and ask for your worth! "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Analyst I,4,"The thing I miss most about working at Liberty is the people. They helped me develop tremendously both personally and professionally.Add in challenging projects to work on, I really enjoyed my experience at LM."
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Product Designer,3,"The pay, benefits, and work life balance were excellent! Most of the people I came in contact with were really nice. The challenge of working here is that if you are someone who states it like it is, you will not be appreciated.  Indirect talk is preferred. You will thrive if you fit in with the preferred communication style."
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Sales Representative,4,"The company provides very thorough and comprehensive training where new employees could go through modules to learn quickly. It prepares employees for the exam well. After that, a team is assigned to the new salesperson and the selling starts there. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Category Manager,3,Not organized nor mature processes. There is a lot of people that try to progress but can be hard to do depending on the area you are in. Do not recommend. 
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Underwriting Assistant,4,Good place to work while I was there where's the benefits were better and the career opportunities were more. Hopefully they've updated their technology it was lacking
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Licensed Insurance Agent,3,Liberty was an awesome company to work for till we got a new CEO. After that everything just went south. The whole company went through a reorganization. Thousands of people were laid off. The employees that weren't laid off were required to do a lot more work. OH and then they kept raising our goals and decreasing our sales opportunities. Literally made it impossible to make money. I'm glad I got out when I did. 
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Insurance Assistant,3,"Large volume of work, busy, tons of mail, learned to wear multitask and cross train work part of a team and innovate. Management is very patient and polite they come up with different ideas to make work more productive. Hardest part is the volume and not being able to advance and grow. The pay is not that great for the amount of work I did and juggled. I was busy and always asked about ideas and had lots of flexibility. The Attorneys were great. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Licensed Insurance Agent,2,"Work life balance is okay, the pay is okay if you’re a good sales agent. Basically pinned to your desk for 8 hours taking call after call.  They have now transitioned to aggregator leads which are garbage and very low converting. They are on you about every metric (including those that have nothing to do with sales) so you gotta be on your A game. Used to like working there but now I feel like I need a shot of tequila every-time I leave for the day. Felt a sense of relief when I put in my two weeks. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Customer Service Representative,4,"Working for them was ok, nothing too exciting or rewarding in the day to day tasks. It paid the bills but nothing about the role ignited a passion inside me. It's insurance, so 50% of your calls are pleasant and respectful callers and the other half are full of complaints and entitlement. I don't blame the company for that, it's just humanity. However, dealing with that all day can eventually feel exhausting. It's a great temporary role.... after a year or two it will be time to move up or move on. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,CSR - Customer Service Representative,4,"I received incredible training. Although the nature of the job was fast paced, I felt very prepared. It was a great work environment, lots of perks if you do your job well. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Recruiter,4,"Good company, some pretty good benefits. I really enjoyed my time there but was laid off.   If you are a hard worker and get your work done you will have a great experience working there. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Customer Service Representative,3,"Good company for Entry-Level hires. Great starter company for those seeking to enter the insurance field. The metrics were hard to meet. 401k. Onsite fitness, center. Cafeteria "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Special Investigator,3,There is a good amount of job security (or so it feels like). The culture has changed a lot and appears to learn more metrics and numbers driven. It’s hard to know if you’re doing a good job.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Lead Sales Representative,1,"Comparion was born from the Liberty Mutual captive sales force. They resisted and continue a true brokerage model, where compensation aligns with the effort to maintain a quality book of business. To top this off, the management team lacked an understanding of marketing trends, primarily due to their age and last selling experience during the pre-internet era. This meant you were locked in to largely antiquated and robotic ways of accomplishing your goals. It was the classic case of an organization claiming they are working smarter, but in fact working far harder than necessary. This leaves me with the ultimate reason you would not want to work with Comparion, they want to make their employees, not contractors but W-2 employees, pay for their own marketing efforts. A book you don’t own, aren’t paid much for renewal and can’t market effectively with corporate communication restrictions from parent company Liberty Mutual. The book and carrier access is now extremely limited. Turnover in both employees and customers is high and building a growing book that can be rewarded is nearly impossible. You are expected to ignore current customers for new business generation, similar to Comcast and the rates always go up too. Anyone can write the carriers Comparion offers and if you were to start an agency, you could write the same ones without all of the restrictions and poor management. It’s simply put: A poor business model, built on the backs of employees who are underpaid for the work and forced to spend their own money to generate sales activity.  Not a place to build a career, - more..."

Liberty Mutual Insurance,Intern,5,Learned a lot during my internship Great cultureNot stressful Management was nice Nice office Benefits and PTO Not boring Good to start your business and move 
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Remote,1,I worked for liberty mutual for nearly 2 years. No advancement but was consistently told I was within the top three reps and the team I was on. Always pushing for leads. Bonuses for trash not even 2000 for the year. PTO is spoon fed at 12 hours per month. With no time accrued in November or December... Pay is not that great. And the way that you are paid is quite a joke.. apparently you were paid a week ahead instead of a week behind... Which means if you leave you will owe the company money. I do not recommend Liberty mutual to anyone and I will stand on that for the rest of my life.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Attorney ,1,Typical woke company that uses DEI over merit. Management are u skilled drones with no vision. This is a settlement mill that offers no value to ones long term outlook. Alot of snobby eliteism.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Sales Representative,1,This company is very metrics driven definitely not a good job for work life balance. They have OK benefits but time off is absolutely minimum compared to most jobs. The call volume is insane and they don’t care about their employees well being. They care only about metrics and money. I witnessed people leaving in flocks. 
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Licensed Claims Representative II,1,"Time is not flexible, it’s hard to get time off and the turn over rate is high. Very limited time off in the summer months. If you have a family this is not the Job for you. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Underwriting Assistant,4,Very inclusive large company. Good benefits and pay. Able to work remotely. Good employee support. Information during transitions can sometimes be very limited.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Lawyer,3,"It is a pleasant place, the only thing is that they are not open to teleworking and the desks are super uncomfortable, they make you go to see you there"
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Sales Representative,3,"Everyone cheats the system at Liberty.  You are basically trained on this.  This is why the renewal rates are normally so high... the system catches up with the ""cheat"" upon renewal and the customer is left with no choice but to switch carriers.  "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Insurance Agent,3,"It was a pretty nice process. The hardest part really is getting your license and passing the exam in order to actually get the licensed portion started. Your usual call center job. The curriculum that you have to do is A LOT but digesting it slowly is the best method. They're actively improving their monitoring team when you're doing On The Job Training so it's not perfect currently, but there is still a lot of improving that they're striving for."
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Commercial Claims Liability Adjuster,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?The was a semi decent paying job. As a starter job it was goid pay.

Or complete dynamic/vibe/procedure style I had to change to on the fly once my original manager got promoted. I went from an understanding situation where my numbers were good and my first evaluation was great to then getting fired before hitting a yearWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Culture is almost like any other corporate location only the lie to you better and also leave you alone more until it becomes a problem to numbers and then it conpletly changes to micro management and boom no job 6 months laterWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Get up go to work, then get told how I wasnt getting it by multiple managers then have them individually coach me then do it again at my next mess up"
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Software Engineer,4,"Lots of opportunities to improve your skill set.  Supportive team members, they will help you to grow. Changes team every.6 to 8 months which will help you work with new tech stacks. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Underwriting Assistant ,1,Outsourcing our jobs to offshoring.  Lots of people have lost their job this past year. CEO does not care about employees its all about saving a buck. 
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Licensed Insurance Agent,3,I actually really liked working at liberty mutual. I worked in the auto department and it was never a boring day because I got to talk to people from all walks of life. My colleagues and supervisor were all pretty chill and they didnt make a huge deal about stats
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Sales Representative,5,"As a direct writer, Liberty Mutual provided a good opportunity for their field sales force.  Now, with the switch to Comparion Insurance for their field sales force, there is some uncertainty.  Still, benefits and retirement are unmatched at LM. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Fast Path,2,"Management acts as if they care about your wellbeing  but don’t. You’ll leave feeling used and abused.  If you do your job well, you’ll also be doing everyone else’s. "

Liberty Mutual Insurance,Claims Representative,5,Liberty Mutual is a great place to work. The benefits were great and I enjoyed my time there. Caseloads can be high sometimes but there was a great team environment 
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Licensed Insurance Agent,3,This was a good company to work for before inflation . It started making calls harder and longer . Management became very pushy to fire employees including management.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Workers' Compensation Hearing Specialist / Paralegal I,4,"I liked that there was plenty of support if you have questions, but they also leave you alone to do your job. I only left because of low pay. Medical benefits could be better too. Lots of FTO though. Claims department needs an overhaul with an emphasis on response times and accountability. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Sr. Project Manager,1,Liberty is undergoing a lot of change right now and has had rolling layoffs for a year now. No job is safe. It was a great company for the longest time but the recent CEO and management changes have led to some bad business practices. It is not the same company anymore.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Recruiter,5,"My direct leader offer support, guidance, and encouragement which make the job enjoyable. Culture is positive and I’m always learning new skills and techniques within the Talent Acquisition team. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Claim Specialist,1,"Horrible environment where you’re completely overloaded to the point you cannot keep up at which time a middle manager that is aware of the overload will micromanage you knowing there is no way to keep up. Several adjusters have left the complex team specifically due to micromanagement which eventually turned into harassment, and even more either left the Core team or were let go because they couldn’t keep up with u realistic expectations. There is NO WORLD where an adjuster can have 200+ files with over half in litigation & not miss SOMETHING in the 1,000s of emails & documents that are being dumped on you DAILY.  Leadership does absolutely nothing & gaslights employees into thinking it is their lack of skill or effort, no you just won’t ever keep up unless you work 7 day a week 10+ hour days. Pay is ok, health is ok but be warned they are not forthcoming with the inventory you will be assigned it’s essentially a revolving door. Godspeed to those that apply here & hats off to those that were able to make it work, hope you use your PTO at least. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Claims Adjuster,1,"Very competitive, toxic environment with massive workload and little support after training.  They believe in learning by making mistakes and then use those mistakes against you.  Unsupportive environment."
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Fast Path Adjuster II,2,"Did not enjoy my time working in fast path. Company overall focuses too much on saving money and not enough on employee mental health. Overworked, benefits are average and pay is average if not slightly above what I've seen, though less than I was promised in the interview process.Fast Path as a whole changed dramatically over the years I was there and is much more complex than it ever has been.20 days a year FTO for the first 3 years, then it bumps to 24 which includes 3 sick days since they removed one for Juneteenth."
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Property Claims Adjuster,4,Workload and metrics were unrealistic. Training was decent but alot you have to learn on your own. Because of the stress from this job I ended up with 2 pinched nerves in my back & shoulder blade that I still have to this day. 
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Claims Adjuster,3,It’s ok if you don’t want a balanced work and home life. Micromanaging and just an overload of claims with no real direction from mgmt. They’ll tell you what’s wrong but is limited on suggestions to help. Benefits and pay are good. Hugh turnover

Claims office closed most major holidays including Juneteenth and MLK. 
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Senior Sales Advisor,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Excellent when I started!! Great training & very supportive managers & trainers. However, in the last year things changed & what was once an enjoyable career turned into a daily squeeze. Creativity & individuality went out the window & the job was not the same any longer.

Many people left as there was no recourse or true explanation.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The changing matrix & lack of individual value. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very controlled & metrix driven. Not necessarily bad but that’s not how the job was presented. It changed, negatively, over time. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Incoming phone calls for 8-10 hours."
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Claims Examiner II,1,"New management and it became overwhelming. Expected you to answer all live calls and be available 7hrs per day. Calls answered live had to be 100% and still expected to clear all task each day, no task left behind. "

Liberty Mutual Insurance,Financial Analyst,3,"I have been working as a Financial Analyst at Liberty Mutual for the past two years, and overall, my experience has been quite positive. The company fosters a supportive and collaborative "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Claims Adjuster,1,Liberty mutual provided poor support and training. You are over worked and underpaid. Of the 16 ppl in my training class only 5 stay w the company for more than 6 months.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Insurance Customer Service Agent,5,"From the very beginning this company provides excellent training, great benefits and pay. The job is rewarding and they truly care about their employees. I no longer work there but would consider it again if I decided to go back down that career path. A great place for someone who wants a great entry level experience in the insurance field. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Auto Property Damage Adjuster,5,"My first year was very fulfilling and I learned a lot. When I started, I only received a few new claims per day. There was a ramp up phase and by the time you were there for about 6 months, you would be a full capacity and receive up to 8 new claims per day. That combined with the prior claims that you were still working made it hard to return phone calls and follow up.My last six months at Liberty Mutual were very stressful as the department standards had been raised and the amount of claims that I was responsible for was overwhelming. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Field Claims Adjuster,4,Good place to work with good middle management . Sometimes upper level management made decisions that were not in the best interests for the field employees.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Data Scientist,3,"it is not a bad company to work for - pay is okay, benefits are okay (health insurance is bad though, very high deductible). Also you get free parking in downtown Boston during non-business hours. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Inside Sales Associate,3,Over all my experience was ok. It was cool and he first few months but once you go live they pressure you each month and almost hang your job over your head if your not meeting their unrealistic goals that only a hand full of people do. If you a seasoned agent that’s been in the game for years you will probably love it but if your a young new agent like I was trying to figure out your path you may find yourself miserable and not making the money they promise in your interview. Great culture but think twice about the job
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Paralegal,5,Lots of good benefits. Hybrid work. I gave it five stars because I believe it is generally a really good place to work however the company is restructuring and the future is uncertain for some folks in legal. Good work life balance / no OT.  Good learning environment.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,INSIDE AUTO CLAIMS ADJUSTER,5,"This job was maybe one of the best jobs I’ve had thus far!! There were lots of pros and a few cons. The good outweighed the bad in my opinion! Good salary, great hours, amazing training, company perks, etc. But the work does get tedious and stressful. Claims pile up and if someone leaves or is off, you get their claims split up as well!! PTO/Vacation time is great! And they offered stress leave. I unfortunately had to leave due to an illness.  Management was clicky as well."
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Customer Service Representative,4,Diverse group of insurance professionals who enjoy what they do and don't mind training the next generation of insurance professionals. I would recommend as a great place to start your insurance career.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Casualty Claims Adjuster,3,"Not up to date with salaries in the industry. Love the people I work with but upper management clearly only sees you as a number. There has been a lot of turnover but no openings, just shuffling around to make numbers make sense so feels like growth opportunities are not coming for awhile"
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Field Claims Adjuster,5,Claims department provides their adjusters with the proper tools and resources to process claims. The volume of claims was impossible to keep up with though..

Liberty Mutual Insurance,Customer Service Representative,5,"Been working in the CRC for about almost 2 years, been great so far. Trying to go to sales, and see that side of the company.  Look forward to being in that side"
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Customer Service,1,"The training made no sense, trainers were unresponsive, there's no shadowing to build experience with system or process and your resources to use while on a call are a joke.Toxic attitude towards people who take off for pto/vto. Lots of gossip. Left to your own devices during training then thrown to the wolves."
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Total Loss Claims Adjuster,3,"your experience on who you have as a manager , they allow the managers too much freedom and they all run a different shop. Also job security is scary, 4 of the people from my training class were fired within the first year "

Senior leaders lacking firsthand knowledge of the reality of the current state of the industry. Working unpaid overtime hours. Disorganized commission payments and tracking of payments.

There is enforcement of no push-back to portray a positive environment.

Unanswered questions leaving you digging for answers. Spending overtime hours quoting only to be left with no competitive options for your customers."

Liberty Mutual Insurance,Claims Supervisor,3,"Expectations to work to a very high standard. Once in claims there is no way to transfer to other job families or divisions, very siloed. It is like most in the company have a poor view of those in claims. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Product Director,4,"Fair pay and amazing flexibility for those not within 50 miles of an office. Underwent many org changes and RIFs in the last year leading to cultural fatigue. Overall, positive experience and fair compensation. Big organization and slow moving decision making / decision making by consensus a big challenge but does mean speed of work is moderate."
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Claims Representative,1,"poor management, lack of support, cheap equipment and materials, unreasonable quotas, no quality of life, nothing is ever enough and I would never work for this company again."
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Insurance Agent,3,"Commission structure has changed which is really tough. Used to be a great place to work. Not so much any longer, rates are ridiculous making it very hard to sell. Horrible work shifts no work life balance "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,hight Touch Sales Agent,3,Liberty Mutual is a good company and has great management. The company is going through a transformation and i decided to invest in myself and do my own business. I would recommend.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Insurance Assistant,4,"I enjoyed my time working a Liberty. Everyone was supportive, and I couldn’t have asked for a better team. Unfortunately, I couldn’t relocate to Plano, TX once our office was closed."
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Adjuster II,4,The company had a lot of changes and does a good job of communicating that with employees and encourages personal development. Systems are slow and overall mind-numbing which kills productivity.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Attorney,5,I started as a trial lawyer right out of law school and it is an excellent place to get experience for your practice. Knowledgeable staff and friendly work environment.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Attorney,3,Upper management does not care if we have the resources to do our jobs. They pay us very low compared to other similar jobs and put more emphasis on process than substantive work.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Sales Associate,3,"Good place to work and it’s remote, goals have gotten pretty ridiculous lately while they continue to turn business away so it can be tough, good for hard workers"
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Sales Advisor,5,I love this company. i see alot of people complaining about work loads thats with every insurance job some people need to be greatful that you have a job you could be without.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Workers Compensation Claims Adjuster,1,"Terrible place to work. Especially in the workers comp department. They pile work and work on top of you and don’t care if you’re not experienced. They constantly are increasing metrics and adding more metrics and then they gaslight you when u can’t achieve all the necessary work. At the point where I don’t care about the quality of my work. Also, when people take vacations prepare to cover their desk although u are getting 70 emails per day multiple new claims a day, claims reviews. They do not care. If you are young please do not start a career here. Do something meaningful with your life. I get paid $75000 to be an attorney, therapist, doctor, admin assistant and etc. I can’t wait to quit this job!"
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Claims Service Representative,4,"Overall a great place to work, claims and insurance can be stressful regardless. I enjoyed my time with Liberty Mutual as it has a great training program. "
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Auto Claims Adjuster,3,I was with Liberty for 2 years and the after the 1st quarter this year it was relieved that the company did poorly the prior year. So the micromanaging began and unrealistic metric goals was put in place.Regardless of the claims volume increasing management wanted you to maintain your metric continuously.Liberty is a very stressful place to work and if you seek for any form of assistance from your manager the micromanaging will start.
Liberty Mutual Insurance,Adjuster,5,"They foster a great work environment and want you to succeed. Great benefits and pay. Very high expectations, but there’s a lot at stake. They spend a lot of time helping development. "

Overall, Company’s dynamic environment was instrumental in my professional growth as a quality engineer."
Abbott,Assembler,1,"I learned a many thing. I learned about medical devices, how to build, test, and package. I learned to do inbound/outbound, and quality inspection. First thing is huddles, where supervisor talks about production, safety, and announcements. We do out stretches. Go to our dest and log on to Dallas world, we work cams-tar, APLM, outlook, and follow VMI to work on a job."
Abbott,Op 1,4,"You don't earn so well but it has many benefits, I think it's a good company to start but after a while it is not so profitable.Other positions are much better"

Abbott,"Tipp City, OH",2,I don’t like it here and hopefully will find something else soon.  The training is good for manufacturing but lacking in other areas. Some people in charge should not be in charge. But are allowed to promote to lead but have no leadership skills.

Abbott,Assembler,2,"The work is fairly simple, and there's quite a few stations you can cross-train into eventually. Coworkers are a mixed bag. There were periods where workers were encouraged to work six days a week for months on end. Management is the type to mandate you come into work during Hurricane Helene while they stay at home."
Abbott,Calidad,4,The work environment is good benefits good clean facilities excellent processes in the areas of medical devices good to start your career
Abbott,Production Operator,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Absolutely nothing.

Overall, Company’s dynamic environment was instrumental in my professional growth as a quality engineer."
Abbott,Material Handler,2,The whole location has a problem. They have a click of men who walk around thinking they are the best thing around. They like to blame you for problems even when they are well aware of them. No growth opportunities.
Abbott,Warehouse Operative,3,"Typical day at work busy, always being pulled from your work,  being Punished for making a human error, asking for help but never Receiving it, team leader will push you to your limit to achive his own goals, typical big factory, you are just a number there while everyone pretends to care about you, coming and dojng your job is not enough for them, you will have to give 120% of yourself and still not good enough,  different shift getting better treatment even you working at same place "
Abbott,Quality Control Technician II,1,Be prepared to have your schedule changed with less than a 24 hours warning.

Abbott,IT Support Technician,1,It is not a good company to the employee the treatment on the part of the company is not the best
Abbott,"Scarborough, ME",1,"Management takes no responsibility when things go wrong. Company is exclusively reactive to problems. New ideas are ""encouraged"".No job security, regular yearly layoffs followed in 3-6 months by frantic hiring. Great training programs, that are not followed. "
Abbott,Machine Operator II,3,"What is the best part of working at the company?Clean, climate controlled work environment. Great hourly pay.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The large majority of employees well remain temporary with no benefits, as I did for three years. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Fairly pleasant, work environment, plenty of work to do. As long as you are happy to remain a temporary employee It is a decent job.What is a typical day like for you at the company?there’s plenty of busy work to do in production. Breaks are regularly scheduled. The regular employees get preference over the temporary employees"
Abbott,Technical Manufacturing Chemist,1,"The culture at this place is toxic beyond comprehension. Seasonal layoffs every March-May followed by seasonal hiring in the fall for “temp-to-hire” positions. These are the bulk of the people who are laid off in March-May with a smattering of full time employees they’ve grown tired of.  Site management condones toxic behavior amongst employees and based off who they choose to promote, may actually encourage it. "
Abbott,Insights Manager,4,"Good people and learning place. Many chances to improve as an individual, and bosses listen to concerns and help grow you. Not very hierarchical in nature and collaborative in style"
Abbott,Call Agent,5,Very good work environment.Good training.And a lot of information about the work that will be done.
Abbott,Quality Engineer,3,"Line support engineers endure a lot of work. Promotions are not easy to come by. It doesn’t matter how hard you work, it all comes down to money. The only good thing about this company is the people. The work is insane and doesn’t end when you get home. When they switched all line support engineers to 5 am, that’s when everyone began dreading work even more. It also sucks that we are paid less than any other site in California."
Abbott,Complaint Investigator,1,"This is the worst department to work for in Abbott. There is clear favoritism and you will get in trouble for every little thing under the sun, and they will fire you for it. They only make their friends permanent while there are people who have been there 3+ years working their butt off. Lame company and provide no growth. "
Abbott,Software Engineer,3,"Company made you work too much overtime. Work life balance was horrible, even though the work was interesting. Too much turnover because of this, causing project to get delayed even more."
Abbott,Batch Maker,5,but unfortunately shutdown permanently.  Nice training and nice people working with. Good benefits and generous with salary increases. Has a chance to travel and visit other sites/ facilities. 
Abbott,Buyer,3,"Abbott is a great starting company for a professional career. If you reside in Illinois you will need to telecommute to Abbott park as they are not big on remote work. Good people at Abbott. The work was decent. I was busy most days. You will learn a lot as they make position & quality training mandatory. The only drawback is management. When I was there, managers didn’t stay very long which impacted my career growth. Suggest establishing a good relationship with your manager as there is a lot of favoritism & corporate politics "

Abbott,WAREHOUSE TECHNICIAN OPERATIONAL SUPPORT,3,"•You are constantly challenged every day to learn, grow and are constantly busy•I believe i learned leadership, essential life skills and how to work within a corporate setting•The workplace culture is one of the MOST difficult parts, I understand each place is different. You definitely learn to stand up for yourself, and how to have tough skin. Along with memorizing procedures and being thrown in with minimal training. The best way I can describe is being thrown in a pit with a lion. Many people are watching, in the hopes that you might get massacred. However you have to just go in there and try to tame the beast. •The hardest part will be the people-the job In itself and anything in between you can learn.  • The most enjoyable part was the sense of triumph you feel, after you leave or excel further in the chain. You feel as you just came back from war and are now able to do anything.Overall I’m grateful for the essential life skills this role has taught me. Understand if pursuing a career within, it will not be simple. Although if you managed to get through the benefits are worth it. "
Abbott,Analista,5,"Good benefits, excellent place to work, a lot of pressure and constant growth, flexible schedule and additional rest days to those of the law"
Abbott,Lagerhelfer,2,"As an employee in the office and from a certain salary class per se, you are well paid and treated.The further down you sit the more false promises and the more badly you will be treated"
Abbott,IT Technician,5,Excellent company. Processes very good and industry standard. Team and management was fantastic and work very varied with a office and benefits. - No negatives and remember my time fondly working at Abbott Laboratories. 
Abbott,Contract Administrator,4,Great place to work. The management was good and listen to my feedback. Colleagues are friendly and helpful. Learning a lot and work with nice people.
Abbott,Operator 2,1,I worked both locations (plymouth and minnetonka). The management is horrible. They don't care about you nor do they listen to you. Your co-workers are just as toxic and horrible as management. Getting overworked all the time AND getting underpaid. The raises suck. Having lazy co-workers who make you do all the work. The higher ups like the engineers and techs talk to you like you're stupid. Just not a fun place to work. I highly DO NOT recommend working here. 
Abbott,Estagiária,5,"The internship at Abbott gave me several opportunities to learn software, tools and so on.The work environment was very pleasant and people always so request"
Abbott,Technician,2,Seriously don’t waste your time. This company is outdated. Horrible management and HR is negligent at best. Toxic work environment. And shady ethics. Just not worth it
Abbott,Senior Clinical Trial Manager,2,"Onboarding was overwhelming (par for this type of role). Too much information to learn in the time they give. Assigned mentor answered questions about training but did not support the application of the training.  Once in the role, it was fast paced and independent. As long as you were meeting the deliverables, all was good. I found the culture professional but not warm. "
Abbott,Operario de producción,3,"The company is very good in the sense of food subsidy, transport and help to the employer, but at the opportunity of growth it costs depending on their studies, it becomes a very routine job"
Abbott,Production Team Lead,4,"Company takes attention to detail extremely importantly. Not perfect, but company is always aiming for excellence. I like the management and feel like they take you seriously as long as you're willing to put in the work. Good work ethic and good attitude is recognized."
Abbott,Co-op Engineer,4,Abbott is a great company to intern with but they are horrible with coop retention. Unless you do PDP program not likely to get a full time from coop. However the team I worked was really great and did give me a lot experience that I leverage now for other positions. They give co op a lot a freedom with projects but a lot of support from the team. 
Abbott,Software Engineer,1,Don't work here. They don't care about the safety of the employees and they will do whatever it takes for increasing the profit. They are more concerned about satisfying the shareholders than anything.
Abbott,Front line leader,1,Make copies of all emails and text messages hard copies.   Don't meet one on one with anyone.  Management doesn't listen to you or communicate with everyone. Rules change week to week.

My days fly by when I'm at work no checking the clock."
Abbott,Software Engineer,3,"I worked there several years ago and the product we were working on took so many years of development. The management changed several times, either laid off or fired. After a decade, it still is in development. Obviously, with that kind of management, there is no growth for us."
Abbott,Sales manager,2,High sales target and demanding. Good location.Changed of management cause many old staff leaving. Overall competitive salary n benefits. Hybrid working schedule.
Abbott,Operario de manufactura ,2,"They simply do not rotate you, pass two years in the same station, a bad work environment due to the leaders who are qualified to be leaders"
Abbott,Scientists ,3,It is a good place to learn and promotion is based in skin color and whom you know than how you perform!They care about only shareholders profits and they will let you go anytime and to get severance one needs to sign NCA and will prevent you from working for another company for 2 years.
Abbott,Packaging Operator,4,"On my opinion every year the company was updated in salary rise, have a good benefits giving profit share annually ,retirement,3wks vacation addition 1 when you reach 7years, negative opinion that I had experience the management turnover was to fast, sometime the company policies are not followed."
Abbott,Engineer,4,Great benefits. Interesting work. Pretty good pay. Not everyone understands what you do. A lot of off hours support calls. Worked with some really great folks. Left for a better role for my family but liked a lot of things there
Abbott,Accessioner,2,"I'd say the job is good for people who are introverts. You are in the lab all day and don't have to interact with people outside. But they do not value the people who work there. They will give you some reason to fire and replace you. If you don't mind being looked at as a replacement, then this job is for you. People do not bother you, but best believe the managers and everyone else will talk about you. Everyone talks about everyone, they are just nice to you in your face. This job is definitely not long-term. If you are a contract worker I advise you to look for something else while you are working here because as a contractor you are seen as a replacement and it will be harder for you to get a raise. BTW people who are permanent get paid 17-25 an hour. This shows you how they treat contractors. If you are a permanent worker, you have a little bit more luck to stay for a specific period of time. They will ask a lot of you and if you do more than enough work, it still will not stop them from letting you go. This job has a very high turnaround which tells you a lot about this job. You can honestly get paid more with better offers somewhere else. Plus, they pay 15$ an hour for contract workers. This is clearly not enough for the type of samples you will be handling. And if you plan on staying, you probably won't be getting a raise unless you are a permanent person.  This job is only good for people trying to get experience. Keep in mind, you can show up on time every day, do more than enough work, stay later past your shift, and even come in on days when you're supposed to be - more..."
Abbott,Toxicology Laboratory Technician,3,"Typical day is to come in check emails, then begin pulling samples to be screened.  Take out the trash from the nights shift. Then aliquot oral samples and prepare for testing.  In everything we do in the lab, we have a very solid competent team which helps one another out.  Management is not the best as they do not seem to know what we do.  So they will come and say a sample preparation is wrong and needs to be fixed taking more time out of my busy day to redo work which for all intensive purpose, is completely fine to test.  The management does not know the actual process so when they oversee us, on the rare chance they do, they do not see how streamline and coherent we are with out actual procedures.  They don't know them nor do they care to learn.  Management just seems to be in the way of our work."
Abbott,QA Executive,3,"Pros: Pretty good salary packageGood year end gifts and events here and thereYoung dynamic team Cons:Alot of hectic, can lead to blame culture at timesVery high turnover rate cause of too much prioritization on productivity and maximizing manhoursYounger colleagues can be abit unprofessional at timesToo much focus on too many things at once"
Abbott,Taguig,2,A lot of opportunity for career advancement however they have a very toxic working environment the management is not good and they are giving you a lot of task with a short deadline. They treat employees inhumane

Abbott,Administrative Pilot Program,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?I made good money, the best salary in my working life.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The fact that my job took me only 2 to 3 hours to complete and my shift was a 12 hour shift.  To this day, I still don't know who was running the show.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?I really enjoyed meeting the very many different personality / culture types and I enjoyed working with these people.What is a typical day like for you at the company?They hired 4 people to work 12 hour shifts just to take attendance in the morning.Pretty much every day was a challenge but not because the work was a challenge, but finding enough to keep me busy."
Abbott,Sales Associate,5,Good and productive culture and good salary good atmosphere  good life and work balance and take care of employee and family good advancement within job

Abbott,Supervisor,2,"Management doesn't care about you. In addition to your responsibilities, they will also burden you with their own and will constantly give you tasks. Requests are never remembered. It's always your fault. Nepotism at all levels."
Abbott,Sr. Quality Engineer,5,"I had a valuable experience working at Company, where the fast-paced environment provided continuous learning opportunities. The company’s commitment to quality was evident, fostering a culture of innovation and efficiency. My role as a quality engineer allowed me to apply and expand my skills, contributing to the overall success of the team. The collaborative atmosphere and challenging projects not only enhanced my technical expertise but also sharpened my problem-solving abilities. Overall, Company’s dynamic environment was instrumental in my professional growth as a quality engineer."
Abbott,Material Handler,3,"A lot of overtime. Known for favoritism, friends and family always getting good jobs no matter how hard you work and try to prove yourself. Good pay, especially with OT."
Abbott,MitraClip Specialist I,2,"Management communication was awful. I felt so incredibly stressed, drained, and discouraged the whole time I worked there. They put me on stations that had nothing to do with my previous job experience, and when I asked to be moved to a station/line I would excel at more (and therefore be more productive for them) they always came up with excuses and just wanted me doing the stations others didn’t want to do. They are all about numbers and allow things that should NEVER be allowed to slip by for a medical manufacturer. Lots of mandatory overtime, and honestly the only decent thing about the job was the benefits and pay were ok. There is so much more I could say, but I’ll leave it at that. Don’t recommend."
Abbott,Collections Specialist,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?the best company i ever worked at!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?nothing, everyone on my finance team was very helpful.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great, Awesome. looked forward to going to the office everyday!What is a typical day like for you at the company?Come to work do what is expected of you be helpful work as a team"

What is a typical day like for you at the company?Arrive at 6:30. Work til 4:30. Log in as soon as I got home and work until 10 or 11.
Abbott,HR Analyst,4,"Generally my workplace is nice, I have learned many new things there, had a chance to work in the international environment, to have nice benefits, however a requirement to be present in the office might demotivate."
Abbott,Production Worker,3,"Working at Abbott was a good experience overall. Learned a lot of things, met a lot of interesting people and saw the bad side of management and if you had connections you had everything. If you didn't, you got the short end of the rope."
Abbott,Assistant Product Manager,3,"- wonderful and interesting colleagues- work-life-balance for most team, depending on prevailing circumstances, working hours can be long- red tapes and resistance to change, management aren't always the most supportive- Stable and secure career with good training opportunities"
Abbott,Quality Assurance Analyst,1,Over 7 years at Abbott I held multiple positions from production to quality assurance. Over time it turned into a revolving door. They will require you to work weekends on short notice while they're under paying you. The benefits are good but you can find much better in the surroundings area. Management does not value their employees. If you don't mind being used and worked to the bone then this is the place for you. If you value time with your family and being treated like a human then you should probably look else where. 
Abbott,Legal Assistant,5,"For my Abbott it is an excellent company, very good co -workers, clear organization, empathy integrity and above all inclusive in every way"

Abbott,Operator,3,No opportunity to grow. They don't see any potential on the employee. Stuck in the same position for long time. Not benefits for temporary employees and take forever to get a permanent position.
Abbott,Operator,3,If you get good at your stations theres lots of overtime and sometimes on weekends if you like that sort of thing. Get to know your coworkers but management only cares about making quota. 
Abbott,Fill Pack Operator,2,"Favoritsm Galore. Little to no room for advancement otherwise. The front office people create rules and procedures for no reason other than they have to or are told to. There's one good Line Lead, the rest range from Spineless Micromanager to Absolute Tyrant. The Senior  FLL Openly and Privately doesn't like or trust night shift, and I have seen more than one person let go just because management doesn't like them, even if they're a good employee. Good pay, but you better wear your ""I Love My Job"" face, and keep your head down."
Abbott,Abbott Warehouse Component Handler,1,"I am working in the weekend in the warehouse and there is no management there, this is not the problem, the management from other departments is there and is spying on you checking on your breaks, and assuming that your work dedication is not enough even if you are taking a slightly longer break since the job available at that specific time is done and you are waiting for new things to come.They thing that come at your car window knocking at you is a good thing to do and threatening telling you that they will talk to your supervisor is a good thing as well, not understanding your day work, not knowing anything about you, not knowing what is going on on that specific moment, i might be in the car because i got a bad news from my family who lives in a different country? the enviorment is really toxic, full of frustrated little men."

Bristol Myers Squibb,Senior Project Manager,2,Great work life balance. Contingent workers are treated differently than permanent workers. No budget and no work. Contingents are forced to take off holiday's without pay. When projects go bad Contingents are held accountable but have no control over outcomes or decisions. All IT work is outsourced and controlled offshore.

Bristol Myers Squibb,IT Training Manager,3,"Overall, the work is good. However, the company is so focused on the future that it can overlook its people in the present. Job stability is virtually non-existent; all that's needed for you to be replaced is to have a new company aquistion, a new technology, or a new division open up in a foreign land (where they will ship your role for cheaper personnel). BMS talks about ""Who are you working for?"" to engage employees to be fruitful at work, but it fails to take care of its own people, not realizing how morally destructive their decisions can be. "

Bristol Myers Squibb,"Environmental, Health, and Safety Specialist",3,Daily work is impeded by the fact that BMS promotes mediocrity in everything they do. Leadership feign surprise when mistreated frontline workers don’t align with overpaid middle managers and then set meetings to determine why KPIs aren’t being met. 
Bristol Myers Squibb,Aseptic Operator,4,"Bristol Myer Squibb, Phoenix is an alright workplace, with a 7/10 rating in my book. If you're not working the 1st shift schedule, don't expect nice meals from the cafeteria. Also, the management here is all right but seems very top-heavy when it comes to the amount of workers vs supervisors. There are a lot of questionable decisions when it comes to the production week too. Most of the managers seem to lack knowledge about the Abraxane production schedule which makes everything take longer when important details get missed. "

Bristol Myers Squibb,"Senior Manager, Operations",4,"The people at BMS are amazing. It is difficult to promote without changing teams. There is constant reorganization. The company is very risk averse and struggles with agility. However, their commitment to helping the patient is unmatched. The science is great and the people are great."
Bristol Myers Squibb,Human Resources Specialist,2,"The company provides a false sense of security and inclusivity, but beneath the surface, you’ll find a series of managers (directors) who are incompetent, sycophantic, and prone to making unfair, baseless accusations. It is not a professional environment, and I do not recommend working there."
Bristol Myers Squibb,Assistant Marketing Digital,5,Trainer as 1st work -study company.Allowed me to meet various professions.The various services were attentive.Super canteen :).
Bristol Myers Squibb,QA ,1,Manager has no people skills and no empathy. Contract roles are treated as easily replaceable. Have to know someone in the inside to get permeancy and then the pay goes to next to nothing 
Bristol Myers Squibb,Environmental Monitoring Technician,5," At Bristol Myers I enjoyed working with others who knew what they were doing and took it serious or important. Initial I was hired as a Manufacturing Associate to perform in the cleanrooms for Cancer Research, however my Role changed to an Environmental Monitor.  My team and I, took media samples of the room(s) for microorganisms that could potentially be hazardous to the environment such as mold. I learned about cGMP, Advanced knowledge of current Good Manufacturing Procedures (cGMP), USP, EU and other global regulatory guidelines/ requirement sAbility to interpret and wr it e comple x documents .Advanced written, verbal, and interpersonal communication skills. A diverse work force from all parts of the world. Hardest part of the job waking up 2:30am or 3:30am for start time at 5:00am. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing who I am working with and different appetites."
Bristol Myers Squibb,Specialist,4,Your day is never the same. Great people to work with. Management will have aggressive deadlines but that's the case for the product they work with. Decent benefits

Bristol Myers Squibb,VP,2,BMS is a company that continues to decline.  It is no longer the great company I joined years ago.  The current executive management is terrible and the newest members are lost.  I cannot believe this is BMS.  If we are here in 3 years I'd be surprised.  Only reason I gave it a two is because I believe in the medicines and mission of the conmpany.

Management never take responsibility for their mistakes.   It rolls downhill to the workers who did what management directedWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful.   Full of micromanagement
Bristol Myers Squibb,Sr. Finance Manager,2,"BMS has unfortunately become a very toxic workplace, displacing very high end caliber employees. In doing this, they have also continue to promote other roles, while not compensating exiting roles fairly and expecting them to stay on 7+ months to train their replacements. Their severance packages are the barest minimum while expecting staff to continue to perform as if the company actually cared about them."
Bristol Myers Squibb,Director,2,"In my experience as a key leader for a merger / acquisition, BMS did not walk their talk. BMS transition leadership continually stated that they “care about their new, incoming employees above everything else,” but at the end of the day, it was impossible to get critical resources needed for success. Instead, inexperienced leaders micromanaged (usurping even more time) instead of acting as leaders—providing important culture transition training & trust building, despite their having 6 months available to do this prior to the transition activities getting under way. It is well understood that when leading a M&A, helping employees of the incoming organization transition to the acquiring company’s culture is critical to the success of any merger / acquisition. However, BMS leaders made zero attempt to do this. Instead, they micromanaged us, withheld critical resources we requested, and pushing us to burnout or near burnout. How did they do this? They put a ‘High Potential’ (aka inexperienced, but smart) leader in charge of our high stakes transition as a ‘learning opportunity.’ This was a critical error. Ill equipped for the role, this individual micromanaged &  pushed key transition team members of our (the newly acquired) organization until they became ill and / or reluctantly felt the need to resign. In other words, they said what we wanted to hear, but behind closed doors, BMS leaders made decisions that were personally and professionally devastating to staff. And these were individuals who put their personal lives on hold, dedicating themselves to the success of the transition - more..."
Bristol Myers Squibb,Assistant Scientist,4,"In my role the work life balance is great, however layoffs can happen at any time and you'll never really feel secure about keeping your job depending on the role"

Bristol Myers Squibb,Becaria acceso privado,5,It is a great company in which everyone has the willingness to help you and teach you
Bristol Myers Squibb,Senior Program Manager,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?I worked as a consultant Project and Program Manager. Some companies don't allow consultants to manage the budgets of their projects. Since this is a key metric of success I find that policy ridiculous. At Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)  I was allowed to manage my budget. In fact, I was expected to. How refreshing!! Also, the collegial and inclusive nature was great. I would have given five (5) stars except BMS has a limit to the length of time consultants (staff augmentation) are allowed to work there. This is one of the stupidest policies ever.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Some groups/managers can be very controlling when it comes to allowing Project Managers to define and develop their own WBSs and manage the level of granularity of their plans. However, this varies by group.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Collegial, academic, and professional.What is a typical day like for you at the company?There is a weekly cadence to the meetings. For a Project Manager meetings are the way to stay connected with the various groups you work with. Mondays and Tuesdays are times to engage with key team leads and collect updates on activities. Wednesday and Thursday are days to support forward progress and risk mitigation / issue resolution. Fridays are a sweep up of what remains incomplete and to prepare and publish status reports."
Bristol Myers Squibb,Manager,2,"BMS used to be a great place to at least get your foot in the door in pharma,  but not anymore. Stay far far away, which should be easy as I doubt any new roles will be posted any time soon "

Bristol Myers Squibb,Senior Customer Service Associate,5,I enjoyed my time there and knowing you are working to help with the studies and medications for cancer is rewarding.  It can be hard if you have patients calling with issues that you cannot solve for them.
Bristol Myers Squibb,Security Engineer,1,"My company was purchased by BMS. If that happens to you, just know, they do NOT care about you. You are not important to them, your processes are not important to them, you do not matter.

Bristol Myers Squibb,HR Assistant,1,"Budget cuts, mass layoffs. The more you make the more you’re a layoff target. They advertise hybrid but would ideally want you on site 5 days a week. Lots of meetings. Management is always changing. High turnover."
Bristol Myers Squibb,"Summit, NJ",1,"This company has zero work life balance, the strategy is unknown. They exhaust their employees with large work loads, expect employees to work overtime with no compensation. There is zero IT support and software used is outdated and never updated or correct, so employees need to guess and hope it is correct. Management only cares about themselves and how to get exposed for themselves. "

Bristol Myers Squibb,AD,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great, rewarding projects. I was able to feel fulfilled in the work that I did.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?There is insufficient resources and talent. There is the erroneous mindset that we can do more with less, and that's not scientifically possible. People are burned out and often do the jobs of multiple people. Roles and responsibilities are not clear. While the pay is significantly higher than most other companies, it does not sustain motivation over the long-term. Also, leadership professional development is strongly needed to better help teams govern change. While their DEIB initiatives look great on paper, they lack ""tangible"" DEIB outcomes because leadership uses DEIB as more of a checkbox than real sustainability for the company.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is fast paced, systems are outdated or inefficient, and teams lacks resources/sufficient talent. The culture is political and hierarchical.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Working from 7am to 9pm CST most days. Back-to-back meetings, daily. Most meetings are about how to approach future meetings (the meeting before the meeting). Trying to influence others to do their part or deliver on project tasks, and carving out time to work on my own tasks."
Bristol Myers Squibb,PDT,5,BMS is a great company to work for. There are plenty of opportunities for growth and advancement. The pay and benefits are top notch. Overtime is also offered in some departments.

Bristol Myers Squibb,Team Lead,3,Everyone is fun to work with.  The upper management been moving around a lot. My position is well underpaid. I found out others is making about the same as me or more.
Bristol Myers Squibb,Laboratory System Engineer,4,There is some level of flexibility in the working hours. People are not difficult to work with. The canteen food is subsidized but have less variety. Work-life balance is observed as they dont encourage you to stay late.
Bristol Myers Squibb,Gerente de Investigación de Mercados Cardiovasculares,5,"I worked in this company many years ago and I still keep great teachings and endearing friends of that time.What I liked the most was the work environment, teamwork and growth opportunities.An avant -garde and congruent company with its values"
Truist,Senior Relationship Banker,4,The leadership in my region is amazing. They make it a point for you to be heard. Hours are good. Vacation time is separate than sick time (which is paid.)
Truist,Associate Vice President,2,Good pay and incentives. Poor management. Reactive versus proactive. No work life balance. Technology and processess are not well engineering and not well developed. Get ready to work 70-80 hour work weeks. 
Truist,Universal Banker,3,"I got lucky with this job and was hired with no banking experience as a Teller. The job was great at first but about a year ago they forced all tellers to shift into a Universal Banker role.If you chose to peruse this role just know you have a never-ending list of tasks that your very likely not going to finish in the timely manner that they want. As a Universal Banker you complete Teller duties and banker roles. So not only do you need to complete retention, maintain a cash drawer, talk and care for all clients that walk in, make appointments, (which you never know if you're overlapping an appointment with another because you can't see online appointments) and more of the basic teller duties, you still need to complete all of the banker duties. Opening accounts, trying to catch up on leads, make sure you reach your daily CCG quota all while you're at the teller line.Your expected to do so much for so little, transitioning into the UB role did not come with any more money.  Your supposed to know how to complete many different maintenances on accounts but you don't have time to really sit down and learn and practice with them because your job still lays at the teller line. When you call Client Care or back office for help, my co-workers and I are always met with an attitude and ask if we read the procedures, if I was able to understand the procedures, I wouldn't be calling you now would I?This is a high-level stress job and just know you'll feel like you're never getting paid enough of the amount of work you do."
Truist,Bilingual client care,3,"bilingual make 22 handle ALL lines of business, too much work for the pay .  micromanaging management workplace unprofessional , expensive benefits not enjoyable "
Truist,Product Manager,2,"Pay is good, flexible time off is good, my teammates are great and we support one another.Leadership leaves a lot to be desired. Hard to drive projects forward when leadership is not knowledgeable about project details and doesn't understand the inner workings and processes. They care more about tracking and creating metrics which they don't understand. Leaders in different areas are louder and 'sound' like they know what they're talking about. So projects get pushed by those areas instead of being managed by  a project team."
Truist,Spanish Interpreter,1,No good place  never work in that place anymore terrible manager and rule change everyday no one feel safe in the place company is trash no work days 
Truist,Relationship Banker,2,"I worked there for almost three years and instead of being written up or any sort of disciplinary action I was fired for a simple mistake from being short staffed, having call outs, not having a manager for 6 months, and having many people in management defend your character and how much I did for the branch. Leaving me with no paycheck living by myself."
Truist,Loan Servicing Specialist,2,"Worked in the call center - it was fine for awhile, but the call volume became too much. Back-to-back calls with very angry clients throughout the day. My manager and team were amazing, but the upper management never took our concerns seriously."
Truist,Senior Relationship Banker,3,Decent pay but staffing was always an issue. The best people left and management would never promote the people they should have. Culture there was weird
Truist,Senior Relationship Banker,3,TRUIST pays well for most positions and has amazing benefits. It is a great place to learn but does not offer room for growth.  It is a high stress environment and has become more about company objectives than about taking care of the customer.  Understaffed for the volume of business in most branches. 
Truist,Relationship Banker,1,Poor management. Poor communication. Poor computer systems! You better check to see your credit reports and if your deposits makes it to your account! Mortgage system messed up too. All we can do is apologize for the shixxxxty job we do.
Truist,Wealth Client Specialist,5,Great team and workplace environment. Only left due to family relocation. They strongly supported your professional goals and worked with you to achieve them as well. 
Truist,Branch Banker III,3,This company is ok. Was grandfathered into Truist. Really will depend on the management you are in depends on the experience you will have. Hard to grow outside of branch 
Truist,BDM,4,"best company to work an you should greatly comission based no salary on time you will love it greatt work great people dont join fwjeehjadfjahfjahf,af,fnanfanf"
Truist,Branch Manager,3,Truist offer great benefits. But the seem to be heading in wrong direction. Many top executives are leaving. Many employees are not happy and they leaving the company. 
Truist,Branch Coordinator,4,Was a decent place to work.  SalesPressure wasn’t too bad and my team was great.  How much you’ll enjoy your time is highly dependent on your branch management.  
Truist,Lending Specialist,5,"Great stability, flexibility and competitive pay. Lots of opportunities within the bank to move around and find a position that best suits you. Truly no complaints! "
Truist,Senior Teller,5,Excellent company to work for. They consistently take care of their employees. I always felt valued and appreciated working with Truist. Pay and benefits are unmatched in my experience.
Truist,Spanish  Care Center Representative,2,"For a bank that says the ""cares"" for everyone, this place disappoints. Management is a joke and whenever asked an important question they just circle it. No one knows what is happening but they keep adding skills to the Spanish department without an incentive. They expect quick calls but want us to cover every single ""skill"" from all the other departments.  "
Truist,Manager,5,Great company to work for. Lots of benefits competitive pay and attentive managers. Been here for many years and though it’s had ups and downs…it is a great company to work for
Truist,Retail Division Support specialist ,4,"I loved my career and working here. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts my position was eliminated.  Great work environment and my management team was the best! "
Truist,Senior Relationship Banker,4,The leadership in my region is amazing. They make it a point for you to be heard. Hours are good. Vacation time is separate than sick time (which is paid.)
Truist,Universal Banker II,5,Competitive pay. Can’t beat the benefits. Most of the managers I’ve worked for truly care. Work life balance. Growth opportunities. Variety of roles available to match interest. 
Truist,Universal Banker,3,What is the best part of working at the company?I enjoy working for Truist because of excellent benefits and interacting and helping people What is the most stressful part about working at the company?There are constant upgrades and learning What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is good. The company is multi cultural What is a typical day like for you at the company?For the most part the day is good but can be stressful due to staffing issues
Truist,Customer Service Representative,1,I have worked here for 3 yr. Horrible systems. They are constantly reissuing cards without client knowledge. Internal issues and no care for employees 
Truist,Marketing Manager,3,A young company with old bones and kinks that haven't been worked through. Too many leaders in too many roles that good employees are the first to go when the bank isn't performing to appease the shareholders. 
Truist,CSA - Customer Service Associate,5,So far this job has been good. Not much of a training program so luckily I came in with some experience. Benefits are standard. Pay is better than where I was. 
Truist,Registered Client Service Associate,4,Flexible schedule.  Opportunity to grow if you are interested.  Competitive pay.  I genuinely enjoy working here.  The training is minimal but your work team will support you.
Truist,Director,1,"This used to be a great place to work. Ever since  the merger, things have gone downhill. Lack of upward mobility and compensation for high production roles. "
Truist,Universal Banker II,2,Feel like all the company cares about lately is sales. I love genuinely helping people when I see a need that is fit but I can’t stand when they push to get everything sucked out of them. 
Truist,Collector I,4,I enjoyed working at Truist. I just didn’t enjoy the hours and no room for growth. My manager was amazing and always very understanding. My my was amazing as well.
Truist,"Charlotte, NC",5,There are still a lot of changes happening since merger but overall a good place to work. Sales goals are high but do-able. Good pay and benefits. Really focused on technology which is pretty cool. 
Truist,Commercial relationship specialist ,1,Toxic masculinity work place. Do not recommend. Horrible leadership with no direction and support for employees. Huge turnover and insufficient training for new hires.
Truist,Senior Relationship Banker,1,"I’ve worked in banking for 15 years and Truist was the worst. Management didn’t care and employees, only hired managers based on race and none knew how to do their jobs. Manager at my location created a hostile work environment to create tension amongst employees, so we couldn’t be friends and have “distractions” by conversing. All around terrible place to work. I quit on the spot when my manager made out of line comments about my medical history, recent surgery and subsequent need for ongoing physical therapy. I would rather have no health insurance and lose mobility from not going to PT than to spend one more minute in that environment. "
Truist,Financial Analyst,3,"Like so many places, your experience will depend on your manager.  There are a lot of internal politics (as with most places), but a good manager will try to shield you from this as much as possible, so you can be productive."
Truist,Underwriter III,2,Truist is a big bank that is trying to figure out its overarching strategy.  Will take time but they need to reinvest in their teammates.  No real training for teammates in new roles and most teammates don't seem to be very engaged.  
Truist,Retail Associate,1,expected to make calls to customers after hours. No work life balance. Unreal sales goals. Management micromanages everyone. And our benefits are worthless.
Truist,Client Support Specialist,4,I appreciated the amount of PTO I received and additional days earned for years of service.  There was often professional development or the encouragement to take classes or further education or training. 
Truist,Universal Banker I,3,"Truist is a 6 out of 10. What decreases the points is the overwhelming amount of fraud, horrible upper Managment, and poor support from back office. Depending on which branch your location, staff can be limited. Which means much of the operations and customer-based transactions in the branch can fall on you. No matter what position you are in whether a universal banker(teller) or senior relationship banker, heck even a manager- you possibly will still be on the teller line. Now imagine having a banker position attempting to achieve goals while worrying about preventing fraud and trying to keep clients happy. Oh yeah the pros.... Good pay, "
Truist,Senior Accountant,3,"I joined Truist during the merger, they do have good benefits, pto( negotiate!!!), sick time, also good compensation. But everything is going downhill very quickly, constant layoffs,  forced people back to office just to justify their expense for uptown building. Managers only care to get a new role and move up, upper management gets unreal bonuses even  when they lay off people right and left. "
Truist,Universal Banker,4,"Great place to work, they are sales heavy but overall doable so far. Love the benefits, like Purchasing Vacation. And good pay overall! Happy to work here!"
Truist,Fraud Specialist,1,"Terrible management, terrible company. They treat their customers awful. I worked in fraud, once a clients money was gone that was pretty much it and they left it up to us to explain they will not be getting that money back even though it’s fraud! Management picks favorites also "
Truist,Senior Relationship Banker,4,The leadership in my region is amazing. They make it a point for you to be heard. Hours are good. Vacation time is separate than sick time (which is paid.)
Truist,Agent,4,Great  work but much micromanaging  management  not friendly or helpful and not wanting to see you successful.  Great hours and good work life balance.
Truist,Retail Team Leader,4,"This position was removed and is no longer at this bank in this area. As long as your liked and producing, you will get as much as needed. Otherwise, your put into uncomfortable positions"
Truist,Commercial Operations Specialist,4,"Company is known for continuing layoffs. Always have your resume updated. Also don’t get too excited for career advancement, unless you apply to other internal positions you won’t be moving up "
Truist,Fraud Analyst,3,Job was okay for the most part but executive management has gone downhill. Pay is mediocre at best while expecting the most work. Concerns are always asked for but never addressed. 
Truist,Branch Leader,1,"No time for lunch. 8am to 530 pm daily. No ot because salary, and doing work of 3 employees. Leader doesn’t care. HR can’t help and over a month behind on workplace incidents. Try to stay motivated, engaged, help clients and do the best you can. Hardest part is working with people that have no business working in a bank. Best part, helping client. Making a difference. Banks, TRUIST don’t recognize or reward good teammates anymore. Branches always short staffed. People hired with no experience. Company treats you like a number and will dispose of you. "
Truist,Call Center Representative,2,"Lots of yelling customers, they change your role and the job you doing every other month and they don’t upgrade your pay, very micromanaging, no raises "
Truist,Mortgage Customer Service Representative,3,"I loved my job working in the mortgage department felt I was apart of something big and was doing a great job my status was 100% but was laid off out of the blue and sent out packing. They will keep employees that are call outs and aren’t performing well over the good employees. They had great benefits, management was great and easy to talk to and willing to teach you. But you are replaceable no matter how good you think you are. "
Truist,Branch Manager,5,I enjoyed my time at Truist I did like it better when it was BB&T I miss BB&T dearly. One thing Truist can improve on is better training for new hires. 
Truist,Universal Banker,4,"The benefits are good, good work life balance and the team is close knot depending on what branch you work at. Everyone is polite, which makes for a good work environment. On the downside upper management always gives you ridiculous goals to reach. "
Truist,Network Control Help Desk,5,Working at Truist was the highlight of my career. The company was fair and and my coworkers were amazing people to work with. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone.
Truist,Data Analyst,5,"If you're looking for a company that values their employees and offers lots of room to grow, I highly recommend Truist. The work culture is positive and collaborative, and management is always looking for ways to help employees develop their skills and advance their careers. I've had a great experience working here, and I would definitely recommend it to others."
Truist,Internal Auditor,4,Good pay and work life balance. Opportunity to move up the corporate ladder if you work hard and make positive connections. Purpose driven company that drives for results
Truist,Processor,4,"At Truist, our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities. That happens through real care to make things better. To meet client needs, to empower teammates, and to lift up communities."
Truist,Analyst,3,Culture is great but a lot of hierarchies and hard to climb the ladder in the bank without having connections. Wish we had better time off and other benefits 
Truist,Universal Banker II,3,"Great place to start working in banking field, however since the merger between suntrust and BBT its hard to grow your career within the company. They overload the universal banker with so many tasks all at once in a fast pace environment. Even though the position is ""Universal Banker"" you're really just a teller. "
Truist,Teller,4,very nice company but the pay is not the best. it is a great place to start if you like the banking environment because it gives you a lot of knowledge before moving to a better position.
Truist,Mortgage Underwriter,5,"Worked 5 days a week, occasionally 1 day out of the weekend.  Remote environment was nice however hindered getting to know co-workers.  Lost job due to reduction of force"
Truist,Operation Specialist – Deposit and Payments Analyst LLL,1,What is the best part of working at the company?do not work here. They do not value the employees. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The management. These were t2 banks merged together and some of the management left over from the Suntrust do not follow protocols What is the work environment and culture like at the company?toxic and lots of favoritism involvedWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?depressed and anxious waiting to be layed off
Truist,Universal Banker II,3,Working so hard no twice 15 minutes break working straightforward only one hour lunch but doing the work of two people at the same time because of lack of hiring new people to help.
Truist,UB,3,The branch employees are great but the branch is very busy making it difficult to meet personal goals. Culture is great and everyone gets along. The benefits are excellent but expectations are impossible.                                                                   
Truist,Senior Relationship Banker,4,The leadership in my region is amazing. They make it a point for you to be heard. Hours are good. Vacation time is separate than sick time (which is paid.)
Truist,Universal Banker II,2,"I was in banking for over 25 years, and after the pandemic, it was no longer enjoyable.Truist talks a great game, and in fairness, it offers great, modern options for banking.  But as a workplace it was awful.  The company keeps on paring away locations, and then cutting back staff.  They absolutely refuse to adequately accommodate locations with high volume transactions, and as much as it hurts the clients, it hurts the staff even more.As if the staffing wasn't a problem enough, the company has extremely strict sales goals, and they will threaten termination if you try to put the needs of your clients over that of the sales goals.  They will smile at your face, but wear the same exact smile as they kick you out the door if you don't make the numbers."
Truist,Teller,5,Great place to work and be able to come to work feeling like you make a difference . Pat is okay. Employees are fun to work with and management is ok. Could be better
Truist,Branch Banker Team Leader,4,"Rewarding job and fantastic entry level position to leadership.  Truist sets the foundation for additional pathways and success.  The pay for a metro area overseeing three branches was below $50,000 and ultimately the reason quality employees leave after training. "
Truist,Designer,1,They made me go through several phases to not be hired due to lack of experience chose another candidate couldn’t provide with feedback on where to improve 
Truist,Bank teller,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great employees and service to clientsWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?When several clients are in line waiting to be assistedWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?friendly, professional,clean environment, senior staff helpfulWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Working from 9-5 and assist all clients with their banking needs"
Truist,Business Credit Analyst,4,Truist bank is a great place to work. Deal with customers who have billing issues or account maintenance.  There are 2 weekly  30 minute team meetings to discuss company updates and pococes.
Truist,Financial Services Representative,3,"The pay is nice, but the work can be stressful and there are high goals. All locations are understaffed.its pretty decent depending on your team and how well they pitch in"
Truist,Small business broker,4,Was there before Kelly King retired. I think the managers were supportive but overall direction was unclear and training was lacking. Overall I do think it’s a good company to work for.
Truist,Lead Infrastructure Engineer,2,What is the best part of working at the company?The pay and bonus structure is quite goodWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?poor upper management with constantly changing priorities.   Favor for contractors over internal SMEsWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?full-time chaos in every facet of every day.What is a typical day like for you at the company?there are not typical days.  Meeting overload and constant firefighting are the norm
Truist,Universal Banker I,3,"Things have definitely changed since the merger and so many people are leaving now that customer service is going to be offshore. Since they ""promoted"" tellers to UBs they have added 100 things but not given much of a raise other than the base $22 that gave back in 10/2022. Changed the way incentives go so quarterly bonus payouts are a lot harder to get. Really drilling SALES but the economy isn't up to par to get people interested in anything anymore."
Truist,Universal Banker,3,Upper management is completely unaware of the day to day of a branch. Sales goals are constantly pushed even though “we don’t do sales”. Pay is good but not worth the stress of management breathing down your neck and constant staffing issues across all locations
Truist,Team Lead - Asst. Manager,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?It's no best part they really do not value their employees at all What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Stepping up to be a team leader and supporting everyone meet your goals and feel all is good just for Regional managers ego is so big and controlling it goes unnoticed because it wasn't done his way but was definitely doneWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Horrible they don't care about their employees as human beings What is a typical day like for you at the company?STRESSFUL, MISERABLE, UNHAPPY the only thing that got me thru was the nice clients were treated like machines, robots and were never appreciated"
Truist,Relationship Banker,4,"The job varies greatly from one location to the next, but the new movement of the company is highly focused on client surveys rather than sales, which makes customer service the top priority of every teammate. Along with this, teammates are expected to have multiple needs-met conversations throughout each day to recognize opportunities and recommend solutions to clients. "
Truist,Universal Banker/Teller,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?The best part working at Truist is the pay..What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Meeting goals, the playing around among the employees.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Too much gossiping, too much playing around. Managers needs better training. Management should have mire then a high diploma. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Typical day it's dead silent when customers come in it is good."
Truist,Credit Analyst,4,"Nice people, although everyone is from the same few southern schools. Pay seems good for the amount you have to work. Not a bad gig for atlanta, would recommend"
Truist,Data Analyst,3,great place to work and good work life balance. pay is good and get RSU and annual bonus.  get access to meet business peoples and managers are very helpful
Truist,Sr. Banker,3,Out of date equipment and programs make everyday work slow and glitchy. Helplines have been outsourced out of the country which makes communication difficult as an employee and for clients. There are seemingly a lot of resources for employees yet movement within the company has proven to be very difficult. 
Truist,Teller,4,"Good work environment ebery branch I worked at, but every branch can be different. Pto and benefits are good, sometimes get stuck in same position for long time "
Truist,Retirement and Institutional Services Support Specialist II,1,Is you haven’t been there for 10 plus years you’re not valued. Training is non-existent and management is immature on many levels. Several massive layoffs and yet they are still hiring. Makes no sense.
Truist,Assistant Manager/Sales Associate,5,Was able to float and work in all different departments to learn all facets before moving to manager. Upper management was considerate and open to flexible schedules.
Truist,Senior Relationship Banker,4,The leadership in my region is amazing. They make it a point for you to be heard. Hours are good. Vacation time is separate than sick time (which is paid.)
Truist,Customer Service Representative Account Security and Claims,2,"Company culture created in August 2020.  Management routinely falsifies employee data, particularly related to time cards,  to either enable those who can't be bothered with the job, or to target those they do not care for (whatever reason).  HR knows this and covers for management.  Internal controls are completely lacking, and management has the aura of criminal element.  Pay is good. Benefits are great.  Seemingly a fantastic place to work, and it probably would be if they had typical bank managers.  Remote work is virtually impossible to obtain unless you go the doctor/disability/accommodation route.  If you are a favored gender/ethnicity/orientation, and don't want to work, Truist is the place for you.  Merger of equals:  2020 riots merged with Covid fraud.  It's actually far worse than i'm conveying."
Truist,Universal Banker,3,"Underpaid, not the biggest fan however it’s a great way to get into the financial world. I wouldn’t suggest it to family and friends since it can be a lot."
Truist,Universal Banker,4,"Easy job, bad clients. Management could be better like most jobs. Was a part time worker, but got to work up to 40 hours most of the year until HR said it’s not allowed. "
Truist,Human Resources Generalist,4,"Great insurance, PTO and work life balance. Modern company moving along with the current times of DEI. Hybrid work schedule and no micromanaging. Facilities could be updated."
Truist,Fraud Investigator,3,Chaotic environment and poor management. There wasn’t alot of training or cohesiveness during my 2 years with the company. Management was moved in with zero know how.
Truist,Care Center Specialty Specialist l,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Meeting some really good people.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not being trained properly, and management.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Elevator was always broken. Refrigeration was so dirty you couldn't put hour food in itSimply ghetto.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful, they said one thing and did another. Severely Micromanaged. Coaching are actually write ups."
Truist,Call in Teller,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?They were still in the transition of BB&T and becoming Truist when left.  So to be honest I am not sure how the Company has changed since Oct, 2022What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The pressure the management put on you to finish the classes the company made mandatory you take. Not through a school or any classroom setting but refreshing classes they thought everybody needed.  Which I turn is a wonderful idea on paper but not when you really don’t have to time to fit it in your everyday routine.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Business, professional always astute and aware.  The culture is always thinking about the client and ways of helping them making their money grow.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Helping the clients the best way possible! Not matter what their need may be we are always there to help them with whatever or however their financial situation may be."
Truist,Relationship Banker,1,"Horrible Management, they micromanage in every aspect and level of the company, they don’t care about life work balance way too focus on their own goals and sales tactics. They lost site about their own clients, customers employees and all their care was about their profits and market shares. Company lost site for what they are really want to stand behind and their own culture changed especially after the merger they are focus way too much on pushing sales and products towards their employees throats so they can push down to their own clients their standards got lowered just to accomplish their goals and did not care who is affected by it. They lost and kept loosing great talent employees and even their own clients and customers were leaving in insane numbers due to their culture and focus."
Truist,Adjuster,3,It was all except for my supervisor. It was like you had to be perfect or they were on you all the time. I was a top agent but was treated like I had no idea what I was doing. 
Truist,Manager,4,It was a good place to work. Growth presents challenges. Learned a lot from the experience and had good leadership there. Enjoyed give back community projects and community involvement projects. Workplace culture was collaborative and cooperative. 
Truist,Loss Mitigation Specialist,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Very professional and was able to do more production work involving reviewing for errors and recommendations What is the most stressful part about working at the company?No stress involved because I enjoyed my work and team What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Always driven for completion and willing to assist with questionsWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Log in, review task for the day; do follow up, begin new reviews"
Truist,Manager,5,"The company has great local support in the branches and good overall intentions for the customers they serve. The company is still moving thru growing pains from merger, but moving in a positive direction. "
Truist,Virginia,5,Great place to work direct manager is amazing.  While a lot of work and dispute others our area is amazing and manager values us as teammates. Wish some things didn’t change but really like what I do and my coworkers
Truist,Loan Servicing Specialist,3,"There’s good and there’s bad. I enjoy my manager’s style of leadership. I think a universal banker is a bad idea and puts pressure on the teammate, and they send jobs overseas which is fine, but the service the client receives is not consistent."
Truist,Relationship Banker,4,"Just not enough staff and too many duties to everybody, gets really stressful and overwhelming But also great opportunity for career growth if you can deal with anxiety attacks"
Truist,Credit Card Specialist,1,"On top of being terrible place to work the management in the contact center have favoritism. Overall the expectations were unrealistic. Stay away if you want a long term job, they’ve fired multiple positions just to cram it into ONE. I truly wish they never merged to become truist. "
Truist,Universal Banker,1,"All branches are short staff, bad managment. If you are a banker and they dont have a teller then you have be in the teller line and still expected to do your daily numbers."
Truist,Customer Service Representative,3,Decent pay bad management. Worked in contact center for 1-3 months before working remote full time. Truist adjusted starting pay for all positions $22 a hour 
Truist,Teammate Banking Lending Specialist,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The teamwork and the culture in general. I worked in several areas of Truist and they all were the absolute best experiences of my careerWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Can't think of anything at this momentWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Amazing! Great opportunities for young professionals!!What is a typical day like for you at the company?Fun and busy . Focus on our clients needs and really helping them to grow and meet their goals was very rewarding
Truist,Financial Advisor,4,It's a good company to work for. Goals are high and unrealistic. I did enjoy the work environment. Benefits are pretty solid. Overall I enjoyed my stint there.
Micron Technology,Software Engineer,4,The pay is good with good benefits. The management has lots of different programs to help you with any need. Micron does offer a lot of stock each year.
Micron Technology,Process Engineer,3,"The benefits are good, but the work will be very demanding. Overall it’s still a good place to learn for fresh graduates. Promotion might be depending on boss"
Micron Technology,Electrician,4,I have nothing to complain about the company but the office location is so so packed and there is no windows that make all of the employees feel like working in warehouse 
Micron Technology,IT Software Engineer,4,The company benefits are good and great if you can get stock options. Work life balance wasn't good. MFG IT is a hot mess but that just means lots of work and room for improvement. Overall a good company to work for.
Micron Technology,Intern,4,"Fun working culture, many employee benefits and good pay BUT stressful (especially NPI or dry etch), and directors very old-style  (asian boss mindset). Culture really depend on team and direct manager"
Micron Technology,DRAM Design Engineer Intern,5,Great people and relatively relaxed workspace. Learned a lot from many experienced engineers. Work was pretty interesting for the most part and not too difficult. 
Micron Technology,Administrative Assistant,3,Excellent culture and pay just wasn’t what I was looking for long term. I would highly recommend to others that are looking for a company to start in the industry.
Micron Technology,Hardware Engineer,4,Work Timings could be more flexible. Team members were supportive and approachable.Friendly environment and we could take short breaks whenever necessary.
Micron Technology,Test Engineer,2,"Culture and environment is stress and not friendly as everyone only care about own and the bosses also not helpful keep on question  and blame on the new hire. As new hire hard to adapt to the environment. Workload is alot and not reasonable , not as good as outside view. Last time paid is not as high as now when enter in the year of 2020."
Micron Technology,Data Scientist,4,"Work life balance is great in data science team. You have to do a lot of things other than data science related. For example, you have work on building an application (front end and back end) and You'd also train process engineers how to use the application. We don't have enough business process analyst s and software engineers so data scientists need to do all of that stuff. the work hour is flexible and you can take annual leaves easily. Overall I think it is a good place to work. "
Micron Technology,Engineer,4,"Colleagues are very friendly, there;s politics, if you're not too ambitious it is okay. Lunch subsidy and a lot of perks. A lot of team building events "
Micron Technology,CNC Mill Set Up Operator,3,Waited for work for long periods often.Management was very unorganized.They were nice but not always very helpful it wasnt a bad place to work just not very organized.
Micron Technology,Senior Manager,1,"First thing there has no work life balance anf toxic working environment. The way they manage the manufacturing is not following the industrial standards, but with their own way, you will found they are disconnected with the world in many things. "
Micron Technology,Validation Engineer,5,"Very stimulating, quiet and helpful colleagues, a lot of flexibility with possible remote work.Good pay with meal vouchers included.Closed parking for employees and there is the canteen"

However, this is common in the semiconductor industry."
Micron Technology,Project Manager,4,I worked at Micron for 15 years before my wife's job had us move to a different state. I really enjoyed my time there. In the 15 years I had 5 different jobs in 2 different departments. There is ample room for promotions if you apply yourself. I would learn something new almost every day and was excited about the projects I was working on. Under different managers I would have non flexible work schedule or a flexible schedule were I could work from home or come in at different times. Was at the current managers discretion. There are good managers and there are bad managers there just like most companies.
Micron Technology,Product Engineer,5,Management is good but salary is really low for old employees.New hires get more salary than long term working employees. I am saying atleast they should make it comparable.
Micron Technology,Equipment Engineer,4,"Great place to work, but as intern they don't really pay too much attention to you. you will be given tasks and when completed you must report if you want to keep yourself busy. no one comes and assigns you a task"
Micron Technology,Equipment Engineer,4,"Pay and benefits were good, but OT was cut off when company was not doing well. Job progression might not be the best, but good for a fresh grad who is in it for the money."
Micron Technology,Engineer,4,"Lots to learn and good support for people just join the semiconductor industry. Good life work balance, good benefit. Management can be very different, depending on the group and BU. "
Micron Technology,Software Engineer,4,The pay is good with good benefits. The management has lots of different programs to help you with any need. Micron does offer a lot of stock each year.
Micron Technology,Equipment Technician,5,No hard demands to work outside your normally scheduled work shift. Enjoy most holidays off or receive paid time off for holidays worked. A great way to accumulate time off quickly.
Micron Technology,Quality Engineer,5,Great employee benefits and learning  opportunities.But very competitive and less work life balance. Great place for freshers and personnels looking forward to building career in MNCs
Micron Technology,Software Engineer,3,"Amazing place, never had any issue and got a double promotion 4 years into my current role; some would say it was overdue but a fair process was followed."
Micron Technology,Process Engineer,3,Expect to OT everyday depending on process stability. Slow increment. Unable to take pictures inside the company. Bosses can be micromanaging as well.
Micron Technology,Manager,5,Good job and amazing company. Very happy to be here and this is the best company to work in. Thank you and have a good time. I end my review here h thank youwit
Micron Technology,Technician,5,"Good bosses, benefits, and co-workers -  but got tired of 12 hour shifts. Work three in and four off from 6pm to 6am.  Paid to take classes a great bonus. "
Micron Technology,Gas Technician,4,"Worked at Micron 8 years. In that time wages barely paced with inflation and advancement was reserved for the politically connected. They went way overboard with Covid, which meant they couldn’t afford to pay everyone when the Covid funding dried up. On the other hand, benefits are good. "
Micron Technology,Engineer,2,Management talks negatively about employees with others behind their backs. Employees hours/shifts are often changed without notice and don't provide work/life balance. Night or evening shifts are common.
Micron Technology,Machinist,5,Enjoyed my time there. Fast paced with state of the art equipment. Tools supplied and helpful team dynamic. Dept moved to Utah which ended my time there.
Micron Technology,Process Technician,3,I loved working here at first we used to get free lunches and great incentives. But now it seems like they really pulled back on what made this company fun and added more stress. You can’t guarantee you will keep your job here but you can guarantee that you will have to over work to keep up with demand. 
Micron Technology,Program Manager,2,"The hardest part of the job is the migratory culture. The company hires crazy amounts of contractors, tells them there is potential for perm FTE, then doesn’t deliver. Contractor life makes you feel a temporary part of the team here. It does not feel like management is invested in you or your growth, just your tasks."
Micron Technology,Manager,5,"Hybrid work schedule, flexible arrangement of calls, generally good working relationship with peers. Some difficult employees here and there, but managable."
Micron Technology,Process Control Intern,4,Colleagues were very welcoming and there was ample time for you to learn about the job scope. Manager was quite understanding as well and compensation was great for an intern
Micron Technology,Process Engineer,5,"Great culture, and great place to work. Absent of toxic culture typically found in the semi conductor manufacturing space. Supportive teammates and management. "
Micron Technology,Process Engineer,2,Starting pay for entry level process engineer is good. And luckily I am in a team whereby not much office politics is involved. However the work life balance is nonexistent despite efforts being done to reduce off hours triggers.
Micron Technology,Production Worker,3,"Expect to work with people who don't respect management and expect management to not give a shoot.-Gaslighting culture highly promoted, if you aren't part of it. Expect to be left out and eventually let go-Expect to be just a number, no matter how hard you work. When it comes time to making cuts even though they made billions. They will cut you and hire cheaper work.-Expect your position to dropped eventually, they have been consistently restructuring. They want old out cause of their pay scale and wanting fresh lower pay individuals to do the same job. "

Micron Technology,Test Probe Central Engineer,1,They tried to make me quit.             I did not enjoy working there.   The work was ambiguous.   My boss told me it would take a year to learn enough to be productive.Given some ambiguous task.   Looked at what others had done previously for the same task.   Did the  same for the task and was told it was not sufficient without knowing why.

Micron Technology,Global Marketing Manager,4,"Talented teams with a passion for delivering exceptional products and campaigns. Growth can be hard and very dependent upon the relationship you have with your manager. They don’t always take the time to understand each role or find ways to better support the teams at times. C suite is very transparent about market conditions and the effect on business, and they do what they can to help keep people excited about the future growth of the business."
Micron Technology,Layout Designer,5,Good company with high end products and services.They make all kind of semiconductors and hardware.Good pay and compensation.Management could be better.Officr work

Micron Technology,CEO,4," How to Describe Company Culture Before we get into the specific words to use when talking about workplace culture, let’s take a step back and first discuss how to accurately describe your company culture. STEP 1: LEAN ON YOUR CORE VALUESTo start, refer back to your company’s core values. These are the driving force behind your culture and dictate how you treat employees, clients and generally do business. Additionally, your core values should describe the working style in the office. For example, as a company that values innovation, you might work to create a collaborative culture where employees are encouraged to share ideas with one another. STEP 2: INCORPORATE YOUR MISSION STATEMENTYou’ll also want to think about your company mission statement when describing your workplace culture. What is the overarching goal of your company, and how do you envision achieving it? Who is your target audience made up of, and how will you make an impact in society? Let’s say your company aims to be on the cutting edge of the e-commerce technology sector — you’ll want to create a daring company culture that encourages risk-taking. Your mission statement should give meaning to your core values and infuse your company culture with purpose."

Micron Technology,Test Engineer,4,"This job offer looks good.But it has long working hour but low salaryAlso, you will lose your career growth.But it's stable position so, you don't need to worry about being laid off."
Micron Technology,Software Consultant,2,"Management is terrible, most senior staff is awful except for a few. One of those places where if you don't give input and just coast, you are valued, if you like to pitch in and have opinions/suggestions, you are on the chopping block. I believe everyone should go through a job like this though, it teaches you lots of valuable lessons. Also, you will know what you want after working here and understand the industry as a whole much better. Benefits are good, promotions and raises are not, Micron is cyclic and goes through layoffs every 3-4 years so be prepared for that as well."
Micron Technology,Foremen ( Technical Specialist ),1,What is the best part of working at the company?Gym to workout n keep fit n sane.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Toxic environment that encourage individual performance over team ..What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Blame game where one shifts accuse the other of poor planning n execution when weekly targets are not met What is a typical day like for you at the company?Just waiting to get off work.
Micron Technology,Process Engineer,3,"Good place for learning, but fast paced due to high complexity of new products and processes, might be required to OT from time to time.  Colleagues are willing to provide help and guidance when required"
Micron Technology,Data engineer ,3,There is language bias especially in Hyderabad office. This affects your promotions and hikes as well. Salaries are low compared to competitors. Work life balance is good.
Micron Technology,Engineering Manager,1,"There is no shortage of problem solving, urgent customer deliverables/shipments, supplier challenges, and quality and reliability fire fighting.  So work days are busy and long, which can be a good thing.  But there are endless repeated mistakes.  The company is never satisfied with your work; they always squeeze you for greater productivity and better results.  And despite their claims, the company is not loyal to anyone.  Job satisfaction with experienced employees has never been lower, attributable directly to the new culture established by the current CEO."
Micron Technology,Senior Engineer/Team Lead,4,Good place to work and relatively good management and company culture. Fast pace working environment  but the leaders care about the team to make sure we have the required resource

Micron Technology,Operations Engineer,4,Good first job out of college.  Salary was about median for engineers in Semiconductor when I first started there.  Now the pay is much more substantial and they give stock options .  Downside is semiconductor industry can be quite cyclical and layoffs happen often

Micron Technology,Business Analyst,4,It has been a good experience working in the company. Salary is always on time and new office infra is also good. Because of global team structure working hours are not fixed but overall it is not a stressful environment 
Micron Technology,Firmware Engineer,5,"I have been working in micron for years and I must say that over time the company has been able to increasingly increase the quality of the employees' work life as well as the quality of the work.The context is stimulating and at the same time collaborative, this means that there is a strong sense of group and belonging.Relations with colleagues are exceptional."
Micron Technology,Senior process integration engineer,3,"Business unit is not good so market penetration badExpect senior leader to know less than you so you need to guide them most of the timeMemory business is difficult time-to-time, expect retrenchment"
Micron Technology,Industrial Engineer,5,Great culture and environment. Except during layoffs. You obviously get more work after people are laid off and it seems like everyone is for themselves from that point on.
Micron Technology,Process Engineer,3,good pay but no work life balance. tons of workloadhelpful colleague and workplace culture is not bad temporarily no OT pay and bonus 
Micron Technology,Manufacturing Technician,3,"Micron used to be a great place to work, but over time they did what every other giant company has done. As the world around them changed, they understandably cut costs, had multiple layoffs, and when things improved, they brought back less and less of what made them great to work for in the first place, which included higher bonuses, recognition, perks, etc. This brought out the worst in some people over time, especially management.I had over 8 supervisors in the 15 years I was there. Some absolutely amazing and some terrible. Ones that stood up for the team, while others basically just caved to upper management, while we took the brunt of all the bad, where we felt that no matter how hard we tried, it was never good enough. It sometimes brought out the worst in people and created an environment where toxicity thrived. Some people capitalized on the situation with favoritism, taking advantage of others when it was to their own benefit.Don't get me wrong, the job itself was really good. It's fun, fast-paced, and the compensation and benefits are decent for the industry and the area, but it's really the management that brought it all down. That's one of the main reasons I left. The constant micromanaging, with the overly critical focus on every little thing we did wrong, while completely ignoring most of the times things went great. Most days I would come in already stressed out, worrying about what they were going to criticize us for next. I could go on and on.My experience there really depended on the supervisor I had at the time. The job itself is good and there are - more..."
Micron Technology,Engineer,4,Pro: colleagues are helpful and friendlyStrong team bondingBasic benefits are coveredSubsidized lunch in canteenCons:Salary below market rateLittle salary increment
Micron Technology,Process Engineer,4,good and fun place to work at. good worklife balance and care for its employees. will recommend. good benefits and opportunities                        
Micron Technology,Operator,3,"Worked there for 1.5 years. Checked in every morning for my shift, loaded product and recorded details, wash, rinse, and repeat for 12 hours. Not terrible but very repetitive."
Micron Technology,Engineer,2,Good in speaking will lead you to a better career path. Good in technical will lead you to a better pay. It is really depend on what you choose. Good luck to you all.. 
Micron Technology,Production Supervisor,5,"Started as an Operator and had so much encouragement and support from Management to progress my future further to a Lead and eventually a Supervisor.  15 years was a good run.  Great people, time off and benefits. "
Micron Technology,Manufacturing Engineer,5,"I think company is relatively good if you don't have high expectations. progression mimics economy i think, better the economy, the more progression you can expect to have. "
Micron Technology,Engineer,5,"Bad culture and really depends on your department to see if you get a good or bad boss. A lot of OT to do if you wanna earn money, but heard that they have cut OT pay already"
Micron Technology,Technician,3,"It was okay, a lot of work with not a lot of training. Everyone was too focused on their own work. Management wasn’t great, didn’t like how everything was organized. "
Micron Technology,Maintenance Technician,5,"Management is very helpful, lots of training to make you confident at work.Lot of overtime if you wish to do. State of art facility, lot of perks. Discount for foods.."
Micron Technology,Engineer,3,"Big name to have on your resume as a company but extremely poor work culture. Very toxic and inhuman. Everything is urgent, everybody is in rush. Working like robots without any actualy contribution. Everyone working in Micron wants to leave the company at some point."
Micron Technology,Software Engineer,4,The pay is good with good benefits. The management has lots of different programs to help you with any need. Micron does offer a lot of stock each year.
Micron Technology,Production Operator II,5,Interesting job you won't find anything like it around. Pay is not the best for the industry but great for the area. Great opportunity for advancement.
Micron Technology,Data Analyst,3,What is the best part of working at the company?Compensation is good for new hiresWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?High workload and meetings at all hours due to globally dispersed workforce. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work environment and culture depends significantly on which department you work in. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Meetings starting as early as 6 am and running as late as 10 pm with some hours to work in between.
Micron Technology,Engineering Manager,3,Don't think that your seniority or dedication to the company will matter when layoff time comes (which it will).   You are just a number and expendable.
Micron Technology,IT Engineer,5,A lot to learn from Micron.Project wise.Product wise.Technology wise.Process wise.Management wise.Thanking Micron for the great opportunity. We will meet again.
Micron Technology,Data Entry Specialist (Contract),4,"I enjoyed it for the most part. Was very nice comfortable place to work and worked great with schedule. They had standing desks in the new building, exercise facility, great food in the cafeteria. Management was nice to work with and was good at giving direction but wasn’t micromanaging. "
Micron Technology,Capacity Planning Engineer,4,Bonus and OT allowance frozen due to industry-wide downturn but workload and expectation remain high.There are several routine tasks to be done weekly that seem quite meaningless in my opinion but management places great emphasis on them.
Micron Technology,Technician,3,I worked for micron for 15 years. Had a great schedule but pay was not great. You have to get accustomed to people being laid off as well and expect that it will eventually happen to you. 
Micron Technology,Machinist,5,Excellent company to work for. Good prospects if you show ability. Everyone appears to be very focused and goal orientated. Pleasant working conditions. 
Micron Technology,CMP MDE Intern,5,"I worked as one of the lowest-paid interns at the company (based off of what my intern colleagues were making) but the work was still quite good.Micron has a very well-established intern program and as far as I can tell most interns get to have great learning oppurtunities, and many of the projects we got to work on made valuable impacts to the teams we were working for.Overall, the workplace is quite lax as long as you get your work done; it's not toxic, it's not very stressfull, it's quite nice! The only complaint I can make is that the people are a bit quiet, but that is a just an opinion. Overall, it won't pay as well as some of the other internships, but it is the best one can ask for when accounting for work-life balance, benefits (there are quite a lot of benefits), and location."
Micron Technology,QA Engineer,3,"Good exposure, micro management, good pay good bonuses. Fast volume fast money culture, new site  no core value, fast growth. No work life balance.   "
Micron Technology,Data Science Engineer,3,"Opportunity to learn lots from colleague and explore new projects within manufacturing sector.However, some management roles do not come from data science background, thus expectation might be not logically"
Micron Technology,Process Engineer Intern,5,"Would love to work here in the future! Lots of nice co-workers, great learning opportunities and room to grow. Facilities are very nice and has a great atmosphere."
Micron Technology,Tax Accountant,2,Management doesn’t care about team members. The turnover rate is about 50%. Most new hires stay until their 401k match has vested and then leave. The CFO is so far removed from the tax department and hasn’t addressed the high turnover rate. 
Micron Technology,Material Handler,2,Management is horrible as well as some of the co workers throw their work load onto you. Management is super strict on being on time does not matter if you are doing a good job on finishing your workload. If you are not on time they will fire you on the spot. 
Micron Technology,Project Manager/Candidate experience specialist (contract),2,What is the best part of working at the company?The opportunity to work on multiple projects was awesome and a great learning experience. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not knowing when the company is going to randomly layoff large portions of its workforce. It’s a patternWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Worked from home so it was amazing. There was the option to use office space if needed What is a typical day like for you at the company?Laid back and easy going responding to emails and requests from after hours before jumping into project tasks
Micron Technology,Operation & Maintenance Technical Specialist,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Facilities Maintenance and Operations What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Micron is free stressful company.

Micron Technology,Project Manager,5,I've heard a lot of good things about Micron and interested to learn more.  They are building a huge chip fab facility near where I live and think it would be an excellent opportunity to explore.
Micron Technology,Senior Yield Enhancement Engineer,3,Pros:High pay for fresh graduatesGreat collaboration between inter department teamsCons:Always need to prove self innocents rather than focus on the problemsFast pace and need OT to complete work even without OT pay currentlyPoor work life balance 
Micron Technology,Manufacturing Technician,4,"Micron is a great place to work.  I worked there for over 10 years. The culture is diverse and they treat everyone equally. Coworkers are professional. It's a facepace environment work place. Can be very stressed sometimes trying to catch up with demanding. I worked 3 days and off 4 days and then work 4 days off 3 days. 12 hours shift work. If your work schedule is on holiday, they will pay you 1.5 times. "

Progressive,Customer Service Representative,3,"Everyone was very nice and the training felt thorough, but after training it was clear that not all info was covered; it was a little stressful. Pay matched the job duties."
Progressive,Claim Examiner,2,They sneak you in like they'll hold your hand and then throw you to the wolves. Want you to be on the phone more than humanly possible and expect so many different tasks you haven't been trained for.
Progressive,Adjuster,4,Pretty heavy workload and stressful at times. Almost wish they paid more. Some customers are very rude but that’s life. Overall ok. Opportunities to move up but very competitive 
Progressive,Construction Clean Up,1,The work that was done I loved what was not good is in charge of the very heavy group had preferences with an employee and always walked with her everywhere and let me alone did all the work of the two since we were only I andThe one that was always with the bone manager formed the other always was late too and when I worked to do things without joke and me heavy
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,1,"The claims load once you are months in become unmanageable. You become salary once you graduate onboarding and 8hrs is not enough time to complete your work. The work/life balance is horrible, but it’s your choice to work over or not. If yo do not work more than 8hrs a day, you will fall behind. The expectations are unrealistic."
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,5,Great benefits working here. They really care about their employees. They are kind of flexible with hours and allow independence when working to code what you want to work on and when. 
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,3,The culture is great but the back to back calls can take a toll on you. Training is very thorough and there is always someone to assist you if you did need help.
Progressive,Sales Representative,3,"The benefits are decent and the perks include flexible scheduling, decent pay, licensing and good team members but the long hours are exhausting and so is the back to back calls non stop. You only get 15 seconds between calls. Promotions are more difficult than they make it seem in the beginning. It is pretty metric driven and you will be pushed to make sales without commission quite a bit. This wasn’t my first remote job but it definitely was the hardest mentally. "
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,2,"I was in the CSR role for two years. The pay is decent, depending the area you live in, it's  remote, generous pto and flexible scheduling. Those are pretty much all the perks. It's back to back calls all day and almost all week. Getting screamed at/disrespected by the customers was an everyday thing. It just starts to get draining and takes a toll on you mentally. You start dreading having to log in. Don't recommend it long run, maybe just for a few months."
Progressive,MLR,4,"Good company, room for advancement, decent benefits and work life balance. Lots of support, team environments and yearly raises and bonuses based on company productivity "
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,1,You get 7 new claims a day some days you will be working to midnight just to catch up. Management is not nice to you they think about themselves only. 
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,3,It's a typical insurance job. Good culture in the building but they clearly want people to work from home. Lots of training and information if you need it. 
Progressive,Sales Representative,3,"They really go out of their way to make you feel like part of the company and there is a pretty nice work culture. However it's not a good job if you have anxiety. You will get yelled at a lot by customers, and the push to cross sell products never feels natural to you or the customer. Some people in management or supervisor roles can be way too hard on employees."
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The culture.  Everyone is very helpful and friendly.  Upper management is understanding when issues arise.  What is the most stressful part about working at the company?I'm a claims adjuster and at times the claims can become overwhelming.  Days can turn from 8 to 12 hours a day easily.  What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Friendly, lively, educating, and refreshing What is a typical day like for you at the company?Start at 8am, listen to voicemails, return them, start working on my initial claims, take statements, order police reports, follow up on claims.  Definitely take a lunch and enjoy the sun and chatter with friends.  Wrap up my day by 6pm, maybe 6:30pm"
Progressive,MRR,4,"Management is very accommodating and flexible with PTO. The workload can be overwhelming, but they don’t expect you to complete everything right away. "
Progressive,Financial Reporting,1,"Toxic environment with work clicks. Absolutely little to no training, expected you to ""know"" the system even if you never worked on it. Manager would frequently berate you if you made a mistake. "
Progressive,Claims specialist,5,"Great place to work. Felt like family. I hated leaving, but family called. They really care about developing the individual. If you are a self starter and motivated, you won’t go wrong. "
Progressive,Sales Representative,5,Best Job Ever! I love working for Progressive the managers is great! Flexible schedules. PTO is great! I love the company and it’s a great place to work.
Progressive,Bodily Injury Claims Adjuster,3,"High volume workload, dealing with customers and shops can be overwhelming. The workload never stops as claims constantly are happening. Good advancement and pay. Management struggles to answer questions and makes you figure it out on your own. "
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,5,"Great company to work for, room for growth, also will pay for licensing. Be prepared to put in the work but it’s well deserved. Pto benefits paid time off "
Progressive,Senior Claims Adjuster,4,The KPI’s were unmanageable. You go from the training amount of claims to the full load with no warning and then get blamed for being behind. Any time you ask a regular degular question you get directed to the handbook instead of being told what it is even if you state you are currently on the phone and need an immediate answer. Other departments that you work with often are rude and unprofessional. The managers say they are here for you if you need any help but they are not they write you up in a heartbeat.
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,3,"Everyone was very nice and the training felt thorough, but after training it was clear that not all info was covered; it was a little stressful. Pay matched the job duties."
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,2,"There are some lovely people in training and middle management, but upper management and HR are awful.As for the job itself, many of my coworkers were on anxiety medication due to the the mental load and burnout."
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,3,"I was able to provide them with great customer service, but had to change careers because of the management I was in during the time which changed constantly"
Progressive,Property Adjuster,4,"Management not consistent…Certain managers micromanage excessively, focus on reports only rather than consider the human aspect and openly say they expect perfection. Meanwhile other managers let adjusters do their jobs and help their team thrive.Pay was decent and gain share was something to look forward to."
Progressive,Bilingual Insurance Agent,5,"I was in the Spanish bilingual department and let me tell you, the managers and higher ups are super understanding and very accommodating. I got hired at 6 months pregnant and they worked with me and my doctors appointments. I was work from home (FL). The training was intense (3 months)! Lots of information to learn so pay attention. I love that the training was hands on, lots of role play and we got to take live calls at the end of every study week for whatever new material we learned. So by the time we entered production floor, the agents were ready to go. Honestly, such a great company. The bilingual department is growing, so lots of room for everyone to move up the ladder! The benefits, pay, gain share, and perks are amazing!! It is a call center job for a huge company, so be prepared for constant calls throughout your shift, but hey that’s the role you’re applying for! Make sure to meet your metrics as well. "
Progressive,Commercial Lines Bodily Injury Adjuster,5,"Progressive has a really good work culture from the CEO down to management in most departments. Claims are stressful, but my manager was very supportive and made the day-to-day duties easier to complete. I would recommend working at this company based on the tremendous support alone! In my time with the claims department, I would receive annual raises and would also be eligible for promotion within 6 months to a year. The company always have a yearend celebration for the companies' profits and gainshare is a huge thing for all employees. The only reason I decided to step away was because being a claims adjuster can be very stressful. I highly recommend Progressive!"
Progressive,Telemarketer,3,"Company provides regular communication, listen to and consider new ideas, and continually encouraging growth, both personally and professionally- Company understands work-life balance and actually respects that- Culture is conducive to creating friends and mentors with lots of opportunities to get involved based on your interests- You get to work with top thought leaders in several industries -- smart, collaborative, willing to share (you typically don't get such easy access and support)- Our clients are top name brands and we are doing incredible things that impact the way business is done across the world. That's powerful! (and fun to be associated with) - This is a place you can call home; many employees have been here a long time whichallows deep integration into the business and the "
Progressive,Bilingual Customer Service Representative,5,Good company to work for extremely flexible with scheduling and great opportunities for growth even after 6 months of employment. Supervisors are very encouraging and will help you get promoted.
Progressive,Bodily Injury Claims Adjuster,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?They present themselves as family oriented however are very unstructured and do not have set expectations of job requirements What is the most stressful part about working at the company?What they expect of you will always change to a point where they make it extremely hard to succeed without working an insane amount of hours. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful, unmanageable, expectations of what is required continually changes Workload is extremely unmanageable unless you put in extra hours What is a typical day like for you at the company?Knowing no matter the amount of work you put in it will not be good enough, feeling at any moment the company will fire you because the workload is unmanageable, numerous employees dealing with health issues due to the stress placed on you by the business"
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,2,Difficult work. Most people you encounter are angry for multiple reasons. Body shops are angry. Claimants are angry. Insureds are angry. No one is happy about speaking to a claims adjuster. 
Progressive,Endorcement Specialist,2,IT Department is the best to work in. Don't ever work in Underwriting Department. They micro managed so much and don't care if you have health issues. Their HR representative is rude and belligerent. 
Progressive,Claims Specialist,4,"Overall, a great place to work. Good company culture and bonus structure. Heavy claims volume. Your experience will vary greatly depending on your direct supervisor - My experience ranged from Amazing to Awful, for the same role, depending on my supervisor. "
Progressive,Medical Representative Associate,5,"Great place to work. Leadership is always available to help, workload is reasonable. Flex Time is available for salaried employees. Great work life balance "
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,5,Handling auto claims from start to close of claim. Investigate and properly examine claims. After 6 months you receive any where 6-12/ day. Challenging at times. Great benefits 
Progressive,Customer Service Associate,1,No work life balance due to insurance business and would never approve PTO due to business needs. Unable to get time off phones for mental breaks due to rude and nasty customers upset due to insurance premium increase which we have no control. Clients were abusive and you were just told to not take it personal and push to retain clients when all they want was to lower premiums.
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,2,"I had heard from someone in the customer service department how great working for Progressive was. I applied in the only department available at the time which was claims. Interview process was normal and over video chat/phone. Once hired I did the training where the national instructors say it takes about 6-8 months to be fully adjusted to the position. Was written up by month 3 straight out of boot camp for performance and by month 6 was fired. Was told my case volume was too high though when I got transfered to another manager, I saw people on the team had much higher case loads then me though they were not on any corrective action paths to termination. I was singled out. Not sure why. And didn’t stick around to find out. Avoid claims department, as the management here are the type of people to smile you right out the door. "
Progressive,Commercial Lines Claims Adjuster Sr,4,"I have had a great time working for Progressive. They treat their employees with dignity and respect. The workload is demanding and you will feel like you earned your money. That being said, the compensation and benefits offered are very generous. I would recommend working at Progressive to anybody who is motivated and looking for a challenge. Almost 4 weeks of PTO to start plus holidays. The pay is comparable to their competitors and plenty of room for professional growth. "
Progressive,Customer Service Consultant,4,What is the best part of working at the company?The best thing for me is being able to work from homeWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Being on the phone with constant calls. Also having to sell products and services when you aren’t in the sales department.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?I work from home but we have zoom meetings. They are helpful.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Taking calls from start to finish of shift. Lunch breaks and 2 fifteen minute breaks
Progressive,Managed Repair Representative,3,I worked for progressives for almost 3 years. I had two roles one as a claims adjuster remote and one as a manage repair representative. As a MRR or manager repair representative I was basically a field adjuster for the automotive side of things. You have a lot of free time during the day as long as your get your assignments done. Depending on your supervisor approvals for estimates can take hours days or weeks. Sometimes I’d be so backlogged just because I couldn’t get anything approved and I’d have to go back to a shop who was now upset with me because I couldn’t provide an estimate . This quickly can turn into a huge problem. Guidelines rules and how things work constantly change. Where you work constantly changes. Supervisors territories constantly change. You can be in a territory 10-15 minutes from your residence then hours and your expectations don’t change. 
Progressive,Auto Claims Adjuster,4,Great place to start and learn the role. Heavy workload but not to bad once you get used to it. Decent pay for starting role compared to other insurance companies. 
Progressive,Insurance Agent,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?none  best part part, poor service for costumerWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?take too long to get an answer.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?they only care  money, not costumerWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?normal day, same problems same frustrations"
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,3,"Everyone was very nice and the training felt thorough, but after training it was clear that not all info was covered; it was a little stressful. Pay matched the job duties."
Progressive,Claims Supervisor,1,There's a lack of review of what employees go through with a high growth rate in the Illinois Auto Claims. Over 85% of the adjusters are in role less than a year and have no reliable mentor structure. Training programs are new and still being worked out. Everyone is expected to put in 10 to 12 hour days to be successful. They dangle promotions and growth opportunities to maximize performance. Most goals set are unachievable because the company is trying get back to an archaic idealized KPI that is not forward facing or account for the current environment. Almost every exit interview or survey shows that the main concern is an excessive workload. 
Progressive,Bodily Injury Claims Adjuster,5,"Progressive is a great place to work. Their training is comprehensive and there is great focus on employee development and wellbeing. Compensation is fair and the yearly gain share bonus is INCREDIBLE. I found claims to be extremely stressful and ultimately could not stomach how often I was yelled at by customers while WFH employees were not working at the capacity they should have been able to. If you’re able to let things roll off your back, this is the job for you."
Progressive,Resolution Specialist,5,This is by far the best company i have worked for. Pay is great. The benefits are good.  Work life balance is a top priority. Most work for home and they provide everything you need
Progressive,Customer Service,2,"Progressive Insurance offers a dynamic work environment with opportunities for growth. The culture promotes teamwork and innovation, making it a great place to build a career"
Progressive,Centralized Support Representative Sr (Remote),3,What is the best part of working at the company?The people are the best to work! Everyone super friendly and helpful !What is the most stressful part about working at the company?It’s a lot of information to remember and the pay is low! What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The environment is super chill and friendly!What is a typical day like for you at the company?Processing claims and answering phones
Progressive,Consultant,3,The training is great and management js amazing. You get to ask questions and get help. The co workers are truly the best and great. The calls are back to back and exhausting 
Progressive,Insurance Sales Agent,3,"The management was so supportive and helpful. They assigned you coaches and funded a course so you can study for your insurance exam. Unfortunately, everything in training was all sunshine and rainbows and they didn't do a good job of preparing you for how awful their customers are. I have never experienced anything like it and would never want to ever again. Management is very supportive, benefits are great, they help you get your insurance license, but the back to back calls with rude customers will have an impact on your mental health."
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,3,"Overworked and underpaid. Management doesn't care about anything except meeting metrics, your wellbeing is out the door once you walk in. The salary looks good until you realize you have to put in at least 70 hours a week to stay above water. Stay hourly as long as you can!"
Progressive,MRR,5,"Great place to work, feels like family.Treats everyone with respect.Always have something going on that makes you feel a part of the team.Always willing to work with you for time off or needing a different schedule"
Progressive,Claim Representative,3,Good people to work with and there is opportunity. Being a claims adjuster is the most difficult job in the world. People can be mean. You will have to work hard
Progressive,IT System Enginee Lead,1,"Never had time off and worked around the clock. Developed medical conditions from it and they dumped me. I had FMLA and they did not honor it so I left with unemployment benifits. I was punished constantly by being given nonstop workflow. The more you should you were capable, the more you had to do while coworkers play on ipads and cosign off your work. "
Progressive,Administrative Claims Specialist,4,"This position was one of the best positions I’ve had. They’re super flexible. You can choose your own schedule if permitted in your area. It’s a hybrid position. So it’s typically one day in the office and then the remainder of the month you can work from home. It’s a very freeing position, no micromanaging. If you keep up with the work load it’s an easy job. There are opportunities to move up and enjoy a pay increase. "
Progressive,Specialist ,4,"Great benefits, flexible schedules, lots of opportunities for growth within the company. Management really cares for employees and concerns are heard."
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,5,Great training and a great work environment. As long as you do your work there are many opportunities for advancement. They also have a great bonus program as well.
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,4,Got a heavy workload and had to take calls for others claims while trying to work your own. I did not feel fairly compensated for the work I was doing. I enjoyed my coworkers and management but it is a very stressful job. Definitely not for everyone.
Progressive,Senior Commercial Claims Adjuster ,5,I am only leaving because of the travel.  I would like to do this virtually I have 20 years of field experience.  I don’t have much bad to say.  Good company 
Progressive,Mailroom Associate,4,"I have only worked here a few months, but it’s been a positive experience. I love my co workers, and the supervisors are great and helpful however we do run out of work a lot of times so it can get boring. This is a great stepping stone into the company and they always have new job postings! "
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,3,"The initial training is thorough, however it is my opinion that new reps progress to receiving full claims volume too quickly. However, management and team members are very helpful."
Progressive,Administrative Assistant,2,What is the best part of working at the company?I was fired for no reason and HR doesn’t even protect you.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?My supervisor wanting me to lie about situations that are not true.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful  and uncomfortable praying that it gets better.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Doing more than expected. Never being understood by management.
Progressive,Insurance Sales Agent – PAA,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Flexible scheduling and time offWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Alot of talking to customers and looking up qualifications and guidelinesWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great fellow employees, responsive leaders and everyone willing to help each other succeedWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Learning how to access and help customers with different insurance needs"
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,3,"Everyone was very nice and the training felt thorough, but after training it was clear that not all info was covered; it was a little stressful. Pay matched the job duties."
Progressive,Adjuster,5,"Pay is fair plenty of time off. Hard to get on with the company but they do train well and offer tons of support. Lots of resources available, and looks amazing on a resume "
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,4,Haven’t been here for long however the job is challenging but there is a lot of support for you to do well. Just apply yourself and know that you’ll make mistakes. 
Progressive,Service Agent,4,Pretty good starting pay and depending on which depart you move to the calls get easier to manage. Would recommend to who really need a job and potential career
Progressive,Bilingual Customer Service Representative,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Leadership’s ability to help employees grow.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?I do not feel my position is stressful What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It is a very happy and inclusive environment What is a typical day like for you at the company?Take calls and service customers.
Progressive,Insurance Agent,3,"Calls are back to back. The colleagues are nice but the pay just isn’t enough. They do gain share at the end of the year which is based on how the company does as a whole and it was a nice amount but it doesn’t amount to what I could’ve been making for being able to get monthly commissions. I started as a CSR and got licensed but they only upped my pay by $1 so when I get called for both sales and services, the pay increase really isn’t much. I’d rather work dept for $1/hr less than the fact I took on way more work and barely get rewarded. If anything it’s become draining"
Progressive,Insurance Consultant,5,"Progressive is an amazing company to work for and I’ve been here for over 6 years. Great pay and benefits, plenty of opportunities for promotions. I would always recommend to work here to friends and family. "
Progressive,Claims Generalist Associate,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Working from home for a major company What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Training was too short. Not long enough to properly prepare me for the job. So many claims, not enough helpWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Hard to say, most people in the office were new, people who had been there for a while were all working from homeWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Continues repeat calls from clients & claimants. Diaries continuously increasing"
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,3,There is a ton of micromanagement. The pay and benefits are good but it's stressful work. Management really only seems to care about how quickly you get through your claims. 
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,3,"The claims load once you are months in become unmanageable. You become salary once you graduate onboarding and 8hrs is not enough time to complete your work. The work/life balance is horrible, but it’s your choice to work over or not. The expectations are unrealistic."
Progressive,Software Developer,5,Great place to work. Everyone is extremely helpful. Lots of technology to get into. Tons of continuing education opportunities. The sky is the limit. No room for cowboy coders. They have tried tested processes.
Progressive,Flood Underwriter II,5,Progressive is a wonderful company to work for. They have the highest of standards and ethics and will back their employees up 100%. I've worked from home since COVID and receive all of the support needed to do my job. My managers are caring and always helpful. The hardest part of my job currently is not having the personal interaction now that we work from home. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers receive the best possible rate for their NFIP policies.
Progressive,Multi-Product Agent,1,"No leadership engagement. Don’t expect to have positive, negative, or any feedback. Terrible at work life balance. Haven’t had a legitimate coaching to gauge my performance in months. No flexible scheduling. "
Progressive,Agent,1,Worst company I've ever worked for. You will be mirror managed by people who don't actually know how to do their job. Chances are you might have to explain insurance protocols and laws to your supervisor. 
Progressive,Claims Support Specialist,5,Always felt very appreciatedWork from Home Flexibility Company Sponsored Events Plenty of Opportunities to Develop Your Career Internally Good Benefits 
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,2,"Poor mid managers and favoritism run rampant.  It was all about sucking up to supervisors and managers in order to get help with projects.  Lots of micromanaging.  That places will drive you ill, literally."
Progressive,Consultant,5,Overall a great company to work for. Really enjoy the environment & the great benefits. Everyone is pleasant to work with and the pay is great. It is hard to get into. Interview process is long.
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,1,"Super high call volume. Not enough time to get a sip of water in between calls. Recruiters will say that you don’t have to upsell, but when you’re on the floor, they push PHA numbers."
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,3,"Job was okay, a lot of work put on 1 adjuster. Hard for adjusters to manager everything including total losses. Management doesn’t seem to understand that and puts anybody in leadership positions. Also be ready to switch teams randomly. Can sometimes be hard to actually get good at what you’re doin because they’re so short staffed they put you everywhere under the disguise that you’re being developed however they’re just overworking you, stay woke "
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,3,"While I was at Progressive, it was very fast paced, I learned alot but never felt valued. It felt like a claims mill and I was just expected to work all claims at all times. "
Progressive,Sales Consultant,3,Love being able to work from home that’s always a plus and they are always pushing for career growth. Working in sales there’s not really any incentive to sale besides the company wide bonus at the end of the year and you will take constant non-stop calls no down time
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,3,"Everyone was very nice and the training felt thorough, but after training it was clear that not all info was covered; it was a little stressful. Pay matched the job duties."
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,5,The company has its ups and downs like all companies but the work life balance was fine. The co-workers and managers were great as well. Great place to get claims experience.
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,3,Answer phones literally back to back- almost all negative calls customers wear down mental health and there aren’t alternatives. Not even time to cry between calls. Not for me. 
Progressive,Sales Insurance Agent,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Diversity, Inclusion and Flexibility What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Sometimes handling difficult customers What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Amazing, transparent and inclusive"
Progressive,Claims Representative,4,"great benefits, awesome pto offerings. training was good and accurate. slow days but a lot of calls back to back. loved working with the company and would recommend "
Progressive,Consultant,5,Progressive is a great company to work. Interview process was simple. Benefits were great and you get them on day one. Great communication only down fall is the calls are back to back 
Progressive,Licensed Insurance Agent,4,Work is on in insurance sales besides the occasional angry person.  The shifts can seem very long at times and the money is good to start but definitely can be better.
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,3,Great place to work. Management was great. Training was 8 weeks and very informative. Pay was great. I would recommend working here to everyone. Benefits are good too. 
Progressive,Customer Service Representative,5,"Great place to work, I love the flexibility of my schedule and being able to work from home. Management is great as well, I would recommend working at Progressive to everyone. Feels like my time working here has flown by. "
Progressive,Consultant,3,Overall great benefits and management was laid back but the workload is very overwhelming on top of the pressures to up sell customers to buy other insurance products with us. If you’re into sales then you’ll like it. 
Progressive,Supervisor,5,"I have been with Progressive for 8 years now and I still love it! The benefits are good.  They seem to actually care about the employees. I am a huge fan of Trisha, the CEO."
Progressive,Endorsement Specialist,1,The management are terrible. Your supervisor will tell you how great you are doing then the next you will be written up for not producing good enough. I blame this company for my severe anxiety an depression while employed. 
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,5,It is a great place to work and has wonderful support systems and resources! Everyone is so helpful and management really cares about your development and helping you grow within the company. They promote strictly from within and they have so many options for departments to work in that the possibilities to work in an area that suits each individual's needs is endless. The only downside is I wish I had started working at Progressive sooner in my career.  Even if you have no experience whatsoever in Insurance you will be able to be trained and be a pro. They're training is so wonderful and inclusive that you learn without even realizing how much you've learned. 10 out of 10 recommend!!
Progressive,Managed Repair Representative,4,"Progressive has a great culture. Benefits and PTO are fantastic. In my experience, only about 1/3 of the adjusters in my region actually cared enough to put in effort while the rest did the minimum. This left us always behind with upset customers.  Usually,  the best performing employees had to clean up the mess and smooth things over with upset customers.Also, if you do work hard, you're asked to take on more with no reward.  Overall, Progressive is a great company to work for, but it could be even better if some employees were held more accountable. "
Progressive,Claims support specialist,4,"Always learned something new. My coworkers were the best people I ever worked with. The job itself was easy to do but the politics there wasn’t. Never truly felt like I received support from my leader, and I know I wasn’t the only one, which is unfortunate since I heard other colleagues in other departments talk and brag how amazing theirs was."
Progressive,Consultant Services,4,I enjoyed my time at Progressive . Seems that they put a lot of effort into training . Pay was decent and promotional opportunities were better than any company I have been with . 
Progressive,Claims Adjuster,5,The culture and diversity at Progressive is phenomenal. 90% of positions are remote. Gainshare bonus at the end of the year $$. There's also ample opportunities for growth and promotions.
Progressive,Service Consultant,5,"Plenty of  room for growth, good bonuses, good hourly pay, good compensation, plenty of overtime, they have empathy for there workers, you can bid on new shifts"
Progressive,Tampa,4,Great company to work for with great benefits. My Job was not stressful. I didn’t leave work taking work home with me from being stressed out daily.  
Progressive,Licensed Sales Producer,3,The company provides a great work-life balance and the bonuses are a plus. They provide equipment and the lunch room is spectacular. the training was amazing with help from great staff when needed. 
Progressive,Customer Relations Specialist,3,"Expectations can be a  bit unreasonable at times, Management can be supportive or discouraging it depends who you have. I experienced a bit of both during my years at Progressive. Definitely a diverse company, with a great company culture. It is pretty hard to excel into other positions. So many metrics to meet. You can be the best at your job, but they nit pick at the small things vs the larger picture. Great company to learn insurance with as they will train you and the starting wage is decent. Don't recommend for long term, as the raises are disappointing & the time between calls was non existent towards the end of my career with Progressive."
Enterprise Products,Measurement Technician,4,Working for Enterprise Products was a great experience. Learned a ton and worked with great people. Laid back atmosphere as long as work is completed  timely. 
Enterprise Products,Measurement Technician,4,Great place to work. Work is consistent and everyone mainly gets along with each other. Decent pay and good benefits. Laid back environment. Good people.
Enterprise Products,Operator,5,"You have to be part of the ""click"" to get promotions and move up within the company. If you go against anyone in management, (just a simple disagreement) they'll look for ways to fire you. They have close friends in HR. "
Enterprise Products,Corrosion Technician,4,Challenging environment due to workload and constant changes. The right supervisor makes all the difference. Work is often not always communicated upfront between different work groups.
Enterprise Products,Maintenance Technician,4,Decent place to workThey care about  employees and are very big on safety .plenty of opportunities within the company but Lots of people come and go .
Enterprise Products,Accountant,3,"It's a very old school company. Management looks out for themselves and that ultimately leaves you alone, untrained, and overwhelmed. It seems like it's moreso the tone at the top."
Enterprise Products,I&E Technician,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great place to work lots of room to move up or transfer, multiple locations and lots of training classes available.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lots of procedures to learn how they do things but it's all for the better of the company.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Everyone is laid back Everyone helps each other, management is pretty good just follow the rules and procedures.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Every Monday morning we have a meeting to discuss what's on the schedule for the week. You what you'll be doing the week besides for any emergencies they're pretty organized."
Enterprise Products,Crude Oil Driver,3,"I like the other drivers. Great bunch of men and women. Follow their rules and they basically leave you alone. Picking up same leases can get monotonous. Other yards (e.g. Midland, Pecos) get a bigger percentage of load revenue and they should equalize this and your hourly portion of pay needs to be higher. Nice and new tractors, Peterbilt 567’s with flat top sleepers. They need to get some new crude trailers. They frequently get all your 14 hour clock if you get all loads you are dispatched. "
Enterprise Products,Accounts Receivable Analyst,3,"I enjoyed working at EPCO, until a huge merger happened and all the politics rolled in. The company is always merging and acquiring new subsidiaries. The last one I experienced came in and brought their own people and started handing out new rules and the entire morale collapsed almost overnight. It went from being a wonderful place to work to a living nightmare. That was back in 2008, so I am sure much has changed. I wish them well."
Enterprise Products,Gathering Technician,4,"I have been working for Enterprise for 5 months now and I have zero complaints so far. What I enjoy about the culture here is that every employee is held accountable for their actions. I believe this company is a good fit for me because of its values and the work to life ratio which are both equally important to me. If you're looking for an employer who cares about your safety and will train you on every aspect of your job, this is it. I have to mention that promotions come easy to those who are willing to put themselves out there to learn. "
Enterprise Products,Administrative Assistant,5,The hardest part of my job was having to leave because I didn’t want to put him in daycare. The easiest part was the amount of work and list you accomplished and before you knew it was time to go home. The people were so helpful and respectful I enjoyed working here. I was promoted to Admin assistant at the Baytown office and hired full time great salary and wonderful benefits especially for labor and delivery. 
Enterprise Products,Accountant,3,"The work life balance here was really good but unfortunately no flexibility to work from home, so there was a lot of sitting around in the office trying to find things to do. "
Enterprise Products,Manager ,2,What is the best part of working at the company?The training offered has really improved. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Pay is not great and not all are compensated fairly. Salaried employees do not receive benefits that hourly employees do. First line supervisors carry a huge workload. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic mostly. If you are not a yes man you will not go very far. Micromanaging by inexperienced management if the worst. What is a typical day like for you at the company?14 hr work days are the norm. On call 24/7 with no compensation. Constant zoom calls that provide little benefit to the work at hand.
Enterprise Products,Crude Oil Transport Driver,2,"I haul crude oil, which is great, but if there's a manager or a supervisor involved in whatever's happening , it's gonna get bad quickly.I'm a tool the company uses to get oil in the pipeline.  If there's work available do it, and hey you might get paid correctly.  But I don't never get acknowledged as a person.The hardest part of my job is how sloppy management is about everything.  Bad communication.Lies all the timeThey don't care if I succeed or not."
Enterprise Products,Driver,5,"Steady check, if your looking for stability great health insurance and this is the place for you.Great place to get your feet wet in the gas and oil industry."
Enterprise Products,IT Analyst,1,It’s toxic. Completely toxic. Women have their own dept where they can work but in IT it’s a dead end. It’s a boys club and I have heard senior management say daily and often. It’s not a good place u less you’re cutthroat or related to someone. 
Enterprise Products,Gathering Technician,4,"Best 10 years of my adult career. Management sometimes hard to deal with. Coworkers were some of the best people and friends I’ve met. If you can get on with this company, it is definitely worth it. "
Enterprise Products,ECall Analyst,5,"If you get a job here, you can create a long-lasting career, but you have to work hard and ask questions. Nothing is given for free; you have to network and reach out. The worst they can say is no, the best is you get an even better paying job. Do not stay quiet in your cubicle, if you do, you'll never get anywhere. The people here are very kind, you just have to talk to them. "
Enterprise Products,Truck Mechanic,4,This place is not for everybody you have to have a high work ethic work does not stop & it is always busy. Management & operations are very good to you & always feed the employees when goals are met. Management is leniant & does not get involved issues are kept in house.
Enterprise Products,Senior Manager,2,"Work is fast paced and busy, which I like, but it is a thankless place to work. Upper management rules by fear, you are in constant fear for your job."
Enterprise Products,Senior Accountant,4,Overall decent accounting function. The company as a whole provides no flexibility to work from home when needed. Under average pay compared to competitors. 
Enterprise Products,Measurement Technician,4,Working for Enterprise Products was a great experience. Learned a ton and worked with great people. Laid back atmosphere as long as work is completed  timely.

Enterprise Products,Crude Oil Driver,2,Typical day is 14 hours a day no time for home.  What’s the point of going home and only spending time to eat and right to sleep. Trainer was really bad money hungry seems like they are all old guys in there mid 50s don’t have nothing else to do but work 
Enterprise Products,Laboratory Technician,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Pay, benefits and the amount of vacation (pto)What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Shiftwork……constantly going back and forth between days and nights. Working nonstop for 12 hours straight is very taxing and your body and mind.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very poor stressful hectic environment. I wouldn’t recommend this type of work if you’re married because the majority of people out there at Enterprise are divorced or are going to get to that point working all the time.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy beyond comprehension and very hectic!"
Enterprise Products,Intern,2,"Cutthroat type of environment with lots of turnover.  There was room to grow, but management was controlling.  Great pay and benefits was really the only good thing here.  Felt as if they cared more about growth and less about me. "
Enterprise Products,Truckdriver ,4,Decent company good home time worst part of job being away from family. Other then that a decent company just like all companies have there ups n downs
Enterprise Products,Administrative Assistant,5,"Great company and great benefits. There are a lot of oil and gas companies but this one is one of the best. From management down to contract workers, they care for safety and their employees. "
Enterprise Products,Analyst,3,"Good place to learn and start your career. They do offer great benefits and you will certainly learn a lot. The work load can be high depending on your role and your group. Management varies and there isn’t much consistency. Some managers are very laid back and others are extremely up tight. There is no flexible schedule and despite the constant complaint and high turnover, the company will not change this. "
Enterprise Products,Operations Supervisor,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Great benefits and good bonus program. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working under a micromanager who feels he needs all the credit. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very who you know. Only those that are on the right click climb. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work hard for your money and work for others that don’t.
Enterprise Products,Driver,3,"Poor management, you have no say so. If top dawgs are at the safety meeting, best believe the management will be so nice to you, otherwise they are all against you. They are always nitpicking on anything. Pleasanton tx yard has a high turnover rate. Ask around, those who know will never come work for this yard. One last thing, they have their favorites, good luck if you do apply."
Enterprise Products,Senior Project Manager,5,"Good people doing quality work with lots of logic, reasoning, and experience navigating the workforce of commanding stars that exert tons of energy with knowledge. "
Enterprise Products,HR Assistant,1,"Nepotism is rampant. No innovation, company operates like a mom and pop business. There is plenty of room to improve. Manual processes across the board. Inefficient processes. "

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working the DCS boards and plant goes down.

It’s not always comfortable when you aren’t a part of the “in” group.  What is a typical day like for you at the company?For Operations it’s making rounds, completing lockout/tag outs, filling out paperwork and writing permits.  During night shifts there can be quite a bit of downtime.  I would usually spend this time studying P&ID’s and operating manuals."
Enterprise Products,Administration Assistant,3,The women do more work than the men and get no raises. Pat on the back at most. No guidance or goals set and although you go above and beyond you will not be recognized unfortunately.
Enterprise Products,Allied Universal Security Officer,5,The company isn’t that bad it could be better. Doesn’t pay much if you need a job and enjoy working in the rain heat and cold being underpaid then this job is for you 
Enterprise Products,Measurement Technician,4,Working for Enterprise Products was a great experience. Learned a ton and worked with great people. Laid back atmosphere as long as work is completed  timely.

Enterprise Products,Driver,3,Benefits are on point. Dispatch team keep you chasing your tail a lot. If you are an Enterprise first type of person you will do great. Good place to get experience.
Enterprise Products,Supervisor,5,"I was a contractor for over 10 years and never had an issue that could not be worked through satisfactorily for everyone. Being direct now with the company has just made my great experience as a contractor, even better. I really enjoy how so many want to help everyone out (including myself). The training available to us now, helps to make us a better informed employee. I also feel the company is making changes to make things better where there are some issues. I have nothing to comment on in those areas since they are not in my area. "
Enterprise Products,Process Operator,2,Management are nothing but some engineers who doesn't have people skills and they treat you like robots. And everybody is disgruntled and brainwashed.
Enterprise Products,Operations ,5,Great pay and lots of ot. Lots of hazards but no major incidents. Safety is number 1 in a hazardous workplace with enterprise.  They have never laid off in the 25 years ive been here that i know of.
Enterprise Products,Pipeline Operator,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The company overall seems to be a good company to work for.

The regional operations manager, and the regional HR rep are deplorable, despicable, worthless individuals.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Local management is absolutely horribleWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?A few good people, but local management destroys everything and it touches. Backstabbing, dishonest individuals.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Anytime you can avoid management, your day is pretty good"
Enterprise Products,Pipeline Operator,3,"The company could exceed more if they give incentives that help give a sense of ownership. Bonuses, smart goals pay for performance program would work wonders."
Enterprise Products,Technician,2,"You can make some great money here, its not one comp ay, enterprise was built on buying other companies and all the systems have there own little company. Some happy some not some paid better some not. Good job overall, bad part is once you make a certain amount you don't get any increase regardless of how much you do or experience you gain."
Enterprise Products,Commercial Director,2,"The company runs very lean which is great for job security, but there is no flexibility in schedules. There is a corporate “no work from home” policy for any reason. "
Enterprise Products,Administration,4,"Depending on who you rub elbows with, you can get ahead. Some departments management could benefit from some diversity training. Overall a nice company to work for with a 4 and 1/2 day work week."
Enterprise Products,Gas Pipeline Controller,5,"Had it not been for one very bad manager, I would still be working there today. Great company. “The company” does a fantastic job of taking care of its employees. I’d recommend to anyone to give this company a chance."
Enterprise Products,Technician,2,"ZERO work-life balance.  Expect to answer your phone and have to leave at any minute.  No compensation for on-call responsibilities, which is 24/7/365, unless you use PTO (which can be adjusted and denied by management)."
Enterprise Products,Sr Project Manager/Sr Scrum Master (Agile Coach for Company),5,Good company to work for.  Management support.  Pay is great.  Worklife balance.   Growth is good.  Fail fast recovery fast.  Do not repeat mistakes.  Be transparent.   Communicate at all levels in company.   
Enterprise Products,Technician,4,The company is good and the pay is good but the job is uninspiring. Slightly over staffed. Either bored or busy. Once you get in and don't break any major rules you are probably here for a long time.
Enterprise Products,Operations,4,"Those who work in this department know the gig for the most part and that there are limited options for promotion, but the pay is so good, most don't care. The schedule is arduous, but the time off is also good. Company is most often recognized as the industry standard."
Enterprise Products,"Houston, TX",3,Overall it’s a good ole boys type of company but leads in the midstream oil and gas field. No work life balance or flexibility at all and doesn’t consider hybrid type of work.
Enterprise Products,Pipeline Operator,4,"Review orders and line up pipelines to load ships and barges. I learned how petroleum products are pumped and transferred to vessels and tanks. Management somewhat stand-offish. They don't micro-manage the employees  as long as orders are being completed in an orderly fashion. The most complex part of the job is learning how to facilitate the movement of product from inside the control room. You have to know a lot of procedures to ensure safe transfer of products. The most enjoyable part of the job is having multiple off days, working with a group of people with common interests, and operating particular machinery such as cranes and flares."
Enterprise Products,Measurement Technician,4,Working for Enterprise Products was a great experience. Learned a ton and worked with great people. Laid back atmosphere as long as work is completed  timely. 
Enterprise Products,Financial Analyst,3,"Great and strong company that will probably never go under, but employees are overworked and underpaid compared to their competitors. I easily went to a competitor for 20% more in comp and 20% less work."
Enterprise Products,Process Operator,4,"Pretty good place to work at , most people are willing to help you out. Supervisors are knowledgeable of the units. Your on call one week out of the year. ( on longchange)"
Enterprise Products,Truck Driver Class A,3,Lack of raises it’s been 8 years since I had one great benefits five days on and 2 days off then five days on and three days off quarterly bonuses of $1000 
Enterprise Products,Inland tankerman,4,The schedule is grueling. You're absolutely fairly compensated for your time but being away from home for so long stresses all relationships. The advancement procedures and policies are fair and plentiful. Lateral hiring is encouraged and done often. Overall my time with Enterprise was good. Would recommend mostly to those without or not yet having a family. 
Enterprise Products,Pipeline Technician,5,Great company to work for.  Work life balance is great unless you have a large project going on in you area but when it comes to end you miss the project after a couple months.   Paid time off.  
Enterprise Products,Scheduler,3,"Come in, work hard, and get your feet wet.If you are good and/or well connected, you will go up the corporate ladder.If it does not work out, other companies will reward your hard work and experience."
Enterprise Products,Technician,1,"Everything this company is about is for the elite at the top. Technicians are treated poorly with no incentives to want to work any harder  (no bonus, raises are a joke, and they expect you to be able to perform all job roles even if people don’t know a dang thing about it). "
Enterprise Products,Crude Oil Driver,5,"Best job I have ever had, decent pay and vacation time. Full benefits from day 1, 6% 401K match 4% Profit sharing. Great management. 2 weeks vacation a year"
Enterprise Products,Project Manager,4,"Culture has been changing over the years.  There appears to be a lot of hiring for political reasons, and results are overlooked if you a part of the ""club"""
Enterprise Products,Crude Oil Driver,5,Overall a good place to work. I have enjoyed my time here a great deal. Pros: great benefits and decent payCons: work/home life balance could be better 
Enterprise Products,Crude Oil Hauler,1,Cameras in trucks forward and in cab view. Management and safety is constantly berating and threatening drivers with disciplinary action.  Area manager does everything possible to reduce the yards proficiency to make it appear  the drivers do not want to work.  Very toxic and stressful work environment 
Enterprise Products,Supervisor,4,You have to hold out for the long term if you are looking to advance and make serious money. They work you hard and take advantage of you being on salary. Lots of long hard days with nothing to show for it.
Enterprise Products,Pipeline Operator,5,Great people and good pay. Time off and vacation time were really good. They even offer an advance check if you need it starting off as an employee. Nothing bad to say at all. 
Enterprise Products,"Sr. Director, Operations",5,Enterprise has been a great place to spend the majority of my entire career. I currently have 19 years with the company and could not see myself anywhere else. It is a great culture with outstanding benefits. It is a large company that is run like a big family business. Senior level leadership always takes interest in the employees and their families well being. 
Enterprise Products,Pipeline Technician,5,Enterprise Products offers any training you need for any job that you may encounter in the field. Average around 1000hrs overtime a year. When projects are going on you will be working alot of hours but it balances out when your working the normal day to day operations.
Enterprise Products,Process Operator,2,"It's a buddy buddy system. They love kiss ups and hate people who think for themselves, or people who voice their opinions even in a professional manner. It is very much that you have to go along to get along."
Enterprise Products,Accountant,4,Best benefits I've had outside of the military and the pay is good. Only downside is there is no formal coaching/review process and you better be in the good old boys' club to really succeed.
Enterprise Products,Quality Assurance Coordinator,3,"I was in the same position for 5 years, no room for advancement unless you change departments. Very caddy women who watch your every move and tattle for everything. You only get good pay if you are sleeping with upper management."
Enterprise Products,Lead Document Control Specialist,2,"No support from Human resources or management for issues that arise.  The culture wasn't very friendly. There is no job descriptions, no annual employee reviews and very little training."
Enterprise Products,Process Operator,1,"Management doesn’t care about you or your shift mates, what ever makes them get their bonuses is really all they care about, it’s hard to work for a organization led and managed my “YES” men. When the first question after a shutdown or upset is when is it coming back up, not what caused the issue it really tells you all you need to hear. "
Enterprise Products,Measurement Technician,4,Working for Enterprise Products was a great experience. Learned a ton and worked with great people. Laid back atmosphere as long as work is completed  timely. 
Enterprise Products,Scheduler,4,Great company to work for. Denver office has the small business feel but working for a large corporation. Some managers are willing to teach and are patient with you if you communicate clearly. 
Enterprise Products,Senior Real-Time Simulations Engineer,5,Enterprise is a great company! Their management is all knowledgeable in the business and treat their employees fairly. The only downside was people kept ruining i worked for enterprise rent a car haha! 
Enterprise Products,Pipeline Controller,5,Overall a great place to work. Compensation is above average and work atmosphere is positive. Discounted stock options are an added perk. Some corporate discounts also available.
Enterprise Products,Pipeline Technician,4,Not micromanaged and pretty much set my own schedule. Competitive salary and great benefits. Co-workers and my boss are easy to get along with and good job security.
Enterprise Products,Pipeline Operator,4,"worked with great crew, great management and plenty of days off, the pay was great for what my job duties were, great job security and plenty of overtime if you want it"
Enterprise Products,Pipeline Technician,4,I am very good at what I do but im in a dead end spot so supervisor won't let me leave to learn something new. My group doesn't like to cross train but other groups are not like this. 
Enterprise Products,Software Engineer,5,One of the best companies to work for. Enterprise cares about it employees and work life balance is good. Central location in downtown Houston is convenient.
Enterprise Products,Pipeline Technician,3,"At first, the company was the best company I have worked for however, it seemed to be unrealistic with some of the management. Very poor management in the group I was in."
Enterprise Products,Scapegoat,1,"I would not recommend enterprise products to my worst enemy...Management is horrible, they set you up for failure, this is a fear driven company of always threatening employees of terminationAgain, I would not recommend this company to anyone...unless they are a glutton punishment for hate, discontent and disappointment."
Enterprise Products,Data Analyst,4,Nice people and healthy environment work in. The location is also the best where you have access to almost everything in  the downtown and the place is really easy to access.
Enterprise Products,"Lead Accountant, Gas Processing Accounting",4,People you work with are nice. Great pay and benefits. We weren't treated nicely during covid but I am able to forgive as we still received raise and bonuses even after covid. Also no one was laid off to my knowledge.
Enterprise Products,Terminal Operator,4,"I really enjoyed my time at Enterprise, as a company their great but the mont belvieu division needs a better HR. Other than that great company to work for."
Enterprise Products,Measurement Automation technician,4,"The position can be fun if you like something different each week. Sometimes Working with local operations to support their measurement infrastructure. Sometimes working on new installations of various types of measurement skids, gas, liquids, products, crude. You may be called to Houston area, West Texas, other places for a week or so to oversee construction and program RTUs. There is a lot of independent work required and decision making required. Company truck is provided as well as tools needed. Also making trips to skid fabricators to perform factory acceptance tests before the equipment leaves the facility. Most of this activity has just a few days notice so much flexibility is required. Training on equipment and devices consist of ""here's a PowerPoint, figure it out"". So no formal training but knowing who to call helps and you can get help from people over the phone. They expect you to act as an engineer but pay you as a standard technician that has a regular schedule. "
Enterprise Products,Plant Operator,4,"Good company, love the schedule and pay and benefits are on the high end for the industry. Close group of guys in operations and maintenance. Good supervisor. "
Enterprise Products,Process Operator,2,"thats really all I have to say about it. If you're an employee of enterprise, watch out for toxic management. The will try to take your job away from you."
Enterprise Products,I&E Technician,5,Great company to work for. They care and take care of their own. It’s a true brotherhood organization. Always learning something new everyday and never afraid to ask for help because everyone is there ready to help and teach.
Enterprise Products,Unspecified ,3,"Good pay, decent benefits. Old school upper management - demand and control, instead of motivate and empower to get results. Good equipment and challenging, fast paced environment. Having worked for other companies in this industry, the good and bad net out to the same as the others. It is what you make of it. Not the family, cohesive team management believes it is, but it least it’s what they say they want. "
Enterprise Products,Operations ,5,Great pay and benefits.. love the work schedule 7 and 7. Company seems to make money with everything they do so they have good job security. Fast paced but fun.
Enterprise Products,Terminal Operator and Process Operator,4,"As an operator at EPCO, you are paid well and get good benefits. If your unit is staffed up well and you are not on a turn around, you get plenty of days off. Shift work can be hard to adjust to for some and missing weekends and holidays can suck."
Enterprise Products,Driver,5,"Enterprise is a midstream energy giant,with pipelines, processing plants, trucking, and a marine division. The benefits and pay are awesome and advancement opportunities are there."
Nationwide,Underwriter,3,"Depends on what department you are in, every department operates different. Accomodations for scheduling is non existent. Management never knows exactly what is going on"
Nationwide,"Specialist, software Engineer",2,Managers and team mates were great - until they all got fired.  I made the mistake of blindly taking on the work nobody else wanted to do and now I am stuck.  I made it as far as I can as a specialist - but I'll never be able to make it into 'The Club' as I am not a type-a personality.
Nationwide,Clerk,5,It was great love it. What an amazing company to work for it was an honor to work for nationwide court service. I meet many great people have many great memories learnt alot.
Nationwide,Customer Service Consultant,2,"A lot of internal issues that do not get resolved. The role itself is manageable but when you combine the internal issues.

Especially with its low pay. "
Nationwide,"ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT, Corporate Communications",5,"Nationwide has been a great place to work.

NIKE,Retail Associate,4,The only downsides to working at nike as a retail associate is that it is super boring and they love to schedule you as much as possible. You pretty much get paid for standing there so it's' not too bad for a part time job 
NIKE,Sales Associate,5,Fun environment employees are like family I love working here because you get to meet new people everyday all while helping them leave happy with items they came to buy 
NIKE,Stock Associate,4,"Flexible schedule, good benefits, can move up if willing to put the work in. Pay was ok but they offered a lot to make up for it. Long lunch breaks as well "
NIKE,Material Handler/Trainer,5,"I came to Memphis and never ever worked in a warehouse. I was hired as a material handler and was clueless what to expect. I was trained and I was terrible at first but when I learned it, I LEARNED IT. I Being crossed trained in all departments was a plus. had the highest production most weeks and the account manager asked me to be a  new hire trainer in the classroom. Working in the classroom was the BEST job and greatest experience ever. The managers were so friendly and helpful at all times. Made a lot of friends and that still keep in touch with today. The hardest part was leaving  but I  now have great skills that has opened many doors for me in management positions because of my work experience at NIKE. "
NIKE,Sales Associate,4,Great for college student needing flexible hours. It does slow up during the winter and early parts of the year…but great for someone on break from school
NIKE,Retail Sales Associate,4,"Nike promotes a culture of respect and kindness and it shows at a store level. The team embodies these values. Taking the term 'promote' more literally, Nike promotes from within and makes a concerted effort to develop all employees, so there's lots of opportunity to rise up the 'food chain'. Nike has a diverse customer base so it is a great way to immerse yourself with all walks of life. The pay could be better for a standard employee though, it is not nearly enough to afford a place of your own, and even with a roommate you will still struggle. The employee discounts are very good: 30% in store- on special occasions it becomes 50%- and %40 online (except from the 50% these discounts are extended to your family as well). Another grievance: store level management made it a priority to make a genuine connection with every employee, however when corporate would visit they would barely bat an eye or much less speak to anyone other than the managers. Of course, they're busy but, especially as an employee who felt they made an impact on sales and brought the team together, it would have been nice to get any sort of acknowlegement for the effort put in."
NIKE,"Phoenix, AZ",5,Amazing place to work. The team were fun and this was a great first job. It is exactly what you would expect from a retail job. I would recommend for first time job.
NIKE,Sales Associate,2,"It's okay?  The people that work here show favoritism like crazy  it's actually sickening. The management you gotta be a kiss up  and don't be a know it all. The discount is elite for sure, but man the standing for hours talking to people and then you get limited breaks. It's what you expect in retail you gotta be constantly moving talking folding preparing. It gets heavy on weekends too. Overall the job is cool for someTime but it's get burnt out after a while & it's takes forever to even get hired on. They use temporary people and kick them to the curb so don't bother applying for temp unless you really wanna be used or if you only need the money for a short time. "

NIKE,Athlete,4,"The job itself wasn't too bad at all, I personally enjoyed it. Talking to different customers about one of the top brands in the world was fun, and the product basically sells itself. The pay increased while working there, but it's nothing to brag about at all. Overall, a good experience."
NIKE,Sales Associate,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Management people are the bestWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The store can be extremely busy at times
NIKE,Waitress,5,Great people to be around 100 percent believe that they can do anything to make you feel good and they are the best in your heart to do it and you will 
NIKE,Retail Sales Associate,2,Great presentation overall through the interview process. Bad management and communication. workplace very destructive and toxic. The hardest part was to talk to management 1 on 1 when I would struggle with coworkers and customers . Personal interest in employees was non existent overall terrible experience.
NIKE,Merchant ii,4,That just about sums it up. Pay is solid and the campus feels like you're back at college. The management and workers are good at what they do. The culture can be bad at times but generally good. 
NIKE,Sales Associate/Visual Merchandiser,3,"If you have kind and appreciative head staff- it's a great starter job if you align with the company. But if you have staff that purely focus on meeting metrics and nothing about Work-Life Balance, it'll become a stressful weight."
NIKE,Retail,5,Great altogether I had a wonderful experience and I would recommend working there for a great experience altogether. The staff was great and the work was fair and just.
NIKE,Sales Associate,5,A lot of sales and good partners. We received good compensations if we pass those objectives. Sometimes we receive incredible sneakers and I have chance to buy those
NIKE,Professional Scorer,5,"Working at Nike is energizing and rewarding. Supportive team, solid training, and a vibrant culture make it a great place for sports enthusiasts. While the pay is competitive, benefits for part-time employees could be better. Overall, I feel proud to work for a company that values innovation, inclusivity, and community engagement. Nike is a great place for anyone passionate about sports and looking for growth."
NIKE,Sales Associate,4,"Pay was decent, benefits are more competitive than most retail jobs. Nothing too awful other than being a typical retail job. Easy to move up within the company. "
NIKE,Lead ,5,"Loved it here! Wonderful team. Had to relocate unfortunately due to family circumstances, otherwise I would still be there!Management listened to employee concerns and provided constructive feedback with consistent goal settings and acknowledgement of a job well done."
NIKE,Vendeur,5,"An emerging company with high value, a magnificent experience that I recommend to a lot of people, whether on humans or wages"
NIKE,Retail Associate,4,The only downsides to working at nike as a retail associate is that it is super boring and they love to schedule you as much as possible. You pretty much get paid for standing there so it's' not too bad for a part time job

NIKE,Orderpicker,1,"My worst work experience was at Nike.You are a number there and everything revolves around targets.As a company you have to achieve objectives, but here it was exaggerated!You are seen here as a number and not as a person.You are a robot that has to achieve the same results every day because otherwise you will fly outside quickly !!"
NIKE,Sales Associate,3,A lot of the times it was a very gossipy environment. Management wasn’t great at listening to employees and people often got scheduled outside of their availability  
NIKE,Sales Associate,5,"Working as a sales associate at Nike offers a dynamic and energetic environment, perfect for those passionate about sports and athletic wear. The company provides thorough training, emphasizing product knowledge, customer service, and brand values. Day-to-day responsibilities involve assisting customers, maintaining merchandise displays, and ensuring the sales floor is organized. One of the highlights is the strong team-oriented culture. Co-workers are often enthusiastic and motivated, creating a positive atmosphere. Nike also encourages professional development, offering opportunities for growth within the company. However, the fast-paced environment can be challenging, especially during peak seasons. Associates are expected to multitask efficiently, from handling high customer traffic to restocking inventory quickly. Some may find the physical demands,"
NIKE,Sales Associate,5,Good place to work at. People are friendly and welcoming. Job itself is meh but you have a great team and people that support you when you need it here.

NIKE,Sales Assistant,3,#NAME?
NIKE,Materials Developer,4,Generally a good place to work. Your experience will highly depend on what team you are reporting to. Can feel like a bunh of startups that don't talk to one another. 
NIKE,Veterinary Assistant,4,"Have the articles on the shelves, check the labeling of prices, ensure the supply of shelves, welcome and advise customers, provide the requested information, demonstrate items if necessary, collect payments,"
NIKE,Director,2,"Zero accountability and outdated, bloated management. So many missed opportunities to tap into talent before it walks out the door to the competition."

NIKE,Warehouse Product Replenisher,1,"Not a good job to work for. Management is unprofessional,  lots of drama , gossiping, harassment, and conflict of interest. They want you to train and learn managerial roles that you will never get."
NIKE,Sales Associate lead,2,"I learned a lot of customer service experience, cashier, stocking, checking stock for customers etc. When I first started with this company it was great. I got employee of the month. The management was amazing. Until our best manager left and everything changed for the worst."

NIKE,Manager Assistant,3,"Not too bad if you are a fan of the company. Moving up is limited.Personally my team is aweosme. Its a scary time which contributed to mh lowet than average ratingWorking for Nike is hit or miss. The benefits are amazing, pay is okay, but leaders up and down the organization really need to get it together. One day they spout x values and the next they are going against what they were just preaching."
NIKE,Manager,5,goo d plaace to work and the product is amazing discounts are good. pay is fair . Thir is not room for advancement. all the location have great cultur

NIKE,Vendeur,5,"It was square, nothing to say.Top team, not too far from my home in addition frankly it was niquel, in addition we have promotions so we can buy clothes for daons."
NIKE,Manager,3,"I was SO proud and excited to advance my career at the prestigious beast that is Nike. I had excitement pumping through my veins in those first couple days or weeks. But it wasn’t long before I realized that my hard work was not getting the traction it should. Let me be clear that I do not mean recognition, I mean traction, because I was hired for a very specific purpose, with a very specific problem to solve for a department of about 350 employees. And after tons of research, interviews, data collection, and a deep devotion to the solutions available, I presented my findings and suggestion(s) to my Director and my Sr Director. They agreed it was solid work, which must be presented to senior management asap. So I presented to VPs, and was told “nice work. This is what we need!” And then I spent the next 6 months presenting this work to different audiences and, mind you, within my “solution(s)” was a very meticulously estimated need for budget to kick off implementation. But I just kept going in circles, being told good work, continuing to play therapist for all the employees that were suffering the pain points, and I eventually realized, there was never going to be a solution implemented— I was just there so they could tell everyone complaining, “oh we’re hiring someone to handle that.” And so I left. And I went somewhere where my work is impactful and has meaning. "
NIKE,coustomer service,5,"Awesome co-workers and great benefits , best job I ever had, if your looking for a job where you enjoy talking to people and just helping people out this is the job for you. "
NIKE,Sales Associate,5,"Nice discount for staff and it’s a cool store to work in as it’s always changing. Heart of London so it’s always busy, making time go quicker. Team is good."
NIKE,Sales Associate,4,Coworkers here were amazing and was pretty much the only reason it was bearable. Get really busy and the compensation is below average for a job that requires you to constantly be on the move and attend to multiple people a minute
NIKE,Sales Associate,4,good environment nice pplcoworkers friendlyalot of ooportunities to advance your careersafe place to worknever gets boringlove the friendships ive made

NIKE,"Birmingham, West Midlands",4,As a part time or full time employee pay is good and benefits are good.Normally not enough staff within work place. Meaning working overtime or getting it in the neck for not staying over previous day. 
NIKE,Finance Manager,2,Long hours and low pay compared to other companies or recently hired employees. Great co-workers; however leadership has no regard for people’s well being.
NIKE,Sales Associate,5,it was a great place to work at! everyday was a new experience and it was a privilege to work there. it is a great working place for people with a passion for sport
NIKE,Service client,5,Very good company to perform in this field because despite the day of overload to customer service the advantage and that the Nike and enormous customer service team and the work is particularly well distributed

NIKE,Insights & Analytics,4,"Worked there for 6 years. Last re-org was rough on Insights & Analytics function in EMEA, ending up being centralized in US. If you want a career in analytics it will be tough"
NIKE,Athlete (Sales Assistant),5,"Could be fast paced at certain times of the year but every day was enjoyable, money could've been better but management were always there for you and i enjoyed workng with my colleagues "
NIKE,Sales Associate,4,"Great work environment. Extremely busy, but staffed pretty well. Employee discount is nice and Nike has a lot of benefits for its associates. Management is the one gripe I had. Some were fine, but others were completely rude and condescending. One look at the schedule for the day and you knew if it was going to be a great day or a meh day depending what managers were working. "
NIKE,Sales Associate,4,met great people. fun environment but management is hit or miss. definitely some politics involved when trying to move up in the industry. overall good job 
NIKE,Sales Assistant,5,"Discounts, formations, advantages ... all guay.I had a great time in the company, it is a very comfortable way to enter the work world, the truth."
NIKE,Sales Associate,3,"My time at Nike factory in the Jersey garden outlet mall was pleasant due to the salary difference compared to other stores in the mall. However, the work environment was less than ideal. The managers tend to favor certain employees and I feel as if though they didn’t take reports or certain concerns seriously. The role has its financial advantages for a young adult but could greatly improve management to create a healthier work culture because it was a very toxic environment. "
NIKE,Vendeur,5,Work environment conducive to personal development and listening manager.Good atmosphere in this store which is well known in the region.A good first experience in the sales sector
NIKE,Commessa,5,My colleagues and the working environment was pleasant and I found myself well with everyone.This job opportunity made me grow a lot and taught me to better relate to others and to work in a team.
NIKE,Team Member,4,Nice place to work on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday it’s nice hours lovely team lovely management extremely lovely place to work 
NIKE,Sales Assistant,5,Good benefits  and good people to work with but does get really busy and management meh if they like you to be honest and just gotta work and go home to be honest  
NIKE,Product Engineer,4,"Been with the company for over 5 years within the product team so working directly on footwear is amazing and fulfilling. However, it is very much a boys club, there is a lack of diversity and mobility. Want to get paid more? Good luck. There is a lot of flexibility at work (depending on your team of course). Some managers are sticklers for wanting to be in the office Mon-Thurs and others are okay if you need to WFH for something. The campus is nice, there is always free food somewhere and it's great being able to go to the gym for free whenever you want. But after a while these perks kind of start to fade away when you realize how severely underpaid you are. Nike pays you in clout."
NIKE,Associate,3,"Didn’t work with school schedule, not as flexible as other jobs, if you dont want your career to be at nike there there’s no point of being there, save your time "
NIKE,Store Associate,4,It's a fun environment but way too focused on sign-ups and quotas. Everyone is super nice though and most of the management was very understanding. They also worked with my schedule which I appreciated. 
NIKE,Sales Associate,1,"it was great until it wasnt, they set me up for disappointment, worked monday- friday on a part time salary 😭 i wish i didnt have that bad of an experience "

NIKE,Sales Associate,2,its good just like any other retail job co workers are chill management is a little questionable but my location was rather slow so its chill good discounts
NIKE,Athlete,5,Can be a very fun place to work depending on location and management. Love the employee discount which is 30% instore and 40% online. The discount is truly what keeps me around!!
NIKE,Sales Associate,4,Fun friendly place to work. Lot of good staff and hours are flexible especially for college students looking to get some extra money. Very diverse and good atmosphere. 
NIKE,Retail Associate,4,The only downsides to working at nike as a retail associate is that it is super boring and they love to schedule you as much as possible. You pretty much get paid for standing there so it's' not too bad for a part time job

NIKE,Vendeur,5,"I grew up a lot by working in this company, great work colleagues and many advantages (restaurant tickets, bonus, reduction employee ...)"
NIKE,Material Handler,4,#NAME?
NIKE,Retail Sales Associate,2,"Low pay , management is rude the managers that are not rude look out for others on releases they pay low expect you to work 5 days a week. If you call out for being sick problem family issues problem employees have no customer service skills. It is run like a high school . The job is fairly easy but you will be a robot no empathy no compassion for employees. I would not recommend  if you are in college there is no accommodation you must eat sleep breath Nike "
NIKE,Staff Accountant,5," The company fosters a dynamic and inclusive work environment where innovation and creativity are highly valued. There's a strong emphasis on teamwork and professional development, with numerous opportunities for growth and learning. "
NIKE,Store Athlete,1,The hours would constantly change all but 2 of the managers were terrible and would try to treat you poorly for no reason. Job was repetitive and even if you had nothing to do management would be upset you were doing nothing and tell you to walk around and adjust boxes(there were no customers in the store and you've readjusted boxes all day)They wouldn't allow you to sit even with no one in the store. And there was favoritism.
NIKE,Sport research lab etw,3,The work is engaging and coworkers and friendly and helpful but contractors are treated very poorly and are underpaid. It can be a good way to get your foot in the door but rarely works out. 
NIKE,magazijnier/orderpicker,4,"Friendly colleagues, good restaurant easily accessible You get the necessary training from the right people and the wage is also fine"
NIKE,Analyst,3,"The team was really good, enjoy working there. However, if you are ambitious and want to evolve in your career, Nike won't be the best place for that."
NIKE,Warehouse Worker,5,"Good pay they are very team good, if you like to socialize this is the kinda jobs you needs good communication great pay with benefits, good job.      "

NIKE,Specialist,5,Rewarding job if you enjoy the retail space and talking to people. Role consists of leading a team and allows you the opportunity to lead your own area of the business.
NIKE,Back of House Team Member,3,Nike is great for just getting back on ur feet or getting ur feet wet kind of job not to much pay is decent for a retail gig and sometimes SOMETIMES  management are great
NIKE,Global Lead,3,The company has been  floundering for quite a few years now and it shows with repeated layoffs.  It's hard to think things will get  better when executive leadership hasn't changed and morale is as low as it is.
NIKE,Management ,3,Amazing company to work for but attitudes and egos can be a bit much.Good pay but all team athletes paid the same - should be according to seniority. 
NIKE,Cashier,5,"Great company  and boss. Every day, there is something different to do, Customers very nice , I’m very professional very good place to be they closed "
NIKE,Shipping and Receiving,4,"Nice job great discount. irregular hours but as to be expected for retail. would recommend for a first job, takes a while to move up on this company though but it is possible"
Marriott International,Bartender/Cocktail waitress/server,5,"Working at the JW Marriott in Austin was a tremendous experience. I was able excel and adapt to different situations and gain more knowledge to better my career and future careers. My management team was open and willing to help with whatever needed to be done even if it meant they had to step in and help out. Not only was my team great, but I always felt welcomed in any department if I had to go to them with questions or concerns. The hardest part of my job was working in a fast paced environment and having to maintain  great customer service as well as a vast knowledge of our cocktails, wines, beers, and liquors. I will never forget my coworkers who were always there to help out with any questions one would have and always being friendly."
Marriott International,Bartender,2,"The company itself does a good job of making you feel valued. When I was first hired I received gift certificates and notes thanking me for bringing my talents to the company. They have plenty of employee appreciation activities that shows that the company itself values you. The management, however, does not. Complaining to HR does nothing as the management is allowed retaliate against you by doing thing like cutting your hours, instead of addressing the issues that many staff members brought up. I've never wanted to leave a company so badly in my entire life."
Marriott International,Spa bölüm,1,"SPA divided by the hotel is beautiful, but the personnel ller ller boss who came from the valley people who do not behave like a person who puts a woman in the head of the presentation of the presentation of the presentation of the valley as a fast -speed Dağds grown as the boss I guess I do not recommend"

Marriott International,Guest Service Representative,1,What is the best part of working at the company?The guests who stayed at the hotelWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Poor management.  Uncooperative coworkersWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?It was like a cult.  Never experienced anything like it. Zero support from management. Poor training. They didn't want you to have a personality. You must speak in their robotic language. They wanted stepford employees. Low pay and a stressful environment. They got angry if you asked questions. If you want to feel bad about yourself work here. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful. They talk about you behind your back. Overworked. Underappreciated. Underpaid. If you want to feel bad about yourself work there.
Marriott International,Customer Service Associate,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Helping our guests with their accounts and helping them find a hotel for their stay What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Nothing is stressful if you're doing your job right and when something goes wrong there's always a way to fix the issue of the matter What is the work environment and culture like at the company?putting people first, pursuing excellence, embracing change, acting with integrity and serving our worldWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Well my typical day will look like as a Marriott Luxury Service Associate working remotely:By 10am I wake up start getting for the day get my coffee started and breakfast By 11am I'm writing important notes for work By 12pm I start my shift By 4pm I take my lunch By 1030pm I'm finished with my shift By 10:45pm I'm doing some home exercise for about 10minsBy about  11:40pm I'm getting ready to go to bed And by 12pm At the end of the day my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and enjoy the fresh air"
Marriott International,Front Desk Agent,5,Front desk is always busy! You have good and bad guest interaction. Do not take anything to the heart. Great opportunity to grow with in the company. Connect with the right people and work hard!
Marriott International,Houseman,5,"A typical day at work began with being on time (very important). Strict cleanliness codes were enforced. A fast paced approach is encouraged, but not at the expense of personal and guest safety.  Immature antics were not tolerated while on the property. A clear understanding of the day's tasks was always encouraged. Safety measures and policies closely monitored. "
Marriott International,Reservations Agent,5,"Very flexible postiion and pretty easy going.  The dowside is the call volume can be very high.  Non-stop calls.  And the job can get a bit boring because of the repetativ e nature, still one of the better wfh positions I have had."
Marriott International,Housekeeper,2,A typical day at work is they give you 15-20 rooms a day and you have too finish them sometimes you clock out 7pm !! I’ve learned nothing..management sucks ..the hardest part of the job is cleaning rooms when it’s very messy..the enjoyable was seeing your friends..
Marriott International,Front Desk Agent,3,high turnover made senior employees have to constantly train employees. understaffed so much that i often worked with just myself and the manager with 200 checkin and check outs
Marriott International,Front Desk Clerk,3,"When I worked there, they were terrible at scheduling. You would often work until 11pm and have to come in at 7:00 the next day.  Everyone would have at least one of these each week. "

Marriott International,Working Stiff,1,"Managers are friends with employees, not managers. Priority goes to friends of those in charge. Gossiping and exclusion is an everyday occurrence. Stay away from Marriott. There are other hotels to work at that actually focus on the job you were hired to do, and not become part of a catty and gossipy team of Karen's. Good luck in your job search! Just stay away from Marriott. "

Hardest part of the job is work/life balance when they choose you to go to and from a lot of different places or are required to stay over another hitch, 6-8 weeks/7 days a week, with an avg working time of 16hrs was a long time to let things pile up and left me feeling drained and stressed.

Management put you where they want you and there is very little room for growth unless you are in engineering, or know the right person in management. Schedule was 12 hours a day, often times 6 days a week. Sometimes we would work 13 days straight, finishing the stint with 14-16 hour days. It was weird because even if we got caught up on things and could very much work 8 hour days, they would force you to stay for 12. Department Managers would often work shifts like 6am to 8-9pm every day often times just hanging out late gossiping about their subordinates. There was a lot of favoritism and mistreatment of certain workers simply because management didn’t like them personally. I’m sure not all facilities in the company are not like this. This one in particular was cursed. All department managers acted like a high school click. Would not recommend. "

Reviewing the medical literature associated with visit.  Interacting with sites via phone and emails.  Then plan the rest of weeks travel plans and packing.    Then rest of week catching planes and visiting sites throughout the west.  Using laptop to review messages, reading information while sitting in airports, on planes, and in Medical offices while waiting to visit with study coordinator and research principal investigator for clinical trials."
Eli Lilly,Process Technician,1,"The saying, ""It's not about what you know, but who you know,"" holds true here. Unfortunately, this site doesn't fully appreciate the talent within its operations department, and there's a noticeable lack of diversity in leadership roles. Many of us initially joined with high hopes, expecting to be part of an inclusive environment with ample opportunities for personal and professional growth. It's disappointing that despite being situated in RTP, which boasts a rich pool of diverse talent, the company has failed to effectively leverage it. The notion that the grass might be greener elsewhere only applies to a select few who are well-connected and fit a particular mold; qualifications and experience in the pharmaceutical industry seem to matter less. If you're seeking a company that values its operations team and recognizes the crucial role they play in producing medicine, this isn't it. Instead, what we see are underqualified managers who are primarily focused on advancing their own careers, transforming the workplace into something resembling a circus. Thankfully, within RTP, there are better options available, with companies that boast seasoned leadership and a genuine commitment to their employees' success and well-being."
Eli Lilly,Team Lead,4,"I was with Eli Lilly Services India for approximately 6 years, and overall, my experience has been mixed. Here are some key points from my perspective:Pros:1. Eli Lilly emphasizes work-life balance, which I appreciate. 2. The company offers competitive compensation packages and a comprehensive range of benefits. 3. The work culture at Eli Lilly is inclusive and collaborative. 4.  The future outlook is great. Cons:1. Stagnation persists at senior leadership levels within India, particularly in commercial services. Despite available opportunities for professional development and training, career progression within the company appears restricted.2. The ambiguity in HR policies occasionally leads to varying interpretations among employees, consequently placing front-line managers in challenging situations.3. A pervasive culture of office politics and a tendency towards a ""yes-man"" mentality are notable within the commercial services space.Overall, Eli Lilly Services India is a reputable company with a strong emphasis on employee well-being and a collaborative work environment. Make sure to have a supportive and understanding manager which can significantly improve the overall work experience and career growth. "

I think it is a great company to enhance education for employees (including contract employees), especially respecting individuals and responding to diversity and compliance.Working at this company and tell me what you feel most stressed.

Excellent first work experience. "
Eli Lilly,Territory Manager,3,The management team is not transparent with a lot of changes happening. The field sales team jobs are not secure for the long term due to so many changes. 
Eli Lilly,Senior Executive Sales Representative,5,What is the best part of working at the company?You are paid to perform.

Eli Lilly,Territory Manager,4,"Lilly is a great company that is very well respected. They are one of the lower paying companies in the industry for sales but, have much better job security as a trade off in lieu of other companies who regularly have lay offs. Lilly is also widely respected for their training which many people leverage for more money with other companies down the line. Pros - job security, great benefits, summer/winter shut downs, great products Cons - lower paying, limited promotional opportunity/salary growth"

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very stressful because management only cares about numbers, not people or patientsWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Long hours, micromanagement, stress"
Eli Lilly,Scientist,1,"The company has no standards- like the Wild Wild West. The company is more concerned with pushing product out the door than quality, and the place is run as such. Management is hands-off and the training is abysmal to non-existent. There are a lack of development opportunities. Everyone is not given the same opportunities, which in turn determines who gets promoted. Lower level employees are expected to do the same as higher level ones even though they get paid less. People try to get out of their responsibilities or push them on to others. In certain departments, the employees are toxic and/or inexperienced. The site does not have good systems in place to carry out seamless production. Many errors in approved documentation that get corrected while in use. There are not enough people needed to do the work and the building can barely hold the amount of people currently there. Also Google “Eli Lilly Branchburg” “Department of Justice” “whistleblower” “OAI” “483”. Maybe other sites are tolerable but stay away from Branchburg. There are better places to work. "
Eli Lilly,Intern,5,I'm yet to start my internship but the place seems quite interesting and people seem to be helpful Management is good I've heard the workplace culture is easy going

Senior management is horrible and there’s an always.” out to get you.” mentality.  Consider Eli Lilly a steppingstone in your career.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?upper management does not have your back, and they let away with people of ethnic backgrounds, get away with things because they don’t want to face any sort of lawsuit, but everyone should be treated equally. I shouldn’t of had a threat from my manager that he threatened to kill someone who didn’t do a job for him.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?depressing and not exciting at allWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?It is a typical primary care pharma job.  It is great for entry-level, but not good to stay for a whole career."
Eli Lilly,C&Q Engineer,5,Great place to work. People there are so friendly and the environment is always positive. You learn a lot from the other engineers. 100% recommend working there

Eli Lilly,Automation/Analytics Senior Analyst,5,"respect people, and take care of employee's development and compensations are fair, also environment are very friendly.and team work is highly encouraged "
Eli Lilly,O2C Analyst,4,"Great place to work. Plenty of opportunities to move teams, lesser chances of progression within the role one you reached Analyst level as progression often means doing 200% to get that promotion. 50% WFH but depends on team. Workloads can depend, team is great, manager depends. With a good manager, workload and structures are solid, with bad manager it can be all over the place and difficult to progress. "
Eli Lilly,Consumer Marketing Specialist,5,"Would recommend overall, but culture has changed in past 10 years to be more performance driven and less people-focused.  A lot of external hires which has diluted the Lilly culture."
Eli Lilly,Scientist,2,"There is a lot that is enticing about working at Lilly such as the pay, benefits, and hardworking employees. But that just does not seem to outweigh the poor leadership I’ve witnessed. Leaders are not there to support their reports; in fact, they just use their reports to make themselves look good to higher management as they continue to make challenging demands with a tight deadline. The amount of bureaucracy and red tape is ridiculous. There are committees that shouldn’t even exist, as they truly provide that little value to the overall business plan. Communication between departments is also a huge barrier to resolving issues, causing finger pointing and unnecessary blame. The work is challenging but not in the way you want it to be. The reason it’s challenging is because of the lack in proper training. The training here is a mess and you have to advocate for yourself if you want a decent onboarding experience. I’m genuinely confused by all the positive reviews…unless they are being taken down. If leadership got their act together and weren’t so obviously greedy, maybe talent such as myself wouldn’t want to leave. "

Eli Lilly,Senior Director,4,"Lilly as an employer is top notch.  Best in class benefits, time off, etc.  Team members generally good to work with.  Lack of career opportunities in certain areas depending on your skill sets.  Over-focused on leadership potential and moving people around to build their leadership skills.  Leaves non-high-potentials floating without focus.  This company for sure creates golden handcuffs over time.  "
Eli Lilly,Analyst,4,"Great working environment, training opportunities and great people. Huge emphasis on safety and right first time approaches. The pay is not good compared to what other pharmaceutical companies pay."

Eli Lilly,Sales Associate,1,No trust in management.        Meetings about nothing.      Managers should be evaluated by the sales reps.      This would give upper management an idea of how the reps feel .   Mangers talk badly about other reps.

Eli Lilly,Sales Associate,3,"Higher-ups hire family and friends.You will be marginalized if you're not a part of their club.   Managers are scared of the ""higher-ups. ""   Especially when generations of family members control who is hired.   Nepotism is a huge problem."
Eli Lilly,Engineer-I ,4,"It's a nice company to be with and giving lots of employee benefits. It has flexible work timings, no rush in D2D activities.

Eli Lilly,Software Support Engineer,5,"A company with a good reputation and a strong focus on providing its employees with a healthy work-life balance is an ideal place to work. Such companies often invest in their employees' well-being, leading to increased job satisfaction, productivity, and retention.These companies typically offer flexible work arrangements, such as remote work options, flexible hours, and compressed workweeks, to accommodate employees' diverse needs. They understand that employees have lives outside of work and aim to strike a balance that allows individuals to excel both professionally and personally.In addition to work-life balance, good companies prioritize employee well-being in other ways. They provide comprehensive health and wellness programs, including mental health support, fitness initiatives, and stress management resources. Employee assistance programs are often available to help with personal challenges that may affect job performance.Moreover, these companies foster a positive and inclusive work culture, where employees are treated with respect and fairness. They encourage diversity and inclusion and provide opportunities for professional growth and development. This can include mentorship programs, educational assistance, and clear career progression pathways.A robust benefits package is another hallmark of such organizations, offering competitive salaries, generous vacation time, and a variety of perks like childcare support, paid parental leave, and retirement plans.Employee feedback is valued, and there are mechanisms in place to address concerns and continuously - more..."

Field operators act independently, without keeping their references informed are lambient and working culture at the company?inclusiveness, but I who am a protected category I have not been assumed nor involved according to the role covered by your typical working day at the company?

Eli Lilly,Sales Representative,5,"It was a long time ago, but I loved my job.  I walked away feeling like any doctor I go to, I want to make sure they allow seeing reps.  I feel like docs who see reps end up spending more time looking at current data and are more aware of new technologies and drugs that are coming to market."
Eli Lilly,Marketing Intern,3,The projects are very interesting and they create different activities for the interns to get to know each other. The experience and knowledge that the employee have its mesmerizing.

PACCAR,Distribution Associate,1,The benefits and lay is the only good thing about working here. They train you to follow procedures but in reality they don't care about anything but rates and numbers. And unless you have a college degree you cannot move up in the company. It is managed by a bunch of kids and the favoritism game is big here.
PACCAR,"Ste.-Thérèse, QC",2,Positive points - Excellent benefits - Pensions fund - Very structured environment - Good school for engineering and labor relations with the union good business for best practices in the manufacturer.Managers and unionized - Even executive employees must puncture in the morning and evening - the executives employees remain there because the pension fund is good and advantages are 10/10 ... But if it was not that = everyone would go in theManagers - Difficult to make a change in culture or to have innovative ideas - not a lot of respect for frameworks by union members - they believe that the BBQ replaces respect for people.
PACCAR,"Safety Team Member, MERT Member, Skilled Laborer",2,"HR will tell your business faster than the speed of lightening. Nothing is private and they will make you out to be the bad guy.  When you report having an issue of any kind, investigation or not. It depends on who you are that will or will not help you with the problem. "
PACCAR,Manufacturing Engineering Intern,5,I would recommend (specifically) the manufacturing engineering department to anyone. Lots of opportunities for professional development if you make the most of your time there. 
PACCAR,Assembleur ,4,A day at Paccar is a day like in all businesses.Yield and efficiency because we have to work for the safety of others.A well -building truck guarantees the safety of road users and strengthens the credibility of the company.

PACCAR,Quality Control Inspector,5,"My time with PACCAR has been amazing, great pay, 99% of the people you work with you will inevitably grow a pretty strong work bond with. It’s grown up work for sure, no walk in the park but for what they pay, expect equal work"

PACCAR,Financial Reporting Manager,3,"Decent Pay, work life balance. Old Systems, authoritative management. Not very conducive work environment. Join if you have a good reason like work life balance, easy commute."
PACCAR,Director of Global Accounts,5,Enjoyed the global nature of the company.   It's large but still run much like a family business.   Conservative but highly profitable.   Not for everyone.
PACCAR,Assembly Line Worker,3,It's a good place to work if you're fresh out of school or need something to do while working on yourself. The culture is not the best and managers aren't always knowledgeable. Benefits are the high point of this place really. 
PACCAR,Accountant,5,If you are though and have tolerance for frustration is a good place to work.Little high benefits compare to another workplaces.Is has its own culture.
PACCAR,Analyst,3,Seems like everyone here is overworked and doesn’t like their jobs. Onboarding is non existent and managers are somewhat not knowledgeable. It is a fine place to work with growth opportunities 
PACCAR,Accounting Intern,5,"Outstanding team with fair pay, fostering an exceptional learning environment and wonderful colleagues. Enjoyable and rewarding work experience with decent compensation. Very positive and supportive working atmosphere"
PACCAR,Business Analyst,4,"PACCAR is a great steady company. You are unlikely to get laid off, but also unlikely to get much for bonus or raise unless you move positions within the company. Many employees stay over 10 years and have a pension. "
PACCAR,Assembly Specialist,1,Management is trash from low level the higher up you go they get worse they micromanage you it gets worse every year I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone 
PACCAR,Gerencia,3,It is a good company to work.Little evolution increasing salaries and new jobs.If I recommend working here to the one looking for work.
PACCAR,Material Handler,2,"HR doesn’t care for the workers, they put on a front like they do but they’re only here to help those in management. Job advancement SUCKS, you can apply for a job just for them to tell you that you don’t have enough experience just for them to go hire a contractor or outsider with NO EXPERIENCE. They’ll give a $1500 sign on to a person with lack of experience rather than give it to its employees already in the company. With the rise of upcoming jobs in the area you would think they would show more effort in keeping their people. But I can go on and on about this place "
PACCAR,Supplier Management Analyst,4,"If you want job security, a place to learn and grow, work with good people then PACCAR is for you. The only downside is they have taken away flexibility of working at home and pay could be way better. "

PACCAR,Production Worker,1,The clock  has stopped in 1970's in this place there is no respect to diversity or equal opportunity at all specially if you are from immigrant background. You will be well paid and have a top job in this place if you are related to either management or if you have excellent and healthy strong knees and tongue so if you are the right candidate no previous experience or qualifications  required  whether you are a land Scaper or taxi driver etc you will find your self in management seats and good salary.
PACCAR,Technical Program Manager,3,Nice company for starters. Not ideal from pay stand point for north west WA. No incentive compensation . 8-5 job. Little remote work allowed. Still 60s mind set. Stable job.

PACCAR,Server Engineer,5,Paccar is a great company with many benefits. IT is run in a very structured forum with many talented peers. The organization is run with old school mgmt principles but it seems to work. 
PACCAR,Operation Supervisor Intern,5,The job is great and so is the pay. Work life balance can be tough on second shift though. The upper management can be blind to the issues of the DAs daily work and the lunch is way too short
PACCAR,Assembleur-monteur,2,"Job was fine, most of the people working there were fun, but there was a group of seasoned veteran that would make your life miserable if you were not their friends."
PACCAR,Manager,4,"I love the work that I do and the people that I work with. Once management or HR gets involved, things dive. Management is more concerned about share price and dividends and HR has absolutely no concerns with employee happiness."
PACCAR,Sr. SAP Basis Administrator,3,Pros1. Good work life balance.2. Decent pension plansCons1. Uncompetitive pay2. Favoritism at workplace3. No much room for career growth4. Growing health care premium costs
PACCAR,Assembleur,2,"The salary is correct but the posts are allocated to chance according to the forces of each, if you have the unluckyness of being strong they will push you to the end until exhaustion, the permanent employees this damn new as well as forManager staff.Some trainer employees are sympathetic but for the most part a silly air awaits you."
PACCAR,Manager,3,"Very hard to ever get anywhere when it was their way or the highway, no discussions.The local staff were amazing, very team oriented, but the demands from Corporate were high.  The demand was higher than was possible to achieve."

PACCAR,Control Systems Engineer,4,The company is slow paced stable enjoy. Lot of internal promotion opportunities and job/stream change opportunity. All engineer will try to help you in solving your engineering problem. 
PACCAR,Sr. Assistant Supervisor,4,"No future - American owned and operated corporation- there way or the high way. No respect, no appreciation, no room to grow. Just expected to do more for less.But it pays the bills."
PACCAR,Human Resources Coordinator,4,Organization which is still in continuous improvement mode and aims from high standard of excellence.Difficult to integrate into the team. Rigid Harales even for a framework
PACCAR,Manufacturing Engineer,4,"Paccar Engine Plant in Columbus, MSClean climate controlled facility.Good place to work if you have a college degree, otherwise advancement only comes with many years of service.HR is slow and hires people that know nothing, I mean nothing, about internal combustion engines. The engine plant is a diversity trove for Paccar as a whole - people will get hired to positions because they are this/that insert label.The culture is frustrating to deal with if you plan on working for engineering, quality or as a production lead - continuous low performers are not held accountable .""Why aren't we making numbers?""""They wont get off their phones and do their job!""""Hmm... Why else?""  "
PACCAR,Customer Service,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Paid retirement. That's it. Nothing else.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Toxic people in management compounded by corporate, institutional deceit.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very poor. Managers are hostile and manipulative.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Keep your head down, document everything, trust no one."
PACCAR,Assembly Line Worker,5,"Decent job, expect to work hard and dislike your manager. Sometimes it seems that it is normal but then they send out another wave of layoffs at the lowest seniority members. Even if you work 10 times as hard as the next guy if you have 3 months less than him you are out. "
PACCAR,"Columbus, MS",1,"Bias promotion system, horrible management, no guideline book to follow, no steady pay raise it’s whatever they want to pay whenever. Terrible place! Nothing more to tell but choose somewhere else to work "
PACCAR,Assembleuse,5,"Stimulating work, which allows you to learn several techniques and where you can develop and move forward in the company.The only weak point is far too intense production The employees are pushed to the maximum."
PACCAR,Supplier Management Analyst,4,"If you want job security, a place to learn and grow, work with good people then PACCAR is for you. The only downside is they have taken away flexibility of working at home and pay could be way better. "
PACCAR,Mechanic,1,if just changing parts and oil changes is your thing go  get some. anything decent is farmed out. low skilled workers 3 to a truck no accountability for anything some might like that but its a motivational killer
PACCAR,Assembly Line Worker,3,What is the best part of working at the company?Their 401k match and if you can work overtime you get double time over 10 hours on same shiftWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Management is horrible and doing almost 100 trucks a shift on a line that was built for 50What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful and very fast paced.
PACCAR,Senior Engineer,5,Smart folks. Fun to work for an automotive company in the R&D sector. Plenty of opportunity to love to other teams and many people to learn from. Good experience to put on the resume.
PACCAR,Assembleur mécanique,1,Crotte as a company.The workstations are dangerous and demand.Management has no consideration for its employees.They harass you if you are injured.

PACCAR,Distribution Associate,5,"I've been applying to this place for the past 5 years.  I have a habit of being honest and straightforward so I wasnt selected when answering questions o. The assessment.  Fail one of those and you have to wait 6 months before you can apply again. I finally got in and was hopeful for the first time in years.  But the expectations they have for you and the support they provided were seriously unbalanced.  At least in the dept I was in.  I was expected to scan inbound shipments with a quota to match.  But some of the shipments were larger and took more time to complete.  When needing a super for certain approvals, they were not around or they just refused.  I made my case for early in my probation period but no help there.  They even extended it since I was so close to meeting the quota.  But I kept on running into the same time time consuming issue, even the super saw it a few times but I wasnt provided the help I needed.  So working there is fine, its the incompetence of their leadership that I question."
PACCAR,Operation Specialist,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The respect.  They truly wanted me there and I was made and paid to reflect it.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Having the plant close for good and loosing my value and job.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?You were treated with dignity and respect.  I miss it horribly.
PACCAR,"Bellevue, WA",2,"PACCAR corporate is still living in the past. The ""Mad Men"" mindset is still true due to the chairman not ready to let ""his"" culture norms go. Unable to really be able to inspire change as senior leaders do enough to keep their jobs and are afraid to stick their necks out for their employees. Employees performance should is based on what work they do, not what they look like. Men forced to wear tailored suits where women are able to wear more causal professional attire and get away with it. Work processes are heavy in red tape, 3-6 approvals are needed prior to getting something accomplished. Very old school methods and excel heavy spreadsheets. Good people waiting around for the chairman to sell off the company so the company can be brought up to the 21st century. Or waiting for 5 year mark for a pension. Cold siloed atmosphere most of the time. "
PACCAR,Quality Control Inspector,3,It has already been a good company but for at least 5 years everything has been different and frustrating !!! when we offer ideas to improve certain production problems often we are answered that it is not possible.Oddly later we realize that they actually solved the problem with your solution but differently and much later.Like what if the idea did not come from the boss we do not accept it.Seriously often we go in circles instead of solving the problems ....
PACCAR,Vehicle System Engineer – Autonomous Vehicle Platform,3,"It is nice to work at PACCAR, to gain experience, work life balance ,  it takes time and timing to get promotions and raise, compensation/benefits are not great. "
PACCAR,Machine Operator/Material Handler fill in,5,It a good clean fun but professional work place good manager good leading team A good staff everyone work hard stay bussy working for this company was a good learning experience I love and and I miss it I mess up last time but I hoping u get to get another opportunity with them 
PACCAR,Manufacturing Technician,4,Great place to work Great staff facilities Great management Great cafeteria Work life balance Morning and afternoon shift availability Regular overtime 
PACCAR,Travailleur de chaîne de production,2,"Good pay for a job that does not require any experience/degree. Great training, clean and organized work space. Regular mass lay offs, all based on seniority."
PACCAR,Operation Specialist,5,"I enjoyed working at Paccar. The management was really fair and attentive to the needs of the employees and the company alike. There were periodic raises, huge bonuses (such as Christmas bonus), modern facilities, paid time off, one week of paid time off for Christmas, etc. "
PACCAR,Senior Project Lead,3,The management does not really care to assist  people to develop themselves. You kind of have to have a god father or continue to apply for different positions till you get to a higher level. 
PACCAR,Distribution Associate,1,Sub pay. Micro managed. Short breaks. Not culturally diverse. Heavy work load. Shady management. Speak up about issues become a target. Few opportunities to grow unless willing to move across country
PACCAR,Application Software Engineer,3,Pros-people are great-sometimes working with the hardware is fun-One day work from homeCons-old hat management style-tries to be agile but is really poorly implemented waterfall with the word agile tossed about-work from home is completely reliant on whether or not they can keep talent 
PACCAR,Assembleuse,3,"Dependent on the departments, drinking atmosphere of vacation then work especially in summer"
PACCAR,Représentant d'équipe maintenance,5,"Paccar puts a lot on the human side, he tends to train people according to their forces both for work and for the social side"
PACCAR,Supplier Management Analyst,4,"If you want job security, a place to learn and grow, work with good people then PACCAR is for you. The only downside is they have taken away flexibility of working at home and pay could be way better. "
PACCAR,Calibration Engineer,4,You will meet many fantastic people working at PACCAR and a few not so fantastic ones too. The projects at PACCAR are fun and relevant to the times we live in. The culture strives to produce high results with lean resources. It is hard to argue with the financial success of this approach but it is frustrating to work in crowded workspaces. 
PACCAR,"Bellevue, WA",5,"While some things are very conservative here, I get a strong sense from managers I've worked with and met that they have the desire and drive to implement positive and effective change. I feel supported when I have new ideas in my work group and am given opportunities to implement them. Recognition in the form of merit increases, promotions, new business/divisional learning opportunities are many. Networking is valued highly here, and does often result in new opportunities. Mentoring program helps in this area too. Lots of corporate-led training to develop skills, which I value. Since I've started, I've seen a significant effort in increasing diversity and inclusion activities and engagement, though we aren't nearly where we should be in that regard, compared with other local companies. Long term benefits and investment into employees are competitive. However, the time off amount (starts at 10 days per year, 15 after 5 years, and maxes out at 20) is lacking. 2 paid vacation weeks per year is not enough. 20 days should be the starting point."
PACCAR,Occupational Health Nurse Manager,5,"The employees at PACCAR are like my family.   They are hard working,  very intelligent and have integrity.   Management is professional and devoted.  PACCAR is team oriented, because everyone has a voice.  I will retire PACCAR."
PACCAR,Commodity Manager,2,The corporate culture is one where federal EO regulations are keeping things in check. If the executives had their way they'd fire any woman in pants and any male who enjoyed rollerblading. Salaried positions where hours in office are kept rigid out of a sense of fear are the norm. Bosses can't seem to help their juniors do things expected of them and passing the buck is nearly encouraged. A single person fielding several positions at once is common out of a systemic lack of planning or prep chalked up to being a 'lean' company. Once in a while the company gives you a beanie and some chopsticks to show they care.
PACCAR,Accounting,5,Good working environment possibility of growth.Family environment
PACCAR,Accountant,3,Low pay but stable if you stick it out. No remote flexibility makes it not competitive with our seattle companies. Need to focus on keeping your employees. 
PACCAR,Warranty Administrator,4,"Overall my experience was ok. The worst aspect we’re the ladies in Human Resources. They are extremely rude and like to cause drama, and they do not have your back when it comes to workplace issues. "
PACCAR,Operations Specialist,5,"Great benefits when  you show up on time and work hard. I loved it there, sorry my division went to Texas. Excellent management recruiting, met many very smart and intuitive people who taught me a lot."
PACCAR,APPRENTICE TECHNICIAN,5,Very good company for a long term approach. You work hard for them and they will look after you. Flexible hours if you have any appointments. Very good benefits. Training is provided to all the techs. 
PACCAR,Medewerker IT,5,A very productive but at the same time competitive work environment. 
PACCAR,Assembleur,3,"Very dynamic environment and we do not tolerate the slightest drop on the channel, some team leaders are rigid and do not want to know anything even if it means transferring you to another position without giving you the chance to improve through the action, some positions are really demanding (extremely noisy and hot despite the air conditioning).The salary is rather interesting, the environment is unionized with good contributions and benefits."
PACCAR,Engineer,3,"PACCAR is a stable company if you want to plug and chug in for 40 hours a week, hit your eight and skate every day. It's easy to blend in and do nothing if that's what you want. If you are looking to achieve this is also possible but there are definitely road blocks, including a persistent culture of ""not my job."""
PACCAR,Commodity Specialist,5,"Management cares about your goals and will do what they can to steer you in the direction of them. Like anywhere your experience is what you make of it. If you stay closed off and don’t make eye contact and don’t talk to anyone you’ll be miserable. However, if you step out of your shell even just a bit you’ll meet a lot of awesome people. "
PACCAR,Human Resources Director,1,"Authoritarian, hyper-competitive work culture. Colleagues and leaders will take any opportunity to discredit one another in order to look better by comparison."
PACCAR,Assembly Operator,3,The pay is well for the easy and laid back work that we do... if you are looking to move up at the company its more about who kisses butt the most instead of who actually works the hardest
PACCAR,Quality Inspector,5,"Great advantages, fast paced environment. Some jobs are very physical sometimes. Been working with the company for the past 3.5 years and nothing to complain about. "
PACCAR,Senior Collector (Commercial Collections),1,"Low pay,  but demands a lot. Very poor management. I would never recommend anyone to work there. Paccar has that good old boy mentality as well. That's about it!!!  This basically sums it up. "
PACCAR,Account Manager,3,I felt micro managed and the pay is not as high as other companies with similar positions. Company doesn't seem to trust employees and offer much flexibility
PACCAR,Diesel Technician,4,If you can handle the jokes and not take yourself too seriously everything will go great. A large majority of the people are great people to be around and very willing to respectfully answer any of your questions or point you to someone who can. Work flow is very slow.
PACCAR,Operations Specialist,3,Overall a good place to work. Pay is fair for the job you are doing. Management does not keep you well informed. Strict on vacation requests. They do have a pension.
PACCAR,Supplier Management Analyst,4,"If you want job security, a place to learn and grow, work with good people then PACCAR is for you. The only downside is they have taken away flexibility of working at home and pay could be way better. "
PACCAR,Hot Test Operator,4,This is a pretty clean facility.Management and company policies need revamping. seen too many people get disciplined because of misdirection of policies .Even people in mangement i seen get at least verbally disciplined.
PACCAR,Engineer,3,"The first thirty day were great as much was learned. However, after that things got a bit stale. Walking past people and saying hi often ""hi"" would not be returned. The environment was a bit of a downer. "
PACCAR,technical engineer,2,"Very conservative environment.wish people are free to exchange views, ask questions.haven't met a single person who worked more than 5 years.no one cares about anyone, I wish something changes, "
PACCAR,Accounting Intern,4,"Worked my summer internship and wow this place is conservative. If you want a steady job this a good spot, but honestly with the development in Seattle I think you can do better."
PACCAR,Engineering Intern,4,"Great place to intern but they need to work on the culture. Lots of resistance to change and technology advancement. They should hire more people who can bring different backgrounds to the table, or else they might get stuck in this stubbornly traditional culture. Even the required powerpoint template was from the 90s still because people were resistant to changing it. But I loved my internship there and learned a lot of quality engineering concepts."
PACCAR,clerical ,1,Conservative and did not handle an abusive management situation in a timely manner. CEO at the time was very problematic as well. Things may have improved over the last few years with change in upper management...
PACCAR,Picker/Packer,3,"The hardest part of the job is lifing all them heavy parts, short breaks. Good pay but you work very hard for that pay. No advancement. I'm glad I got out when I did.."
PACCAR,Instrumentation and Control Technician,1,"No body care , old employee think company belongs to them Management miserable No training very noisy environment Very lazy staffElectrician are not competent no knowledge in plcsManagement do not wncourage new coming people "
PACCAR,Office Services Clerk,2,"Nepotism, favoritism, and outdated values- they’re all here! Come one come all (just don’t expect to get very far, especially if you’re not an affluent, middle-aged white man or related to one of the execs). The details listed in the job postings are not congruent with what is actually expected of you- and it’s likely too much for what you’re being paid. "
PACCAR,"Morrow, GA",1,"Horrible horrible experience, they dont hire workers who actually have the skills to perform the job. They hire people based on current employee recommendation. The recruiter needs to be replaced so they can get real talent and stop having a high turnover rate in the Georgia distribution center. Look elsewhere for employment opportunities."
PACCAR,Assembler,1,"Work-life balanceWork-life balance at PACCAR Inc. is good.Pay & benefitsMy pay and benefits at PACCAR Inc. not equal to the danger of physical harm and physical labor required.Job security and advancementIn terms of job security at PACCAR Inc. it is unsecure.ManagementIn general, managers at PACCAR Inc. are in need of development and supervision.CultureCollaboration with my colleagues at PACCAR Inc. is good.OverallNo talent management (placement by need regardless of skill),low moral (under appreciated workers), little/no training materials (depends if the person feels like training you or not), no HR presence(like a closed door policy),favoritism(same rules dont apply to everyone)nepotism(family=fast track development)aggressive yelling by management at employees tolerated(on occasion with consent by presence of upper managment) lack of information /communication about covid19 procedures(no standard for incidents or plan of action), punishments and threats of harder phyisical jobs by a senior manager is openly tolerated by upper management(a specific team that is physically hard)  My experience working at PACCAR Inc. is an eye opener. I believed I was going to be working for a strong company with strong roots in our community and I would be proud of the job. Instead I have found myself looking for another job in the middle of a pandemic. The pay is ok, bennies and schedule are good but the environment is so toxic that I cant see myself there much longer. It is more then just a few bad eggs. It's become an unchangeable accepted way that things work."
PACCAR,Executive Administrative Assistant,1,"Depend on the management. Some manager are nice.Some managers are not and like to fire people and making people as their target to cut the workforce. Some managers have trust in you, but some managers are very micromanage and will call you every 30 minutes."
PACCAR,Assembleur de camions,4,Professional and pleasant environment.There is the right training.
PACCAR,Material Handler,2,Management is terrible. Nurses don’t practice confidentiality nor does HR. Not as strict as other plants with work. Pay is good. Cafeteria is okay. The managers are very horrible to deal with. 
PACCAR,Buyer / Materials Planner,2,Not an inclusive environment. No trust from management. They make you feel bad for leaving for a doctors appt or taking a sick day. They give you more and more work with only minimal raises. I wish there was more positive things I could say but my experience was not good. 
PACCAR,Assembleur,5,"If paccar call me to go back, I'll. Good job, good salary. Good ambiance. Good place to make a carrier with assurance. Good work. Physical work. Good schedule. Nothing else to say"
PACCAR,Assembleur,4,"In this company, we are improving day by day to make the employees work space secure."
PACCAR,Analista de Sistemas,4,"The work environment within the department is good, there is companerism and help each other,"
PACCAR,System Administrator for Various Banking Portals,4,top quality trucks. Chances to advance. Still offer a pension. Offer mentors. Will help with college. Can work at different locations.  Very structured.
PACCAR,Numerical Control Data Coordinator,5,"Production at Kenworth is a mix between high - tech robotics and hands on craft production. 
Custom manufacturing of such a complex machine requires agility and focus in engineering and material control roles. 
Expect to be challenged and to have access to personal and professional growth opportunities."
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,5,Excellent place to work...the culture is great and advancement opportunities are all over the place.
Altria,Sales Manager,5,"Lots of autonomy, life balance and pay is above average.  Company vehicle is provided and can be used on personal time.  401K benefits with employer match"
Altria,Account Manager,3,Restructures often as they balance return to shareholders. Room for advancement limited. Great training that really sets you up foundationally for if you want to leave the organization. 
Altria,Sales Manager,2,"This job was not what was sold to me during the interview process. This is a merchandising role with micromanagement from the top down.Management does nothing but so called office work and teams' calls. When management does leave the office to spend time with their subordinates, it's a day of being picky for the smallest missed activity.Management also has their clicks and uses those salespeople to try and get information about other salespeople.When you're out with your manager and you debrief at the end of the day, what is said in the car is completely different than what is written on the days report that is submitted into the system.I have never worked with a company that everything is forced, even up to the volunteering once or twice a year. I agree with volunteering and love doing it but for them to make you do it by selling it as optional is what this company is all about.If you are liked, when you go on vacation or if you're out sick, management will assign someone to help with your workload, if you're not liked, they will not help at all.Finally, they need to realize that not everyone learns at the same pace, they need to adjust to each and every individual separately.Altria from the start sets you up for failure unless you are one of the favorites who complain, the manager will crumble to their complaints.Would not recommend anyone starting their career here! It is a dying industry; they are laying off people left and right and the sales teams are targeted for a reduction in force if they are not liked.STAY AWAY!!!"
Altria,Sales Manager,3,"Altria has some great things going for it. The culture within the company is really positive. My manager has always been kind and gracious when things happen. The compensation is great for the work performed. The job is quite monotonous. The push is to sell innovative products that most retailers do not want. The company’s shift to smoke free is admirable, but has not and in my opinion will not be successful. Our products are “copycats” of far more successful products and brands. It is a grind every day. They are shifting to a global platform and will likely be laying off a lot of administrative roles. The Salesforce will be next. "
Altria,Sales Manager,4,"Loved this company until I decided I wanted to get promoted.  Then realized my manager wasn’t going to advocate for that.  Despite leading my section in most category initiatives, it never seemed to be enough."
Altria,Sales Manager,3,"I joined Altria shortly after graduating, and it gave me a great foundation to move on and fulfill my career elsewhere. Very limited growth opportunities. Great pay and benefits, but without a promotion the yearly raises are not much. "
Altria,Market Manager,3,"Its a shrinking industry due to regulations and taxes. Keep cutting resources to keep pace with decline, but workload keeps increasing. Expect each person to do more with less. "
Altria,Sales Associate,5,"Interning as an Altria sales rep offered unique insights into sales strategies and client management. Great mentorship, steep learning curve, and valuable network building."
Altria,Machine Operator,3,"Overall, the pay and benefits are great. My main issue is the high turnover rate of the direct supervision on the production floor. It makes things difficult for employees when there is constantly new direct leadership."
Altria,Sales Manager,5,"Pay and benefits are incredible, but expect to work for what you’re getting paid. However, work life balance is still there. Been in three different industries and this one has been the best one by far."
Altria,Sales Manager,4,It was a great experience but be aware it is a very structure company and you need to make sure you play the game to get promoted. It’s not just you preform well   
Altria,Sales Manager,4,"Great benefits and perks. Training is okay and not in depth. In field training is make or break and make sure you go out with someone on their “busy”days, not an easy one.  Also make sure that it is  a day(s) time when there are physical tasks to complete outside of selling an initiative or non Point of Sale tasks. Learn all the brands on your own. "
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,3,This is not a glamours sales job! You have to get dirty and do a lot of merchandising work. The training is great and managers will help when asked. Expectations for the amount of initiatives and work to be done in each account during the sales call are very unrealistic. The salary is good in comparison to other tobacco companies and the benefits are great.  There is not much room for career growth without relocation. 
Altria,Sales Manager,2,"horrible mid level management. no clear direction. they say they prioritize your personal development and the business, but the business is all they care about because it impacts their bonus. they could care less about your personal development even though they flaunt it everywhere they can."
Altria,Specialist,1,The Philip Morris side of the operations is incredible.The US Smokeless Tobacco side is toxic and upper management doesn't know what's happening on the production floor.
Altria,Engineer,5,"excellent supervisors, great team work environment. Great pay and benefits as well. 401k is unbeatable at this job. Highly recommend it to others. I enjoyed my time here. "
Altria,Facilities Manager,4,awesome people and great benefits Management was tough but fair.  have made many lifelong friends here culture was very family oriented. typical day was hectic but never too demanding. 
Altria,Sr. Manager,5,Great people. Feels like a family environment. A lot of opportunities available to grow yourself. Challenging environment with a lot of great benefits.
Altria,Sales Manager,2,"Over promise and under deliver. Sales force is inefficient and anyone above Market Manager is clueless as to what actually goes on in the field. If you were not an intern, good luck being promoted on the basis of your work. "
Altria,Sales Intern,4,"A lot of training, in person and online. Prepares you really well if you are looking for a career in sales. Company car and a lot of traveling!  Great company to intern for!"
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,5,Excellent place to work...the culture is great and advancement opportunities are all over the place.
Altria,C-Suite Executive Assistant,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great people! Everyone is nice and supportive. Benefits are extremely competitive.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?They are hybrid in headquarters, so you have to be mindful of the needs of both groups. However, that happens in all hybrid workplacesWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Supportive and strives to be inclusive."
Altria,Production Worker,4,Good benefits and pay. Management can be hit or miss depending on department. Lits of overtime available. One of the only cons is time off of work for production staff
Altria,Sales Manager,3,"Benefits are great but the company does have unrealistic expectations. The job can be amazing depending on your territory. If you're in a tough area, your numbers will reflect that. "
Altria,Financial Analyst,4,"They were all super helpful. They helped me with my day-to-day activities, and I had long projects that I had to work on with a very big group but we all worked tigether"
Altria,Retail Merchandiser,1,"Unrealistic daily goals within the huge territory they assign to you. Total disregard of a person's disability even when voiced you need accommodations. Will be ignored when you reach out for help, then turn around and micromanage you. Horrible HR help and I wouldn't recommend working for this company."
Altria,Operator,4,"Good pay, good benefits, and management isn't hard to work with but in my opinion the pay  could be better since a lot of other factories around the area have higher starting pay and better benefits. "
Altria,Sales Manager,4,"Be prepared to get dirty roll up your sleeves as a Sales Manager. The position consists of making 6-8 calls (or visits) per day to convenience & lifestyle stores to sell and merchandise the full portfolio of brands and products offered. It's not a glamorous job and it requires self motivation. The reality is that no one sees exactly what you do in a day unless you're based at HQ. If you can get beyond not receiving ""atta boys"", it really is a great company to work for. Even the most well intentioned manager would have no idea if you had a great selling conversation or overcame a big challenge. As a result of not being physically present with your team, the only success metrics are numbers. The number of calls per day, the number of hours you worked, the business metrics for IC (incentive compensation / bonuses). Depending on who your managers are, it could lead to micromanagement. The salary and benefits at all levels are fantastic, however, the lucrative bonuses and work autonomy are only at a management level. Upward promotion is difficult but not impossible. The scale tips heavily in the favor of younger or recently hired individuals. If you've been in the same position for more than 2.5 years, you're likely not going to be considered for any other role. Most of the people are fantastic and you'll never hear the end of ""it's the people"".Although, they do encourage you participate in ""stretch"" roles which consists of 2-6 month projects on larger initiatives. It's a double edged sword to take on these extra duties. You truly do come out with experience and cross functional - more..."
Altria,Electrician,5,"Was a great 8 years, Miss it. Great people. Pay was awesome with profit sharing. Had a well run training center and a Cafe. Full time nurse. Wish it was still here"
Altria,Engineer,1,PoliticsBad project Failure to select winning project Good payPoor skill development Bad for health / tobaccoSkills not transferable Good for people who know how to play politics 
Altria,Fixer operator/Associate Specialist,4,"Through my experience I have had ups and downs throughout and right now in my current situation, I am wanting to make advancement and there is no room for it at the time. "
Altria,Utility Tech,3,"This for USST, their parent company is ALTRIA.Utility Techs learn all the jobs in their department. Some jobs require more time to train than others depending on their importance in the process. If you like coming into work knowing what you're going to do every day, this isn't the job for you. Find another position.Management: You have leads and BUL's (supervisor). Then you have your manager of the department. There are a few good BUL's but most of them along with leads will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat. Its always going to be your fault something messes up. The first question is always ""what did you do?""They made a bad call and it backfired? Still your fault. ZERO accountability from leadership. Production is the only thing they care about. This plant runs like its always behind schedule. Remember this saying ""We don't make sense, we make tobacco.""There are good people there. But majority are the laziest people i have ever seen. The longer someone's been there, the lazier.Culture: Stick to yourself or a small group of trusted individuals and you will be fine. Other than that, you have middle aged men and women who are drama kings/queens. You are compensated well for your job, i will say that. Unfortunately Tobacco is a dying industryand our hours have reflected that lately."
Altria,Sales Manager,3,Great benefits and the people are collaborative. Company is going in some interesting directions. Have to be intentional about work life balance here as well 
Altria,Director,1,Nothing good to say about this place.  Management gets openly giddy when it is time every other year to layoff all of their employees.  Avoid at all costs.
Altria,Project Manager,5,"Altria is a great company.  Excellent culture great pay, and great benefits.  I spent more than 20 years there and highly recommend them.  If you are willing to apply yourself, there is no limit to your success."
Altria,Sales Manager ,5,The culture of this organization is unmatched. I’ve never felt so comfortable bringing my authentic self to work. The workload is significant and good time managment and prioritization of work is imperative to succeed. I find the longer hours at retail a good trade off for guaranteed work life balance. . 
Altria,Consultor de Procesos,1,"Total disorder in the company, there is no work plan in the projects"
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,3,"The people are great and so is the money, but sometimes the work can be overwhelming considering what you're being paid. The work culture is great and the people are nice, but the work can be awful."
Altria,Lead Maintenance Technician,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The people good environment but no golden ladder .If you do your job good company. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Fast pass constantly on the moveWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very busy plenty of overtime very family oriented
Altria,Utility Worker,5,"Not a bad place to work. Benefits and pay are a plus! It’s a Union based company and the union is weak. Although, I’d rather have one that not to have one."
Altria,Production Technician,4,"I enjoy it. Great benefits, good work environment, helpful people. DEFINITELY OVERTIME. 10+ holidays that employees get time off for. Huge quantities of erg groups/clubs to join to learn & support different cultures/backgrounds. Personal gym, barbershop, clinic. BCTGM union group that’s supportive. MULTIPLE yearly bonuses & great deferred profit sharing. Definitely opportunities for advancement. Very simple work requirements, just making sure systems stay up & running. People lose positions due to frequent tardies & call outs but as long as you show up, the possibilities are endless. "
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,5,Excellent place to work...the culture is great and advancement opportunities are all over the place.
Altria,Marketing Group Manager,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Business strategies on target in meeting corporate goals What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Maintaining consumer engagement What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very people oriented and strong department collaboration What is a typical day like for you at the company?Working together in meeting business objectives
Altria,Pre-sales engineer trainee,4,"I was a short time, with a strong personal problem that prevented me from focusing to one hundred, however they gave me the opportunity of my first job and is appreciated."

Altria,Client Services Manager,3,Job security is a concern due to declining industry. Many re-orgs and layoffs. Leadership makes poor choices that put the company's future at more risk.
Altria,Mt1,5,Great place to work so far for me different shifts and departments to choose from while working there when postings come up etc. O think it could pay more like every other job though but it’s a great place
Altria,Technician,3,Great pay and benefits in exchange for the work you do. Cons are that they own you and can be forced to work whenever they want you too. This is for hourly employees. 
Altria,Senior Analyst,5,"Altria cares about its employees. Because managers expose employees to a wide array of project types, it is an excellent place to learn, use and develop skills including leadership. Here, I have also experienced the best work/life balance culture in any company I have worked for previously. On top of that, benefits and compensation are well above average."
Altria,Senior IT Program Manager,5,Great people & wonderful place to work.                     Worked here for over 25 years.  Generous 401k benefit.   Management cares about their staff.                     Health insurance could be better.  Very high deductible of $3K annually per person.   Decent dental & vision. Incentive comp program.  
Altria,Sales Manager,4,"Great first job, I’m in the car by 7:30/8ish and get home no later than 3:30. Expected to make 5-7 store visits per day. Sometimes feel like a glorified merchandiser but with salary and 401k and car, it’s like close to a 100k package. Legislative attacks are a constant worry on the industry and our products "
Altria,Lab Technician,4,"Enjoyed my tenure thete, very professional and courteous people. Adequate training and followed protocol. Clock in and clock out was usually fine and no one pushed you to do anything extra."
Altria,Tsm,2,They have great benefits and the job is extremely easy. You will not be putting your degree to good use. There is a very bleak future for the company and i would not recommend joining
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,4,"Fast paced environment, can be a grind at times. Great people that work there. They do train you well so your experience will go a long way in other organizations. "
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,5,"The company truly understands that if their employees are motivated and happy that the business will thrive; Therefore, Altria focuses on diversity, inclusion and work-life balance. They are the best in their category. Everyone is intelligent and naturally kind.   "
Altria,Sales Manager,3,Altria can be a great place to work depending on the kind of person you are. If you are outgoing and love meeting new people and creating relationships. Altria is the place for you. The work can be challenging and constantly evolving and if you enjoy fast paced environments then you will exceed. Working in the field has its pro’s and con’s and pay scale can improve with all the work you are expected of.
Altria,"Senior Manager, Finance",3,"The pay, paid time off, and profit sharing/401k benefits were excellent, but the trade off was a heavy workload and high stress.  Managers were promoted into positions requiring them to supervise and lead a team without adequate preparation and assessment of their suitability for such a role.  This resulted in many managers with good technical skills but little ability to manage people."
Altria,Sales Manager,4,"Hard to move up in the company. sometimes retailers are not friendly. The people are very nice, HQ knows nothing about how the field works. No clear advancement plans"
Altria,Retail Merchandiser,4,"Company car, gas card, $100 towards student loans, laptop, iPhone, benefits Work is monotonous and boring but easy. This job is made/broken based on your Market Manager. Most MM are cool but there are a few who “ do to much.”  Just do your work and you will be ok unless you get an jerk as a MM. Also, inclusivity is only at the lower levels. You rarely see POC in leadership roles. There are a few but not many at all. The corporate meetings tells all. "
Altria,Consultor Senior,3,Participates in very large projects with little prepared and committed people
Altria,Sales Manager,4,Great job if you’re looking to make good money and not be over worked. Company is all over the place and pretty hard to get promoted but overall good company with great work life balance. 
Altria,Maintenance Technician,3,"Very hard to work with people there. A lot of changes are happening. Could be for the good. Wish moving up would be a lot easier. Great pay, benefits, vacation. "
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,5,Excellent place to work...the culture is great and advancement opportunities are all over the place.
Altria,Packer operator,4,"Made lots of friends who keep in touch with each other.  The company has a lot of activities you can join (teams,  etc).  The company store has pretty good prices.  Benefits are good but the prices keep going up. "
Altria,Fundamental Management/ Warehouse Supervisor,5,"A typical day at work was one to be mentally, and physically ready. One must have to be versatile and be able to manage people from all walks of life without showing favoritism and meet production. The hardest part of the job was sometimes upper management would not listen. To work with a happy group of people wanting to meet the goals of the Company  "
Altria,Multiple ,1,What Altria was attempting to do was institutionalize mediocrity. Their best leaders were trapped by compliance and the fact that they operate in an oligopoly. They pay well and you can do the job very easily at the bottom but if you are trying to do anything except just collect a paycheck and put in minimum effort you will not be rewarded and it will often times work to your detriment. 
Altria,Human Resources Specialist,3,"Total compensation has taken a backseat in recent years.  This is no longer the best place to work in Richmond, VA.  The healthcare plan offered is not competitive in terms of cost or plan design."
Altria,Sales Manager ,4,Great place to work as a recent grad or soccer mom/dad role because of the flexibility. The company takes care of you and you can get another degree if you wish to.
Altria,Maintenance Mechanic,4,The company did a lot for its employees but management on first shift was lazy and didn't want to promote anyone because than they would have to do extra work setting up training and other things needed. The managers at the company were management for many years and they all were extremely lazy and stuck together and lied for each other when someone complained about something. When the company was in limerick Pennsylvania they were there for a few years and I was there as a mechanic. The company closed and moved to Virginia and once again lied to everyone about what their plans were. 
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,3,"Used to be great, now I don't think they know who they are anymore. Just a total feeling of running in circles because half the company doesn't know what the other half is doing."
Altria,Machine Operator,4,"Longevity in the company, great benefits. Not the same Philip Morris though. They’ve hired so many college students who don’t have a clue on how to lead."
Altria,Tsm,1,"If you want a stable job with little opportunity for advancement, go for it. If you just graduated college go find something better. No room to advance at this company because they are not growing. Altria will make you feel like there are opportunities when there are not. "
Altria,Assistant Manager,5,"Altria is a great place to challenge yourself and grow as a professional. Managers/directors routinely provide opportunities to grow employees and the company does a great job of showing they care as well. Great pay and benefits, despite the longterm industry concerns"
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,3,Ok company to work for. Management is not good lots of micro managers. The pay is very good especially if you’re starting your first year and the benefits are amazing. 
Altria,Analyst,2,"The company offered excellent benefits and competitive pay. Promotion decisions are made bases on favoritism and not experience, knowledge, skills and ability. The company doesn't develop talent."
Altria,Key Account Manager/ Territory Sales,5,Great OrgExcellent leadership at executive levelMore can be expected from field leadershipFavoritism is highStereotyping is highNepotism is highBenefits are excellent 
Altria,"Senior Analyst Technology, Manufacturing Application Development",3,"Not the worst or the greatest.  They pay well.  If you do not work in Richmond you'll only be promoted so high unless you're willing to move.  Management is about average, nothing special or inspiring."
Altria,Administrative,4,"Altria is overall a great place to work. The company has fully embraced flexibility and really took care of their employees during the pandemic. There are good benefits, lots of encouragement to innovate and simplify, and a focus on diversity and inclusion. Workloads are insane, however, and grow worse each year. Significant role and responsibility growth is not adequately compensated."
Altria,NC State Transportation Tracking Practicum,5,This was a great company. They treat employees right and are respectful of all backgrounds. They teach you how to do your job correctly and set up on the path to success.
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,5,"I have enjoyed my time working here. The culture, benefits and pay are great especially for those coming right out of school. It takes work to advance but that should be expected everywhere."
Altria,TSM,5,"Best company youll ever work for. Day to day includes \visiting 6 stores out of your 150 and running down their tobacco category assuring they're compliant with our contracts. Work usually with a team of 8, autonomous role, and 3 weeks paid vacay. "
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,4,"Truly enjoy working at Altria. Company has great benefits (company car, phone, bonus). The work life balance is great. You are able to make your our schedule."
Altria,Corporate Creative Director -- Corporate Affairs ,5,"Every day was an adventure at Altria—you never knew what you were walking into. Working for a Fortune 10 corporation provided enough manageable challenges each day for daily growth. By the time I left 13 years after I started, I felt like I could work and succeed in any large corporation. Managers at all levels—including the CEO—were available, knowledgeable, and quick to help at any (reasonable) time. Work/Life Balance was extremely important. In fact, if you missed your child's game or recital because of work, you would be given a warning—family life is as important as work life. The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of the day—not because you had to stay, but because you wanted to stay. When you're given everything you need to do your job, you find it difficult to find a stopping point. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people—teamwork was organic, not forced. You never had to compete with co-workers for promotions. The company was very generous with stock, bonuses, and raises. In the end, the company was moving to Switzerland. So instead of being told at the last minute, we were given 2 full years notice. And if you had enough time in the company, you were given up to a year of severance and outplacement. I can't say anything bad about this company, and I'd gladly return if the opportunity presented itself."
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,5,Excellent place to work...the culture is great and advancement opportunities are all over the place.
Altria,Executive Administrative Assistant,5,"Altria is a wonderful company to work for. You are treated with respect, work life balance is very good, management that I worked for was great, salary and benefits are the best in Richmond. "
Altria,Retail Merchandiser Associate,1,"Expected to see 10+ stores a day as a RMA, which was very hard to meet. Was assigned close to 450 stores in multiple territories, which you have to map out and plan by yourself. All stores were different and you had to know what to do in each location. I was doing TSM work which was not apart of my job listings, TSMs make a lot more money and are only expected to  see 4-5 stores in 1 territory. 2 weeks of training, not enough to know what to do effectively. "
Altria,Production  Operator,1,This is the worst place to work. They don’t tell you in orientation that you will be working 12 and 16 hr days no work life balance the union is company owned so no help there. Stay away and it takes 6 years to top out so while you are working 70 hrs a week for 70% of the pay people that’s been there goes home everyday while making 100% of there pay.
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,4,"Benefits are well above average with company car, phone, Parental leave, 3 weeks minimum of vacation, flexible schedule when needed. Company culture is unbelievable and one of the main reasons you want to stay more than the benefits at the end of the day."
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,3,"Great first sales job.  Decent training in the beginning. After the first few years, be prepared for the boredom and complete lack of energy and nuance with management. Any decent managers get pushed out or promoted within 17 months. Zero loyalty for experienced employees.   Zero new ideas allowed and the glad handing and back patting is non stop.  Either you are the golden child or you are one step away from being offered separation. We watched the worst of us get promoted twice in a 3 month period because the correct words were said at a quarterly meeting.  All in all, its just the same ""good ol boys"" club corporate mentality. The expectation is to eat like a bird and produce like an elephant.  If you can stomach it, its not a bad place to work. If not, you can find much better places to work for your soul. No pun intended. "
Altria,Administrative Assistant,2,I worked at Altria for about a year and realized there was no place for me to move up in the company. My boss was good and the work was manageable but it didn't work out in the end. 
Altria,TSM,5,"Great place to, great culture. Lots of room for growth. I refer all my friends to work here. They really strive to make sure you have a mentor and opportunities for growth."
Altria,Maintenance Technician,4,"As a maintenance technician the pay and benefits are unbeatable, however as with most things there is a trade off. In this case the amount of forced overtime can be overwhelming 12hr shifts more weekdays than not, 8 hr days more weekends than not. You did not know if you would be lucky enough to be off a day or two for the weekend until Thursday. was very stressful at times.The money and benefits were great, saw my coworkers WAY more than my family."
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,4,"Great place to start a career. Just really need to immerse yourself and dive in because depending on your manager, they may be unintentionally a little more hands off than expected"
Altria,Sales Manager,3,Very corporate so you should expect that kind of atmosphere. All the perks and benefits that such a large company would typically give. Base salary is great if you are just starting your career. Is the product amazing? No. Are you making a positive impact? No. So if that’s fine with you it’s the perfect place for you. 
Altria,Project Manager,3,I had a great 15 year career at Altria but it was because I made it so. The IT leadership was highly conservative and to some extent biased.There was not much room for out of the box thinking
Altria,Maintenance Technician,4,"The Money at Altria is FANTASTIC!! So is the Benefits Package!! The hours you will spend at work can be Brutal at times. The people, for the most part, are Great!!"
Altria,Financial Analyst,4,Great benefits and competitive pay but the job carries a significant amount of stress.  They are trying to solve the puzzle of what that perfect future product will be once cigarettes fizzle out.
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,5,This company is filled with driven individuals with a common goal of improving themselves and the company. You will learn a lot from everyone and a great place to work 
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,1,"Great pay, no future for advancement unless you’re recently hired from college, a former intern, and preferably one of the “recruitment schools” they use. Experienced hires are hired only to hold spots, never grow or develop. "
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,4,I worked for this company in the late 90's early 2000's. I didn't appreciate it back then but it was a good company to learn how to network and sell to businesses. 
Altria,QA Inspecter,5,"I love the bonuses ,the raises and the opportunity to move up if you wanted to .Also all overtime you want.We also got free cigarettes and other free gifts."
Altria,Sales,1,"They will hire you with promise of advancement...reward isn't based on results. Favoritism, micromanagement, distrust, at this point, jobs aren't secure"
Altria,Territory Sales Manager,5,"Work was fun and challenging. Co-workers were team players and felt like part of my family. Work life balance was good. Benefits are really good, company car, 401K and medical is by far the best. The clients I worked with were sometimes challenging and difficult. "
Altria,Sales Intern,5,"I was a sales intern at Altria, everyone I met was supportive and fostered an inclusive environment. The hardest part is working for tobacco products."
Starbucks,Supervisor/Manager,5,"I really loved working Starbucks even though it was a little stressful, it balanced out. I love the customers and my team was great! I worked there for several years and I really loved it. Plus the perks and the benefits that came with the job we're really awesome. I would go back and work there again if I had the chance."
Starbucks,Barista,2,"was a hard first job i don’t recommend if you don’t have experience, staff are fake. they hired me and i had multiple face piercings then a few months later was trying to make me take them out"
Starbucks,Barista,3,What is the best part of working at the company?I'm a people person and love co.municating people.The only thing I hate is the company university of Toronto Starbucks they don't know how to value there employees all they do  is take and take but other than that they are socks.They let there employees over work and don't care at all aslong as the sales is good.Even Starbucks is lisence at university of Toronto? They are still Starbucks. Yes we have benefits but thats abut it. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Short of workers and management doesn't really care about usWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's good happy and friendly students but of course you can't please everyone
Starbucks,Barista,4,Working at Starbucks can be both fun and stressful at the same time. The turnover rates are unpredictable and can leave employees with less coverage/more work to do resulting in angry customers
Starbucks,Barista,1,"8 hours relentlessly busy non stop Little time for proper customer service I've learned how to make a variety of cold and hot drinks Management treat workers unfairlyThe hardest part of the job is lifting heavy boxes, rubbish and milk runs Working in the heat at the pool unit The most enjoyable part of the job is free drinks when working your shift and when your shift is finished 1/2 hour break is not long enough and should be paid as the job is poorly paid for the strenuous workload "
Starbucks,Customer Service ,4,"Great people, manager was lovely. Had some support when needed. Customers were lovely mostly. Training when needed if you weren’t confident in some areas."
Starbucks,Barrista,5,"Love the coffee but love the atmosphere more! Wish I could've stayed but college was calling my name. I do wish the pay was better, but at least I got my iced chai."
Starbucks,Barista,4,Lots of garbler for you shaming us which makes for great fun and fun to watch and enjoy as well and we will be there for the rest of the season as well 
Starbucks,Shift Supervisor,3,The pay is great but the environment is very toxic. Haven't got any increments for 2 years. Sometimes need to do fullday shift and no work life balance.
Starbucks,Shift Supervisor,3,"Good company to start out with, great pay, good benefits, free coffee, great people, fun environment,                                                         "
Starbucks,Barista,3,Fun place to work during college very busy high turnover rate good customers good managers flexible schedule good benefits and great discounts that can be used at any location 
Starbucks,Barista,4,Starbucks has great benefits and is flexible for students like me. There are also scholarships and opportunities for growth. Tasks at work are very straightforward and can easily be learned.
Starbucks,Barista,3,"Was my first ever job and while I did enjoy myself and make friends, management was a major issue with bullying and even with some of the other staff."
Starbucks,Store Manager,5,Working at Starbucks taught me a lot of skills to be a successful manager. Although I ended up leaving the company I am greatful for the time I was there.
Starbucks,Cashier,3,Not that good but not that bad overall would say it was not the best but not the worst and will definitively look for something best rather than still be in something worst 
Starbucks,Shift Supervisor,3,"A typical day at Starbucks can be chaotic, with constant juggling between making drinks, handling customer service, and managing the store shift—all while dealing with tight staffing and tech issues that barely function. The lack of coverage often leaves us scrambling to keep up with rushes, which can be frustrating. Despite the challenges, having a supportive team helps us push through. The atmosphere is fast-paced, and building connections with regular customers is one of the few highlights. But the long, hectic hours are draining, especially when resources aren’t up to par. It's rewarding at times, but also exhausting."
Starbucks,Barista Partner,2,Typical days are very busy. must need very good communication skills and hospitality skills. Great for working flexible hours. Very demanding work for low pay. 
Starbucks,Starbucks Shift Supervisor,3,"Was very fun at first, became a shift and the pay was awesome but the expectations are crazy for the resources they give you. Management can’t be trusted. Always coming out with new drinks to learn. Just very stressful at times. Connecting with customers is fun tho! "
Starbucks,Barista,4,"A typical day would include standard morning and night rushes of customers. I learned a lot about handling money, giving good customer service, and counting money. The management at my location was very poor, they did not have very good accessibility for disabilities."
Starbucks,Shift Supervisor,3,Over all the job was really fun and super easy. The only down side is the shifts take the most blunt end of everything. Management is okay depending on the store.
Starbucks,Barista,4,"Met some of the best people working for Starbucks! My manager was great and coworkers were amazing, but that of course depends on your store. Very busy environment and customers are mean, but you have a pretty great support system. Great job if you're wanting to go to school."
Starbucks,Supervisor/Manager,5,"I really loved working Starbucks even though it was a little stressful, it balanced out. I love the customers and my team was great! I worked there for several years and I really loved it. Plus the perks and the benefits that came with the job we're really awesome. I would go back and work there again if I had the chance."
Starbucks,Barista,2,The management at most Starbucks I know of is incompetent. They’ll schedule you outside your given hours and wildly above/below your desired hours. Was fine for me as a student but my coworkers who were living off the salary not so much. 
Starbucks,Barista and Barista Trainer,5,"This is a fantastic company to work for DEPENDING on your location. Some managers invest more time in their team than others, actually being on the floor and working with them instead of being in the office on their phones "
Starbucks,Barista,4,Sometimes management sucks but you can try transferring stores if it’s that bad. It can be pretty fast paced but the nice thing is you can pick up shifts at other stores and you get Free coffee beans every week was nice
Starbucks,Manufacturing Supervisor,4,Starbucks is a great cultural place to work . Starbucks has deep meaningful values that contribute to a healthy work environment. I would recommend anyone to work at Starbucks.
Starbucks,Barista,5,lmanagment is toxic but atleast you have benefits like health insurance and dental insurance also free coffee when ever you want but the management is like adult babies
Starbucks,Barista,4,For a young person it was a great place to earn some extra cash. I liked a lot interactions with customers and what made it really great was the team. 
Starbucks,Barista,4,"good team great place to work. customers very friendly. our boss was super nice and understanding. however, I worked there a long time ago almost 10 years ago."
Starbucks,Shift Supervisor,4,"lots of work and always busy, typically understaffed but decent discount (50% on drinks when not working and 20% on merch) as well as easy to become supervisor as turnover is high"
Starbucks,Barista,2,"Expect to be always short staffed, have to stay over your scheduled shift times, and disappointing managers who are not ready to be in their position. "
Starbucks,Barista,5,"Fun workplace, benefits are great, they also match rrsp which is great plus stocks yearly. And if you’re in school they’ll give you money but have to keep up with the grades"
Starbucks,Supervisor,3,"Loved the people that I worked with, however I eventually left because of management. I felt undervalued and underappreciate. Otherwise the job is fun"
Starbucks,Barista/Barista Trainer,3,Starbucks has changed significantly since I started working for the company. Customer interactions have since been quick and informal. You must be quick at making drinks or you hold up the whole store.
Starbucks,Barista,3,Your team can make or break the operations here. There are pros and cons to working at such a large company such as Starbucks. I feel like the job was pretty accurately advertised. 
Starbucks,Barista,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?The benefits and flexibilityand nothing else.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The barista position is not stressful, but incredibly boring.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's very corporate.  Big brother is everywhere.  All your conversations are listened to.What is a typical day like for you at the company?It's like being in prison.  Very regimented, soulless.  You are left at the mercy of customers with entitlement issues."
Starbucks,Barista,2,"The training was useless because you watched some videos, and then you made the drinks. I felt very unprepared for rush hours when I barely knew any of the recipes"
Starbucks,Barista,3,"Had a pretty cool team to work with and really supported each other whenever someone may have dropped the ball. Pay was solid, paid weekly with tips and of course a free drink or bite."
Starbucks,Store Manager,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Leaving at the end of the day. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Making every drink or taking the order or talking with customers What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Terrible, it is all about profit. They do not care for their employees What is a typical day like for you at the company?Taking order making drinks and then crying"
Starbucks,Barista/Cashier,1,"There were parts of the job I can look back on with fondness, I enjoyed creating new creations for the customers and loved my coworkers. My issue was with management, they closed our store for “renovations” without more than a weeks notice. I heard from my shift supervisor, not my manager. They relocated us to the starbucks to-go down the street from us. Which doesn’t sound too bad at first but that tiny store become overfilled with employees, leading them to consistently send people home early and the tips were of course much smaller because they were distributed amongst the 15 people working one shift. We were told we could ask to relocate from a starbucks different than this one, but my manager never responded to my requests. "
Starbucks,Barista,5,Loved working there found my best friend there and made life long friends I will always cherish my memories at the branch always busy but enjoyed the rush 
Starbucks,Barista,4,Productive and fun workplace. Very knowledgeable staff.  Good work home life balance. Great benefits and vacation. Strong onboarding and training program. 
Starbucks,Supervisor/Manager,5,"I really loved working Starbucks even though it was a little stressful, it balanced out. I love the customers and my team was great! I worked there for several years and I really loved it. Plus the perks and the benefits that came with the job we're really awesome. I would go back and work there again if I had the chance."
Starbucks,Barista,4,Management did a great job creating a friendly team atmosphere and facilitating communication. Of course the team may have changed but it is a nice location to work at. 
Starbucks,Cashier,4,What is the best part of working at the company?Nice staff good environmentPositive vibeWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Nothing stressful was feel when I used to work there What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Positive work environment feels light and less workload
Starbucks,Barista,4,"Working in Starbucks was quite a good experience, especially as a part-time employee. Sometimes can be stressful during peak hours, but it also gives you good experience in handling pressure."
Starbucks,Manager,3,Yes sales are important but what is supposed to be a fun and welcoming environment turned into only caring how many seconds it took to turn customers and how much staff you are over every 15 minutes. You can’t ask people to work 2 hours and send them home and expect longevity and well trained staff. 
Starbucks,Barista,5,"The things that stand out about this job is mostly the work environment and the benefits. I was probably just lucky finding a good team and an even better manager as they quickly became like a second family. However, after staying for a bit i began to realize just how draining the work load is mentally. Other than that the benefits are fantastic, something very rare especially for part time workers. "
Starbucks,Barista,3,Starbucks used to be a great place to work now not so much. Benefits would have kept me to stay longer but hours were reduced to less than 20 hours a week wasn't worth it without qualifying for benefits
Starbucks,Barista/Cashier,3,"The initial year I worked at Starbucks, my manager was amazing and I loved every second of the job. After changing managers, the partners were not near as much supported as I had ever been. It was disappointing, because it stayed that way for two more years before I finally lost hope and found a new job. Starbucks has potential to be an amazing place, if only the managers have their heads in the right state. "
Starbucks,Barista,5,Funny people but had loads of fun working therePeople should take this job seriously What happens in Starbucks stays in Starbucks Lot of coffee making involved 
Starbucks,Barista,4,"Lots of recipes to learn, but once you know them, it's a fun, immersive job with a fast-paced atmosphere, and delicious free drinks/food. Lots of hands made closing tasks light work."
Starbucks,Barista and Cashier,1,"Always short-staffed, needing to manage morning rush with just 2 baristas, sometimes alone. No support provided, extremely high expectations, time off wouldn't be approved even when requested months in advance. Avoid at all costs unless you really need a job."
Starbucks,Barista,2,"Terrible managers who would micromanage. Customers were on the most part, nice to us. Turnover was high and we would be constantly training new employees."
Starbucks,Barista,3,"fun crew, worked hard, clean lobby, a lot of customers, management was good.  Flexible hours but hard to find coverage. nice place to relax, lots of food and coffee"
Starbucks,Barista,3,Good environment good service fast clean fun interesting good pay good benefits good time off good area good health care good dental good vacation time 
Starbucks,Barista,4,This job is very demanding but the coworkers make it bearable and being around coffee all day is great.Hopefully you get a manager who can work with your schedule
Starbucks,Supervisor,4,"The changes at the organizational level are being very bad, they put breaks with permission without salary enjoyThe closing shifts. The work environment is good, since the workers themselves do are the most attractive"
Starbucks,Service Crew,5,Workplace is fun and helpful learning experience for those who needs to learn about the work and was abke to learn                                                      
Starbucks,Barista,2,"mentally draining. customers can be rough as expected, but the worst part of the job are the supervisors and coworkers. When the whole store knows there’s a supervisor who can’t deal with stress or new people, something should be done so they don’t continuously create a toxic workplace. "
Starbucks,Cashier,5,"Working as a cashier in a fun and productive environment has been an incredibly rewarding experience. The atmosphere is always lively, with supportive colleagues who make every shift enjoyable. I love interacting with customers, as each day brings new faces and engaging conversations. The team spirit here fosters collaboration, ensuring that we all work together efficiently while keeping the energy high.Management encourages creativity, allowing us to implement fun promotions that not only boost sales but also create a sense of community. The fast-paced nature of the job keeps me motivated, and I appreciate the emphasis on both productivity and enjoyment.The flexibility in scheduling also allows for a healthy work-life balance, making it easy to manage personal commitments. Overall, this role has not only improved my customer service skills but also provided me with lasting friendships and a sense of belonging in a vibrant workplace. Highly recommend this position!"
Starbucks,Shift Supervisor,5,Good benefits for the partners (employees) good working culture and environment. You’ll learn a lot. The higher management always consider the insights of their partners. 
Starbucks,Barista,2,"when training, there was never support and always different people telling me a way to do things wrong vs right and would change depending on who was training me. when i didn’t have my trainer, no one was happy to help and saw it more as an inconvenience. i had gotten harassed/bullied by two separate ladies in the manager positions and nothing was done about it. not enjoyable at all, everyone is very cliquish and mean"
Starbucks,Supervisor/Manager,5,"I really loved working Starbucks even though it was a little stressful, it balanced out. I love the customers and my team was great! I worked there for several years and I really loved it. Plus the perks and the benefits that came with the job we're really awesome. I would go back and work there again if I had the chance."
Starbucks,Barista,2,"Don't expect to be recognized for any effort you put into the job—especially not longterm. You'll be putting in the maximum amount of work while your coworkers stand around picking their noses, but it'll be you who gets called out for slacking for so much as being seen changing directions on a path. It's really up to your manager. Coworkers are petty, managers pettier 20-30somethings trying to feel something. It's really common to see one person singled out, and when they quit or end up separated, they'll just move on to the next.It's impossible for a company this huge to keep tabs on how one in thousands of stores are run, so they'll always get away with it, no matter which channel you take the fight to. Benefits are fantastic, wage scaling is also great, but I wouldn't consider it worth your mental health. This company used to be something special, used to really live up to its values. But that was almost a decade ago, and maybe the one store was a diamond in the rough—an anomaly in a slew of abuse.The work is fun and busy, and the customers can be great, but in recent years, it's the majority that have become entitled and unkind and honestly, as a company, we've only enabled that. More than anything, I enjoy interacting with customers, so this change has put a damper on a lot of the joy this job used to have attached to it.tldr; it's fine, but the culture itself is becoming sick to its roots and I don't feel it will ever recover, unfortunately. Come grab your tuition reimbursement and go, quickly."
Starbucks,Supervisor,3,"Sbux is a good workplace for people looking for a flexible schedule, but the management team's leadership is weak. If your store manager is responsible and has leadership skills, you might enjoy your journey at sbux. "
Starbucks,Barista,3,"For a beginning barista job, it's not half bad. Prepare to be slightly overworked, keeping in mind that  tips are not amazing. Would I go back? No, but it definitely taught me work ethic."
Starbucks,barista ,5,It was productive and flexible. Scheduling was always to your availability and training was easy. Learning how to make drinks was good. Talking to customers and taking their orders wa also fun
Starbucks,Barista,1,"It's always better to support local businesses. There's a lot more I could say about Starbucks, but the research you can do on your own is worth it..."
Starbucks,Supervisor,4,"Overall satisfied, wired schedule,Working at Starbucks is fast-paced and dynamic, with a strong focus on teamwork and customer service. Great place to develop communication and multitasking skills. "
Starbucks,cashier,5,I loved it we would make coffee and the customers would buy it and at the end of the two weeks I would receive a paycheck!! And then I got a ten minute break. 
Starbucks,Shift Supervisor,3,"There's really good benefits, and RRSP match - but if you're following procedure and doing everything to Starbucks standard, your gonna burn out in a few years."
Starbucks,Barista,4,good experience the manager was really nice with me. But sometimes it is hard to deal with the amount of people coming to the coffee shop and had to deal with not good people
Starbucks,Barista/Cajero,5,"You get to open a bar, beverage preparation, bar cleaning in detail, food preparation, collection in cash register one more than anything learns about patience and treatment of customers because the most difficult part of work is arrogant is the work is theEmotional burden that the client is right, so it is wrong, the fault will always be the collaborator"
Starbucks,Barista-4.adam,3,"I waited for 1 year to take the SSVlik exam as a result of 2 points missing by giving the exam.If your mouth is a good word and if you are trough, this process may not result for you.The customer is always right, even if the customer attacks you, you will probably be fired if you raise your hand.But during the shift, MM and SSV, which makes all kinds of irrelevance, nothing happens.It is employed like a dog and the minimum wage is given.220TL Daily Food Fee (October2024).We have a morning and evening service when you get into your home, but you look at the morning service was removed.1000TL fee for the road.Good aspects of 30 %personnel discount (also the right to define 2 relatives) daily two tall drink right, 1 core coffee per month.You can't wear all kinds of clothes, but now you can wear all kinds of clothes.The same for jewelry.You throw the empty cups in the cafe while making coffee in the bar while one of the guests can come and call you because the table is very dirty.You are responsible for all kinds of detail cleaning of the bar.Mat broom dusting orange machine cleaning esp machine cleaning Food cabinet cleaning furnace cleaning and these are the work done by 1 person made daily.You will understand that the barista do not enter the cleaning officer you can make coffee in your free time.SSV and MM also smoke in the cafe and play by phone"
Starbucks,Specialist,3,Expect to be worked hard. Expect to have the expectations that are really high. Expect to not be recognized in any valuable way other than pizza parties. Don’t expect grow.
Starbucks,Manager,4,"Great team, great support and fun environment! Our DM was fantastic, always educating and inspiring us to be at our next level. Flexibility was for everyone, this location works as a cohesive force!"
Starbucks,Barista,2,"starbucks was wayy too cruel despite me being 16, i wouldn’t recommend it to ANYONE. the ‘training’ (if you can even call it that) was so nonexistent that even the managers had no clue as to what was going on. a mess. "
Starbucks,Part time barista,3,"Free staff meal and drink provided, staff discounts, fun way to pass time for students, great opportunity to learn coffee knowledge. Train your confidence in speaking"
Starbucks,Barista,2,they have very bad management. This say they are hiring but they never get back to you no matter how many times you apply or give them a call. It is crazy.
Starbucks,Barista,3,"This is typical for most jobs, but the upper management at Starbucks is the most inconsiderate group of people I've ever had to work under. They do not care how badly the store is struggling (there have been times we worked without wifi, lights, or water for hours/days), they want you to be their unwilling shields against terrible customers. "
Starbucks,Barista,5,I have loved working at Starbucks so far and have had such a good experience but the morning or lunch rush hits it can be super stressful and on top of that the customers can be extremely rude .
Starbucks,Barista,1,"Starting from the fact that a working day at 4:30 am in dangerous place, with people circulating dangerous, in my working period I don't think I have learned much if I don't just think about myself that it is what happens in my specific seat ofStarbucks. The management is bad, the manager does not do his job for him we are only arms and numbers.It makes veiled blackmail when your opinion is different from his.The most difficult part of the work is to be in a continuous state of stress caused first of all by the work load and according to the behavior of the superiors.The only pleasant part is the company of some colleagues."
Starbucks,Barista/shift Supervisor,2,Extremely busy makes day go by fast.Tons of Knowledge on coffee!I had an amazing supportive store manager the beginning of my time there. I also had a manager that was irresponsible because of favoritism.
Starbucks,Supervisor/Manager,5,"I really loved working Starbucks even though it was a little stressful, it balanced out. I love the customers and my team was great! I worked there for several years and I really loved it. Plus the perks and the benefits that came with the job we're really awesome. I would go back and work there again if I had the chance."
Starbucks,Barista,1,Upper management does not care about its staff. You are there simply as a prop to make a drink in the most efficient way possible. You feel like a cog in a machine.
Starbucks,Barista,2,not  a bad job great pay and tips highly recommend for extra hours for anyone can work as many as needed juat need to communicate well with managers. 
Starbucks,Barista,3,"You get to learn a lot, meet new people. Sometimes they’re a bit rude and dumb. Making the drinks are pretty fun, my favorite was doing backups though. Especially when I don’t feel like talking. Management was pretty bad at this location."
Starbucks,Barista,5,"Good place to work, nice environment, flexible schedule based on your needs,  Working at Starbucks is a great experience! The team is supportive, and the fast-paced environment keeps things exciting. Plus, the coffee perks are a bonus! ☕️✨"
Starbucks,Barista,2,"Chaotic to say the least. Very all over the places, leads have favorites and make it very clear. SM is super nice but again very chaotic and all over. "
Starbucks,Supervisor,3,"It’s fun , and it’s really fast pace with a lot of information. Take your time to learn. Store managers definitely make the experience good or bad. Feel out your store manager in the interview. "
Starbucks,Coffee Barista,1,Very fun and happy pace to work I loved going into work everyday. It was very fast paced and not great pay. Only good for a temp job. Insane goals we are supposed to meet
Starbucks,Store Manager,4,"Good labor climate, market salary, growth and internal development, continuous training, corporate discounts, developing a lot of commercial management and equipment management"
Starbucks,Barista,2,"While the benefits and pay are decent for a part time food service position, the barista position usually comes with a load of stress and needless confrontation."
Starbucks,Shift Supervisor,5,Starbucks was my first job and had allowed me flexibility as well as overtime. I am very grateful for everything I have given to my career with the company as well as what the company has helped me with to develop as a leader.
Starbucks,Starbucks Barista,4,"after working for the company for 4 years, I would say it is definitely a fast paced environment but filled with lots of opportunities and connections with both customers and fellow employees that become more like family. You will get a week of intensive training both hands-on and video training as well. once you get on the floor you will make multiple drinks at a time while managing a organized environment. your coworkers support you when necessary and is all in all a great place to work. you will be taught how to efficiently get customer orders out while providing the best service to customers. I would say the hardest part of working for starbucks is calmly dealing with customers who may scream, throw things, or cause trouble and having to get a manager to help"
Starbucks,Barista,3,"We went through 2 GMs in the short time I was there. It was messy, and communication was sporadic at best. Training was at least well done.  But everything else was questionable. "
Starbucks,Barista,4,I was pleased to work in Starbucks and I played a pleasant work environment.The Headquarters and Companions 10/10.Felxible schedules according to my studies.
Starbucks,Barista,3,"The perks of working for Starbucks are great - which are set by corporate, but the management's style of scheduling is very chaotic and never consistent. Why ask for availability/preference and not utilize it?"
Starbucks,Barista,3,Not a terrible place to work at but could be better. Not too mu h care in what you serve and it can be toxic at times. Although you get what you applied for 
Starbucks,Shift Supervisor,2,Mangment don’t care about you or ur work ethics . Quick to push you out if anything inconveniences them . They don’t worry about your health or well being . Loved working there very great fast pace job but the management did what they wanted . No real leaders 
Starbucks,Store Manager,1,Used to be a great place to work. Company has gone astray with too many expectations and little time. We are expected to do a lot with little labor and expect results 
Starbucks,Barista and Barista Trainer,5,"Classic barista pros & cons. Partners and customers make the job, crafting beautiful drinks for beautiful people makes my day. Love seeing people's pets in the Drive Thru. Karens are unavoidable but do your best and they will do their best too."
Starbucks,Barista,5,"I liked working here, friendly staff. It gets really busy so don’t work here if you’re not up for that environment. Worked in a lowkey place so im not sure what the busier places are. "
Starbucks,Employé polyvalente de restauration,1,"They make Green Washing and they do a lot of favoritism, managers are hypocrites, you are paying like anything, sometimes the salary is badly paid, the only positive point is the colleagues and again ... you mustFirst change in the locker room and then beer your presence (which is out of the law), it is rats they pay very attention to their expenses like this they were not peter of money (they do not paytaxes).They always put you in competition with everyone.They send that the new ones in cooking, cleaning the toilets, the floor of the room (the most boring stains) in short run"
Cummins,Diesel Technician 2,4,Worst place I’ve worked in my life. I’ve had a gun pulled on me at a previous job and I’d rather have that then work here. Culture of the job is alright. Techs are normally good. Managers make it awful. Typical day starts with you clocking in on your laptop exactly on time because OT cannot happen for anyone not field service. Get your work order and hope the service writer put down the correct information (wrong information gets put on the work order a lot). Grab the keys and pull it into a bay and do your job. Management is awful. No accountability and brushes everything off on techs. Many times techs had to manager and GM job to keep customer satisfied. Hardest part of the job is the management. If they don’t like you they give you bad jobs and make life miserable. 
Cummins,Several Positions,2,"Your average corporation. Extremely busy, inundated with requests at all times.  Wants every customer satisfied and yet does not provide enough support or training to do so.  It could be an excellent place to work but the ever changing org charts and job requirements were beyond exhausting to keep up with.  It felt as if there were more managers than customer facing employees. A lot of micromanaging.  Also a lot of favoritism and nepotism.  Everyone seemed to know someone before they were hired.  I completely burnt out after years of working here.  The constant demands and drama on top of extreme stress just wasn’t worth the slightly above average pay to me."
Cummins,Electromechanical Technician,4,"Great Company to work for. Great benefits. Great people. Great work-life balance. Great extended coverage. If H2 industry goes big, this is the company you want to be into. "
Cummins,Jr. Shop Manager,5,I well know about Cummins India manegement and politics that is too good and healthy connection with the employee.they keep strong realition with employees .
Cummins,Field Service Technician,1,Management at cummins is very poor. They don't know how to care for the customer or the technician at all. They would rather force you to stay in a toxic environment and not give you a better situation because that manager is gonna lose money. And managers in the fspg role really don't care about their techs at all. 
Cummins,Key Account Manager,4,"I personally could not advance because I did not come from a technical background, so my only alternative was to move out or to do the same job for decades (and I was too young to do that). I particularly liked their approach to diversity and the caliber of the business that they handle. Very stimulating."
Cummins,Line HR Administrator,5,I've been with Cummins for over 5 years now. I really enjoy the culture and the people I work with and for. I highly recommend. Benefits and Time off are great as well.
Cummins,Mechanical Designer,3,"Overall, the company is OK. Workloads are unevenly divided. Management hires ineffective people time and time again. Extremely inefficient place. Rapid hiring and then layoffs. People were nice and friendly. Benefits and pay was average. Product is good but execution is terrible. Need more effective people to see things through."
Cummins,Chemical Engineer,5,The management really cares about professional and personal growth. The people here are very friendly and you never feel out of place. Pay is mediocre but they do have decent benefits. Could do more with some transparency.
Cummins,Head Talent Acquisition,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Great work culture with amazing values.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?there is nothing stressful about working for Cummins.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Cohesive, collaborative, respectfulWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Planned, organized, enjoyable and enriching."
Cummins,Welder/Boilermaker,4,"The most easiest welding job ever with the highest pay in VIC. At first everything looks great from the surface but too much internal politics going on which you’ll realise later. If you want to make good money doing the same thing over and over this job is for you. But they hardly offer full time job. Some people there are working more than 3 years in casual rate. And the full timers think they are the special ones of the company. More casual workers than full time workers. But have to say pay is really good even for non skilled labour, higher than anywhere else. "
Cummins,Material Handler,5,What is the best part of working at the company?My best role in n cummins was learning about the company and working with my co worker as a team player and what was important to the company What is the most stressful part about working at the company?My stressful part was when sometimes short of staffing but the work got done What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work environment was very good and learning more about the other culture was good What is a typical day like for you at the company?Begin at work everyday and always on time cummins made my day

Cummins,Validation Engineer,4,"It varies from building to building, but for the most part, things are very organized, and work-life balance is present unless you are an hourly employee. There are plenty of opportunities to grow as an engineer, with raises every year and a promotion every two years if you meet expectations. The downside is that it's a corporate environment, which means you could get fired regardless of how long you've been with the company."

Cummins,Automotive Technician,5,"The Organization is made up of different departments depending on each other to make the progressive engine building flow smoothly in the MRC workshops. There are collaboration meetings among departments to plan Production ahead.  Employees understand each other well and work together cordially. The company service the Mining, Automotive and Power generators, which all sectors are very demanding and makes the nurture of our business complex that's keeping us standing/responsive always. Awin for the Mining companies we service is also a win for the business that also means good year after compensation to the employees "

Cummins,Remanufacturing Technician,2,A lot of forced overtime. They expect you to hit a certain production number while machines are down. You’re doing a lot of work that can injure you. The management is very nit picky about petty things. 
Cummins,Welder/ coordinator ,1, I have nothing good to say about management. They don't care about your work ethics. They care about your home life. If they see you as a threat to their jobs they will find a way to get you out.
Cummins,Production Operative,4,The pros out weigh the cons overall not a bad place to work I would recommend going for a position if you haven't already tried Cummins as a company. 
Cummins,Machine Operator,2,You’ll never have a proper life at home working here no matter what position you choose unfortunately. Work is super easy but machines constantly break down leaving you nothing to do for hours throughout the week. Pay is pretty good as well but you’ll more than likely work 10 days on before you get a day off

Columbus,IN is a very nice little town to work, good place to raise a family, very secure and quiet. "
Cummins,Product Manager,5,"Relaxed environment with growth opportunities in all areas, annual bonds and Super Bueno Complementary Bonds.IPC and Bonus salary readjustment"
Cummins,Financial Analyst,2,"While I am so grateful for my experiences at Cummins, I wouldn't recommend staying long-term. Consistent layoffs will Ron you of valued colleagues and those left are too stressed. Hard to see the culture I once loved fall apart. Good managers makes all the difference!"
Cummins,Shipping Clerk,5,"Fast paced and heavy lifting and a lot of fun .I learn a lot of different positions, and a lot of safety trainings Good management.They  treated you like a family.Shipping is the hardest,  a lot of pulling, packing and then do the labels and invoices. The most enjoyable is when everybody done the orders on time, then reward comes. "
Cummins,Operator,2,Cummins is a great company to work for as far as benefits and stability. The pay is not good and dealing with managers that show favoritism is hard to deal with everyday. Manager basically told us it’s a dead end.
Cummins,Coordinator/Supervisor,3,    Lack of recourse for poor performance. Job insecurity Lack of communication w/the actual manager on duty that knows the weekly goals to explain to staff . Change In Staff or roles constantly 
Cummins,Machine Operator,3,Cummins is great to make fast cash but the work life balance is so bad that for younger employees without home lives figured out there’s not enough time outside the building to even see family let alone starting one. Managers are very biased choosing favorites to be more willing to work with. As well there is a lot of drama and high stress within all corners of the plant  
Cummins,Sales Associate,3,Coworkers are nice but management does not care about you or customer.  Used to be so much different.   They will lose more customers because they go to the dealer who wants to help customers.
Cummins,Accounts Payable Analyst ,5,One of the best companies to ever work at! Their induction programme is amazing and equality is valued. HR is amazing and supportive. Staff are trusted and respected. 
Cummins,Production Operative,2,"Worked on the line at Cummins for several years repetative  tasks day in day out, management like to change shift patterns a couple of times a year at the shortest notice allowed,  leaving people stuck if they already have holidays and child care in place. Team leaders and shift leaders are often egotistical and have their own groups of favourites. HR and the union are for the company not the employees"
Cummins,Field Service Technician,4,"It was good, they’re so big on safety , co workers are awesome and they love to help you if you have any questions, I ended up leaving for more pay, OT is available sometimes "

Cummins,(Logistics Operations Leader),5,All good but they need to promote individuals who are already in except hiring new ones for the role.Company celebrates the progress of every individual but rarely internally you get progress. Salary hike not good every year.
Cummins,CPI Applications and Customer Engineering Product Engineer,4,"Working at Cummins was a great experience. I had a laid back and caring manager who helped me learn what I needed to perform my job, the culture in the current product division was collaborative and I had good connections with lots of people, including in the Cummins Toastmasters Club.  My work was in addressing quality issues, and my coworkers were eager to help me learn the ropes. The COB is also an excellent work environment, though it can feel sterile."
Cummins,Auxiliar ,3,"Company is very outdated in benefits.Employees are overloaded and some unpaid leaders.Old and plastered processes, with the opportunity for improvements"

Cummins,Supply Chain Analyst,4,Good place to work and good benefits. It is not difficult to move internally. Transparent company with young managers. Their low experience in leadership can cause gaps in the annual evaluation.
Cummins,Service Technician,4,What is the best part of working at the company?The benefits and training opportunities What is the most stressful part about working at the company?It’s a big corporation and many chains of command and rules to follow also at the concord branch the service department is managed poorlyWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Inclusive and friendly.

Department’s fighting all the time and favoritism for some employees What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Woke! They care more about how you identify than inventory levels What is a typical day like for you at the company?Toxic! Management is poor, little to no direction"
Cummins,Marketing Communication Manager,3,"My direct team were a pleasure to work with, but when trying to build stakeholder relationships with cross functional teams there was some stonewalling. It felt like most teams worked in silos and didn't have a lot of trust. There wasn't much opportunity for low level employees or 'seniors' to progress. Management didn't tend to encourage promotion, because there was zero budget to offer a pay rise with the promotion. So it felt like promos were just no talked about. I had a great manager who tried to help us grow through external learning opportunities and team building. But it was disappointing the broader company had zero dollars to put into people. From an employee perspective, I think the company changed significantly when Tom left his position as CEO. All the good stuff that made Cummins great for workers, seemed to come to a halt. It was just superficial things like ""free"" coffee, lunch, birthday cakes etc. once he was gone. I'd rather trade a million ""free"" food rewards for actual career growth and mentor development. For a multi-billion dollar company, they need to step up their remuneration offerings. At the present (2024) it doesn't compare to other large companies. Make sure you negotiate a good salary BEFORE you sign your contract. You won't get a pay rise for a few of years! "

Cummins,Mechanical Engineer Associate,3,"Good after college job, advancement is difficult right now. Best to move on to greener pastures after getting some experience under your belt. Which is what most people seem to do. "
Cummins,Service Advisor,1,"You can be a high performing employing doing the work of 2 people but when it comes time to do the layoffs they do every 3 to 4 years, they could care less about work ethic or how long you've been with the company. It is a ton of corporate bs, they want you to think they care but upper management simply wants to pad their pockets and will do anything to make that happen "
Cummins,wharehouse operative,2,"Working at cummins i have learned one thing your job security is not guaranteed i started out as an worker for dhl within cummins just as i was almost finished with my probation cummins decided to take over dhl and my probation had to start over and then just as my probation was nearly over for cummins itself they gave half the staff redundancy leave the salary is oke its not great but its average management doesnt take you seriously within the work force there are groups of people (coworkers and management ) that are mates outside of work and within work domt treat everyone equally if you dont know them outside work there is no progression avalible in positions at cummins it is said everyone eventually gets trained on different vehicles ( reachtruck , counterbalance, ect) you wait 12 weeks to get a lesson ( if your lucky ) and you can still work as hard as you want do over time as much as you want it is never good enough because like i said your job isnt secured sure cummins pays you well enough but they drop you without a notice period."
Cummins,Grill Cook,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Absolutely nothing. Communication was bad. Hours were moved around a lot. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The bosses. They never communicated with you what was new. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic. Stressful. Unreliable. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful. Doing other people's job and not getting paid for it.
Cummins,Associate,3,Temps come and go they need to hire a couple permanent people that are experienced and we should be good. We need more food people but instead they hire tempa for a couple months for cheap. one hour lunch

They have a great team environment and mentality What is a typical day like for you at the company?I was field service so it consists of driving to job sites and preforming tasks"
Cummins,Diesel Technician 2,4,Worst place I’ve worked in my life. I’ve had a gun pulled on me at a previous job and I’d rather have that then work here. Culture of the job is alright. Techs are normally good. Managers make it awful. Typical day starts with you clocking in on your laptop exactly on time because OT cannot happen for anyone not field service. Get your work order and hope the service writer put down the correct information (wrong information gets put on the work order a lot). Grab the keys and pull it into a bay and do your job. Management is awful. No accountability and brushes everything off on techs. Many times techs had to manager and GM job to keep customer satisfied. Hardest part of the job is the management. If they don’t like you they give you bad jobs and make life miserable. 
Cummins,Factory Line Worker,4,"I loved working everyday, I learned so much, my boss let me go because I had a problem with my hands, and I had to call out of work and go to the doctors. I had a doctor's note and everything he still let me go. It was the best job I ever had and I was so sad to go. "
Cummins,Engineer,4,Company seems to be in a culture change currently. Business is cyclical so layoffs happen every couple years. Pays well. Insurance is apparently expensive with high deductible but nothing out of norm.
Cummins,Manufacturing Engineer,5,Great place to work in advanced manufacturing setting. Expect typical corporate structures associated with its large companies but they do well organizing and compartmentalizing.  
Cummins,Technical Support Specialist,5,"You get out what you put in, I started as a in shop technician, then field service, then technical support, then a technical support manager. Put in the effort and your growth is pretty limitless. Time off is very generous especially at 10 years of service. Definitely a company to stick with"

Cummins,Maintenance Technician,4,I enjoyed working there but over the years the management has gotten worse. Work long hours and pay is average. Took years to advance into maintenance due to them not hiring within.
Cummins,Operator,5,I enjoyed my time at Cummins and while I didn’t stay there it was a nice place to work and the work wasn’t too demanding. If I learned anything from this experience it would be that I need to work closer to home
Cummins,Technician,5,"Awesome place, great staff and they listen when you talk to them about issues. The diversity of equipment is fun to work on and expands your repertoire. Great place 10/10"
Cummins,Maintenance Lead Technician,5,"There's always a lot going on, it can be stressful at first, but it's worth it.  Once you get a rhythm it's not bad.  Lots of overtime opportunities and double time on Sundays and holidays.Unless you're in maintenance you'll have most holidays off.  If you're in maintenance you'll make a good paycheck on holidays. Definitely a good company to work for and the pay is hard to beat.Overall there are lots of avenues for advancement, though none of them quick. Still overall highly recommend working here. "
Cummins,Senior Software Engineer,4,Good Company to work for. Its in a small town which feels it is out of nowhere. The work environment depends on the team you are in and especially your manager. 
Cummins,Area HSE Leader,4,What is the best part of working at the company?The variable compensation bonus. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lots of global eyes on the company. Compliance to standards is not optional. There is a lot of travel associated with my role that was not communicated to the degree it is occurring. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Welcoming environment and a culture where all are expected to do that right thing. What is a typical day like for you at the company?I feel like there is an absurd amount of administrative work in my role. To the point I don't feel like I get to much problem solving.
Cummins,Assembly Line Worker,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?The hours are good, the flexibility of time off is great. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The job itself..it’s hard on the body.."
Cummins,Service Advisor,1,"Though the Branch has some good managers, Cummins overall doesn't value its employees or help them succeed. It's all about the Corporate push and meeting unreasonable KPI's when Customers and employees are unhappy and should be the real focus. "
Cummins,Transportation Specialist,5,Biggest blessing working for Cummins.Hate they made us move I missing working with Cummins biggest blessing working with Cummins if you ever have the chance to work here go .
Cummins,Assembly Line Worker,2,What is the best part of working at the company?I have not found a best part to working for this companyWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The most stressful part of this job is having to work overtime all the time and working with people that don’t understand your language What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Layed back sometimes to much and working on the lines they always push for you to do more but no pay to compensate for all you do
Cummins,Parts support Advocate LVL1,3,"Team I was hired for was a brand new role, We  pretty much invented the way it was done, After a while Cummins decided to send our jobs to a team in India. We were tasked with coming up with the training, and trained the new overseas team to do our jobs. Cummins then offered us a choice, move to parts, or find alternative employment.  The software that this company runs on is easily 30 years old, not user friendly, not reliable, and about as clear as drywall to use. For example, just to check availability of 1  part number it has to be entered into 3 different systems. They provide an online manual to help you perform what should be basic tasks, that is about as long as War and Peace, and written on par with Chinese translated VCR instructions. nothing about it is intuitive, user friendly, reliable, or efficient. All the while the company micromanages every aspect of every call, including scoring you on how long a call takes while trying to navigate the antiquated systems. I have been told multiple times there is no real training aside from the basics because every situation is different and the systems are not straightforward enough. If you are looking to advance, it appears to me that it takes at least 6-8 years before anything will happen, I have asked for transfer to different departments and essentially been ignored and told try applying, good luck. "
Cummins,Associate,5,"Easy place to work your way up. Managers are usually understanding of what you want and will help you get there. Overtime is what you make of it, it’s there if you want it. "
Cummins,Opérateur de production,2,"Stay in an interim 18 months, do not listen to ""we say"" take your biff with a maximum of bonus and go home.You will not draw anything from this company which makes believe in ""continuous improvement"" and ""good care of employees"" the chiefs are useless and many sub -chief who are useless and that on all lines.The operators know the machines better than the processes and yet we do not listen to them."
Cummins,Sales Training Manager,4,Lots of meetings.  Too many meetings.  Flexible schedule but needed due to so many meetings.  Almost all decisions are made via consensus which makes getting things done take longer.  Hardest part of the job is managing work life balance.  The company is stable and doesn’t reduce workforce very often as the teams are already pretty lean.
Cummins,Unknown,5,"They take their culture seriously, their plans do not only work in papers, but in real life too. When they say it's a safe place, it really is. The only downside is the lack of growth opportunity if you do not work with their main services"

Cummins,Program Manager,3,"Challenging work environment where you can grow and learn, even as a non- engineeer.  Leadership cannot figure out how to properly develop, staff and retain talent.  The past 5-6 years has been a constant reorganization and change.  They rely on consultants to give the answers instead of the senior leaders doing what they are paid to do.  Too much red tape for people to deal with.  The fix should start at the top but it does not. "
Cummins,Advanced Engineering Technical Leader,4,Great place to work with plenty of room for advancement. People are great to work with and management has a good pulse on the day to day workings of the company

Cummins,Eletrotécnico,5,"Excellent company to work, organized, pays well and has flexibility and many functions available to learn and develop your professional career"
Cummins,Validation Engineer,4,Good retirement benefits. Work can get a bit hectic. I am not too sure how often people progress within their roles. You have to do a lot of communication and networking to progress within the company.

Cummins,Driver Tech Sales / Safe and Secure Transportation of Equipment,2,What is the best part of working at the company?My position was based on trust!  and Getting to know the customers . What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Micro managing ! Can’t get any answers? What is the work environment and culture like at the company?You’re pretty much on your own !! there’s no reaching out to anybody for any kind of matters !! What is a typical day like for you at the company?Cover your calls pretty much same old just a different day !! If you finish your pms early you get a bonus but the tax man will take most of it!! And when you do the math it doesn’t add to much!!  Not much of a Incentive .. since you will just have to do other techs ? pms
Cummins,Sales Representative,4,I really liked mytime at CA however when they sold the company it became less of a family feel and very much more corporate.  I left soon after.  Do your homework first.
Cummins,Supervisor,1,not what it once was. upper management has ruined everyones moral. walking on eggshells everyday. no praise for a hard job completed. always wants more no matter what you do
Cummins,Materials Handler,3,"I have a love/hate relationship with this job, some days im having a blast, some days i just wanna quit. you make good money working here but at the same time they work you like a slave, and you have no time for a personal life. a lot of the people i've met here are really nice and we get along very well and it helps me get through the long nights."
Cummins,Senior Technical Specialist,1,It's 100 year old company for Diesel engines. With that going down most ppl are busy with forming teams and creating work instead of actually working towards a goal. It's all about creating roles. Most technically capable and experienced ppl are thrown out of company on name of VRS every 2 to 3 years. It's on track to become a portfolio company and does not aspire to be an engineering company. 
Cummins,Technician,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?Friday at four o’clock is the best part of the week What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Dealing with management on a daily. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Upper management needs to clean house bad. Other than the absolutely horrible management everyone gets along nicely What is a typical day like for you at the company?Wake up at 6am, get dressed for work, get in my car, sit in my car for 30 mins contemplating my life decisions, drive to work, work form 7-4, get back in my car, do 100mph+ hoping a semi cuts across the lane, get home, sit in my driveway for 30-45 mins, get out, go inside and dive into a nice bottle of crown and a 24 pack, got to bed around 9pm and repeat"
Cummins,Engineering Technician,3,"I’ve worked all over that plant, experienced the good and the bad. Assembly and machining are fun, made some good friends. Management is very dysfunctional. Engineering department restructures often, no job security and is like a cool kids club, no training and it’s sink or swim. Nobody tells you what they are looking for and expects you to be a mind reader with again, zero training. "
Cummins,Opérateur sur ligne,3,"The positive points are the salary of bonuses, meal tickets, holiday vouchers, CE, restaurant.Otherwise, the negative is the hypocritical and cronyism atmosphere, especially to the presence of very many small chiefs from production, often useless, not very competent and lazy, who favor and protect those who are in their goodpapers and who know how to make the boot lick with them.Hakslers (former and friends of small chefs) are also protected by these same people.I followed the instructions of the management to report my harassment (because they encourage to report it), but, in the end, I was forced to stop and resign, the harassed were protected, and I, notAt all, nothing, no help ..."
Cummins,Assembly Line Worker,4,"Within 15 mins of starting the shift this morning we were told to stop because the line was waiting for wrist pins on the X15 line. We won't make quota today so any that we miss is going to be tacked onto Saturdays build. My thing is, why is it our responsibility to make up for someone else's lack of attention? Why doesn't Cummins have a notification system in place for 1st shift so they can tell us to come in an hour later? They have such a thing for 3rd, why not 1st? Little things like that tells you what management is all about. Not us down here on the assembly lines, that's for sure. We are the automated pions that do what their told. Nothing more. "
Cummins,Assembly Technician,5,Good place to gain experience. Not perfect but plenty of potential. Plenty of work within a shift. Plenty of in-house trainings.                      
PNC Financial Services Group,DEVELOPMENT ADVISOR,5,PNC is a leader in the financial sector and continues to redefine consumer and corporate banking. It was exciting to work for an organization that was always looking to become better and more responsive to the needs of its customers. Employees are great and benefits are competitive.
PNC Financial Services Group,Branch Banker,2,"Working at PNC Bank can be challenging, with limited work-life balance and VERY low pay, making it less ideal for long-term career development. The environment often includes micromanagement, with employees expected to work six days a week. However, it can be a decent starting point for high schoolers seeking internship opportunities to gain experience."
PNC Financial Services Group,Banker,3,An opportunity to learn business hands on through customer interaction. Each day is an opportunity to learn something about both finance and details from business owners.
PNC Financial Services Group,Relationship Manager,4,I enjoyed my time working as a Relationship Manager in the Wealth Management department. Everyone I worked with was very professional and helped while I was there. I ended up moving into a completely different field but enjoyed my time there. 
PNC Financial Services Group,Branch Sales and Service Representative,3,"If you are applying as a banker you should not stay more than 2 years. They have high goals. Management micromanage the bankers. Managers don’t assist bankers to grow, they do not want bankers to leave in a sense that more a banker reach her goal, more the managers get paid. Get ready to work 6 days a week. Even if you are the highest rated banker, you can never work in the corporate or your desired role. Because managers don’t you to leave your role. Do NOT WORK FOR PNC BANK. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Teller,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Benefits and most of the weekends off What is the most stressful part about working at the company?micromanaging, short staffed all the time  What is the work environment and culture like at the company?toxic, you couldn't be you, I know you have to act professional but is okay have a couple of laughs with coworkers. What is a typical day like for you at the company?welcome to the unknown: short staff?? someone sick?? someone crying??  people using fingers to tell another person what to do. UNKNOWN"
PNC Financial Services Group,Branch Manager,5,"I don’t have much to say about it. it is like any corporate job. Everyone is supportive. However, they expect you to do too many things at the same time. "
PNC Financial Services Group,AML Investigator,5,You feel appreciated of working in PNC. Supportive training team as well as management team. Senior managers are available as easy as your manager. Kinda job security feeling as during COVID PNC did a great job and kept all the employee even compensate them to stay.
PNC Financial Services Group,Personal Banker,4,"PNC is a good company with very good products for consumers. So, its not too difficult to sell. But the pay can be pretty low for bankers, the commission is really how you make your money. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Bank Teller,1,"Benefits aren't bad and pay is a little higher than other banks in the area. However, there is SUCH LIMITED STAFF you can't even call off comfortably without screwing over your whole branch because there's only two other people to cover. Upper management makes ""one size fits all"" changes that make no sense for some branches. They cut staffing and decided to pay when an employee gets perfect tens on all their survey's for the quarter but are now putting out very few survey's to recover from the bad you get because people are mad at having to wait so long. I used to recruit people all the time to work here and I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE WORK AT PNC BANK NOW. PNC is falling into the corporate greed section along with all the other corporations. ""Fed up"" is an understatement."
PNC Financial Services Group,Remote,5,Wonderful place to work. Great pay. I’m sure it has changed since I’ve been employed there but I recommend this company 100% you will not go wrong with this company 
PNC Financial Services Group,Teller,4,It is a fun place to work if you enjoy customer service. I think they downplayed how much selling of products the job entailed during the interview process. 
PNC Financial Services Group,Manager,1,Lack up upper management support yes. They don’t know how to manage and have work life balance it’s always something changing and not good for the customers.
PNC Financial Services Group,Banker,3,"Fair company opportunities for growth. Branch layout makes client traffic hard. Once you get the basic idea of the products, they truly sell themselves you just have to understand the terminology."
PNC Financial Services Group,Analyst,4,The hours are good and the people are very collaborative! The program set in place for new incoming analysts show how much the company cares about employee retention and becoming successful at what they do.
PNC Financial Services Group,Senior branch banker,3,"Pay was low, not too many opportunities to grow, and bad management all the time..Very high pressure to make sales and make cold calls almost all day long."
PNC Financial Services Group,COLLATERAL PROCESSOR SR,3,You will be laid off. They do not like to give raises. They do not like to promote from within. No loyalty as does any business do not work in the lending area 
PNC Financial Services Group,Personal Banker with teller capabilities,4,"They have all these rules and requests for you to achieve in a day or week or month that are not written down anywhere but verbally communicated.  If they are not done to their satisfaction no matter sick days nor helping other branches, you are subject to them putting you on a plan.  Each branch has steep goals no matter the area and the areas considered low income or financial centers still have goals like the rest,  no different.  They say they care about the clients but they only care as far as you can sell the people something.  You don't get credit for disputes or online banking help or fraud.  They do not care about those people.  They come up with random meetings that could have been summarized in an email just to fill a back office person's day up.  Even the eco partners are seeing maybe 1 out of 7 appts show up for their actual appt.  It's all about metrics and appts. You could float bye for awhile but after that it's buh bye. They pretend to care but they don't. Some people don't even get lunches cause they run so short staffed. They have random people over other random people that pop out to watch you when they think you are not performing to what they want you to. One manager can kill your career here. There is much more. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Teller,3,"Good job, just can get extremely slow and boring on a college campus with not many people coming in. Training was dismal and we were left to our own devices for the most part "
PNC Financial Services Group,Bilingual Customer Service Representative,5,I liked my time working at PNC Customer Service Center. It was my first corporate job in the USA and helped me learn a ton of English. Great benefits and opportunities to move up or laterally within the institution.
PNC Financial Services Group,AVP Operations,3,"Management can be both good and bad, depending on who you have. I have a good manager who listens and is helpful. Work can be stressful at times and extremely stressful depending on the team you're on but the people you work with makes things better. "
PNC Financial Services Group,DEVELOPMENT ADVISOR,5,PNC is a leader in the financial sector and continues to redefine consumer and corporate banking. It was exciting to work for an organization that was always looking to become better and more responsive to the needs of its customers. Employees are great and benefits are competitive.
PNC Financial Services Group,Analyst,5,"Great place to work , life balance, great benefits, great leadership skills, good training, there was any issues working with PNC. I will refer and recommend anyone to work with PNC"
PNC Financial Services Group,Business Banking Specialist,3,"The calls are back to back most of the time and the clientele are very entitled to say the least. The technology used is very old. The policies dont make sense, and you can’t really move upwards if you don’t live in an area with a corporate office "
PNC Financial Services Group,Customer Service Representative,4,"Great place to start out. Upward mobility if you want it. Nice culture and work from home opportunities. Go corporate instead of branch level, more exposure."
PNC Financial Services Group,Banker,1,Every few years throws out staff and gets new employees. There is no room for promotion. They will keep your salary same and perhaps give you a few cents increase.
PNC Financial Services Group,Teller,1,"PNC is a good place to work at given that it is a commercial bank that is well-known. Other than that, the job responsibilities are too heavy for the very little pay. The hours are also too long in the day (9-6) and Saturday hours are also a bit daunting (9-2). the management I came across at PNC was simply the worst. No consideration for personal matters that  need attention, and no care at all for your career growth. I would recommend PNC to only my enemies. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Senior Application Support Engineer,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Many opportunities for to change positions and grow What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Many parts of the organization are out of sync with each other.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?You are rarely rewarded or appreciated for your efforts.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Firefighting several things while balancing new work
PNC Financial Services Group,Teller,4,"The job itself is easy and can be really fun at times. Most customers are easy to work with and I really enjoyed getting to know all of the regulars. I loved my coworkers on the teller line and got along well with the bankers. Manager is somewhat ineffective and didn’t really make me feel valued. I worked here for 2 years and was an award-winning employee, but was still overlooked for a full-time position which is ultimately why I left. Overall, PNC is a pretty average financial institution to work for I think. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Systems Reliability and Support Specialist,1,"You are really only a number and dollar figure here.  There truly is no work/life balance (I know some working up to 80 hours a week no break even though they ""preach"" it and managers don't care or do nothing).  There is a lack of good management (including executive management) as well unless you are fortunate to find one of the good managers within.  Compensation each year is on the slim side.  Don't plan on retiring here as many are laid off before their retirement dates or in mid-retirement processing. Benefits and PTO are about the only thing good.  You can find a better work environment and opportunities elsewhere."
PNC Financial Services Group,Personal Banker,2,"The organization from a high level is great.  They are strong and have a great vision for the future.  However, from the mid-level, there is a gap between the company vision and what occurs in the retail branches.   Branch managers aren't willing to adapt to changing environments,  open to feedback, or implement and adapt to change,  especially in smaller markets.   As much as I enjoy working for PNC, because of poor compensation regardless of taking on multiple projects above and beyond my job scope and toxic branch leadership that is more worried about creating a ""family"" culture that they use against employees and lack of HR/ER support I will be looking elsewhere. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Treasury Management Officer,5,"PNC is a very stable company which makes you feel very secure in your job. Things can tend to move a bit slow but that is a product of the banking industry as a whole and not the company. PNC is very diligent about employee growth, weather it is improving at your current role or getting ready for the next step you will always have the tools you need to grow. There is a very open and honest expectation that professional development is spearheaded by the employee so don’t think things will be handed to you. There is also a very clear agenda of promoting within rather than looking outside first. Often times a current employee that checks 75% of the boxes will be chosen over an external employee who checks 100% of the boxes. Leadership has always been great for me, I can honestly say in the 8 years I have worked here I have never had a bad manager. Overall I truly enjoy working for PNC, sales roles can get a bit stale over time as things don’t change often but again this is simply a product of the industry and not of the company. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Customer Service Representative,3,Great company and benefits! A lot of PTO hours and paid holidays. Only con is you’re stuck with whatever shift you receive and policies can be all over the place. Back to back calls
PNC Financial Services Group,Banker,4,"Good company, doesn’t pay very well.High selling targets for bankersLess bonus Tough to meet targets especially with slow traffic branches. Not many perks "
PNC Financial Services Group,Business Analyst,4,I worked for PNC for 5 years in many different roles. Never had a real issue other than pay being below what other banks offer their employees. Ultimately I left due yo a lack of advancement. 
PNC Financial Services Group,Customer Service Representative,5,"I worked in the Customer Care Department for Credit Cards at PNC and had a generally positive experience. The company offers comprehensive training, which helped me feel well-prepared to handle customer inquiries and credit card issues. The work environment was professional and supportive, with managers who were approachable and willing to assist when needed.One of the highlights was the job’s stability and benefits, which were competitive for the industry. PNC emphasizes work-life balance, and I appreciated the flexible scheduling options they provided, especially for those with personal or family commitments.However, like most customer service positions, the role can be stressful at times, particularly during peak call volumes or when dealing with frustrated customers. The metrics-driven environment also meant that performance was closely monitored, which could add pressure. Advancement opportunities were available, but they often required a lot of patience, as internal promotions could take time.Overall, I would recommend PNC for anyone looking to build a career in the financial sector, particularly if you’re seeking a customer care role with good benefits and room for growth."
PNC Financial Services Group,Development Program Analyst,4,PNC is a good company to work for if you’re looking for good company culture. I’ve had great managers and they care about your development. Promote within which is great. But externals get paid more than internals. Better to leave and come back for better pay
PNC Financial Services Group,Personal Banker,3,"I started my banking career at PNC. It definitely gave me the information I needed to decide whether I wanted to continue my career. But I felt PNC was behind in multiple ways: first off, their technology and infrastructure was lacking. Secondly, working till 6pm is a huge bummer. And most importantly, if you were scheduled on Saturday, you would work a 6 day week. Because of these things, I went to another financial institutions. PNC’s account and loan offerings are pretty good, though. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Personal Banker,2,"Absurd survey requirements that can reflect poorly on you even for issues unrelated to you. Call nights that keep you past closing hours that are not disclosed until well into employment.Bonus structure has a high ceiling but a high floor as well, feels out of reach for many employees"
PNC Financial Services Group,Principal Software Engineer,4,"Typical big business. You are a number on an excel. Benefits are good, WFH is good, pay raises are 0-1% even with exceeds expectations. Direct manager is all over the place due to pressure from unrealistic ""leaders"""
PNC Financial Services Group,Banker,2,"This company is a micro managing nightmare. They are looking for cheap labor and replacing all the management that got the company to where it is, affecting employees and customers. Employees are training managers, customers are wondering why no one knows what they are doing. I saw some of our oldest (wealthiest) clients close accounts. There is virtually no training before they send you to either sink or swim as teller or banker; this frustrates client! I’ve seen a really busy branch turn to a ghost town. People who used to go in for quality appointments now rush in and out for cash transactions. The quality of service and employees at PNC is directly reflected on the steps the CEO is taking to make sure his company is successful. They don’t realize how these changes affect the customers that have been loyal and have brought this company to a success."
PNC Financial Services Group,Branch Banker,5,Great stepping stone into other careers and industries. You learn a lot of information and make many connections when face to face with customers etc 
PNC Financial Services Group,DEVELOPMENT ADVISOR,5,PNC is a leader in the financial sector and continues to redefine consumer and corporate banking. It was exciting to work for an organization that was always looking to become better and more responsive to the needs of its customers. Employees are great and benefits are competitive.
PNC Financial Services Group,"Escalations Manager, Fraud Mitigation and Tech Escalation",5,The typical day depends on the department/line of business you choose. You could be in inbound and/or outbound. Their is great team communication and you stay in the know of what is going on in the center that needs to be addressed/how to address it. And everyone helps each other. The better we help each other the better we help the customer and it creates a positive work environment for everyone.
PNC Financial Services Group,Banker,5,"Pnc offers Great benefits, good pay and great work life balance. PNC is overall a good company to work for. Can’t complain about having holidays off as well. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Loan Processor,3,It was alright...had a great te a m...great opportunities for overtime. Management kind of showed favoritism and turn over rate was a bit high because they used alot of temporary associates 
PNC Financial Services Group,Customer Service Representative,2,"Pnc started off promising growth and a good work life balance. However the call volume is so high leaving you too tired to do anything after work, no growth even after meeting requirements. They do not do anything to make work easier for employees and they expect you to work through so many glitches and problems all while meeting unreasonable stats. Don’t recommend!"
PNC Financial Services Group,Online Banking Specialist,4,"I have learned a lot from working her over the last 5.5 years. However, the opportunity for advancement in a service level role (with my degree) and verifiable skills and credentials , is HARD! I have been passed over for a promotion almost 10 times. I am not eligible for a raise because I am my compensation cap for the role im in.  on the flipside, in service level roles PNC offers VTO, PTO, and some really really great benefits. That's the only reason im still there"
PNC Financial Services Group,Teller,5,"Excellent benefits are offered including parental leave, PTO, sick days and coaching. The company needs to look at management closely because certain branches have bad managers that cause good employees to leave. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Manager,4,Overall a great company.  Covid was handled poorly.  I was sad to leave but it was time due to limited opportunities for advancement due to corporate structure and inflexibility with where people live. 
PNC Financial Services Group,Receptionist,5,A typical day at the job consists of greeting customers helping customers on the computer. Assisting with day to day programs making sure everything runs smoothly.
PNC Financial Services Group,Teller,5,"Pnc as a company is a great place to work however at the king fort branch in Trenton the current manager is impossible to work with. She doesn’t follow up on anything regarding customers or employees and it makes for a very stressful day, every day. She is very short and often rude with coworkers and customers. She is always asking for help with teaching her goals but does nothing to help others reach their goals. It seems she is only concerned with herself and that is a daily cause of frustration and stress.  I left due to being denied a bonus because manager failed to follow up regarding my survey scores. I would work for Pnc again but NOT at this location. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Collateral Processor,3,"Depending on who your department manager is, this can be a perfectly acceptable place to work. Fellow employees are usually friendly and willing to help. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Banker,1,"Your experience at this company can vary significantly depending on the manager you are assigned to. While the job itself is generally manageable, challenges often arise with changes in management. The work environment is frequently understaffed, leading to an increased workload and added pressure on individual employees. The company places a strong emphasis on metrics and often employs a micromanagement approach, including unnecessary early-morning calls focused on the performance of well-located branches. It's important to note that achieving certain targets, like reaching tier 3, can be extremely difficult if you're not assigned to a favorable location. Overall, the company's culture can feel superficial and overly focused on appearances rather than substance."
PNC Financial Services Group,Product Manager,5,"Great people and great work life balance, low pay for industry though. It was a great experience, and I would recommend PNC to any starting their career. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Banker,3,"Your experience depends on the manager you get. The job was honestly fine, but when new managers come in it can be difficult. The job is often understaffed, and a lot of the busy work will fall on you."
PNC Financial Services Group,Financial Consultant,5,"PNC strives to set themselves apart from other banks and they do. They have a good culture and they are constantly working on new upgrades.  Management could have been better, more forward thinking and less old school."
PNC Financial Services Group,Capital Markets Analyst,4,"3 year development program is great, base salary is strong, but bonuses are heavily group dependent. Pittsburgh isn't the most fun city, so it can be a bit of drag"
PNC Financial Services Group,Branch Banker,4,"This is a great company but the only thing that it lacks is consideration for a promotion, most of the movement is for individuals that were with the previous company before merger. Other than that, training and work environment is really good with a great positive vibe."
PNC Financial Services Group,Teller Supervisor,4,"Was a great place to work until they started micromanaging, adding hours to your day to stay late to call customers. Only make money if you’re new. You can be working there for 15yrs and someone new is making a lot more then you and you have a higher position "
PNC Financial Services Group,Bank Teller,5,"I was hired thinking I was going into part time. Part time turned into full time which I couldn’t do at the time leave me to leave the company. Overall good job. Good pay, can be flexible with schedules and has great training on the job. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Customer Service Representative,2,"Barely have time between calls, Pay is good but could be better. Call center is open until 8pm CST. Have to be open minded and patient because customers can be rude."
PNC Financial Services Group,Fraud Analyst,3,"Hard to switch departments. Advancement is difficult. Management is pretty great, they work with you, however the company doesn’t always take care of there employees."
PNC Financial Services Group,DEVELOPMENT ADVISOR,5,PNC is a leader in the financial sector and continues to redefine consumer and corporate banking. It was exciting to work for an organization that was always looking to become better and more responsive to the needs of its customers. Employees are great and benefits are competitive.
PNC Financial Services Group,Detection and Investigation Analyst Sr,1,"I would steer clear of Card Loss Prevention department. They get you in under the impression you will be a fraud department. That’s not the case at all. You will take customer service calls and you’ll get calls from other departments (even departments above you) asking for help about everything under the sun. Other departments just drop calls on you and refer to it as a 24/7 help line. What you deal with on a daily basis doesn’t match the training at all.You would probably be better off in actual customer service. At least then you’ll actually get some holidays off and never work past 5pm on Saturday and Sunday. They are very big on advertising growing your career and hiring internally, but unless you actually know the right people, you will be stuck wherever you are. I’ve done everything they said to do, get a mentor, use a career advisor, join business groups, and I’m still stuck. I get passed up for every job that I’m qualified for or even overqualified for. Doesn’t matter.It’s embarrassing quite frankly. Your manager gets notified every time you apply to an open position and get rejected. I only recommend it if you’re desperate, just need to get experience, or want your career to be at a standstill. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Work Experience: Loan Support Analyst SR,2,"Peers won't assist unless you're in a ""click"" with them.Learned not to trust your co workers or manager.Senior management is a joke. Dealing with middle school behaviors.Assisting clients and agents with their banking needs."
PNC Financial Services Group,Customer Service Representative,1,What is the best part of working at the company?Paid time off . It’s remote .  Customer service repWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Horrible team lead you are expected to be a  robot not a human being What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Diversity and inclusion  but it’s fake the company Is too big to feel includedWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?8 hrs 2 -15 minute break and 1-30 minute lunch phone calls on right after the other
PNC Financial Services Group,Senior Analytics Consultant,5,"While PNC supports diversity, they are ultra conservative from a customer perspective.  Risk management is a top priority.  PNC expects long hours, but tries to offer work/life balance."
PNC Financial Services Group,Detection & Investigation Analyst Sr,4,"The role is demanding but fulfilling, requiring dedication but offering immense personal growth. The workload is taxing but empowering, as it drives personal and collective achievement."
PNC Financial Services Group,Investigation Analyst,4,I was only there for about 7 months. I worked fully remote and didn’t deal with costumers. Job just got boring after a while and was very repetitive. PNC does have great benefits though 
PNC Financial Services Group,Sr. Business Analyst / Senior Technical Project Manager,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?PNC has become top bank, through their strong leadership team. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?In my opinion Sr. Managers are just that “Managers”. I did not see that group as courageous leaders.  Also, I don’t feel that the HR group exerts much effort in supporting their employees. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?I did feel that the employee base were supportive."
PNC Financial Services Group,Representative,3,"Benefits are nice, calls are back to back which can be stressful. Hopefully will be able to move up to a better position. Management is pretty good too. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Assembly atms,5,"It was good. I learned a lot, from electrical, good assembly to make arms for world wide. I liked it a lot, because I learned a lot. Electrical was a big one "
PNC Financial Services Group,Technology Specialist,2,Majority of the people working in technology are not very smart. Lots of people faking it. They hire a lot of people from TekSystems and other agencies who are not at all qualified. The occasional talent they do find never stays because they won't them competitive wages. The benefits are expensive and 401k match is low. There is a pension. If you're a good developer or engineer don't work here. 
PNC Financial Services Group,Customer Service Representative,3,It’s an ok place to work. Slow moving up in the organization but an ok company at best. I recommend working here for an entry level experience. Nothing too bad to say
PNC Financial Services Group,Call Center Representative,1,"The best part of the job was the work at home and benefits. The workload, management, and ways to advance career are horrible. Toxic management has no problem belittling you while ignoring your goals you have made. No recognition for meeting goals consistently. If you use all your company approved time off before end of year, they will deduct that time out of your last check. Looking to grow your career good luck, cause pnc is not big on giving you a clear path to navigate and tells you to just apply and see what happens or that you should just go to a diffrent department and suck it up until the position you want is available."
PNC Financial Services Group,Escalations Specialist,4,Very team oriented. Great place to learn and grow your career. Worked there for 5 years and gained a lot of knowledge to help be successful today in my career.
PNC Financial Services Group,Banker,2,"Very strict working environment, unrealistic metrics. They say you will get commission but it takes AWHILE to earn anything worth it. The hours are long and requesting time off is almost impossible. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Telker,3,"PNC doesn’t hire enough people, branches run with bare minimum of staff.  This is fine unless someone is sick, or on vacation, or sent to help another branch- which is most of the time!  10 hour days with little work/life balance "
PNC Financial Services Group,Business banking,5,Ok company overall. Management is not very helpful to remote employees. Hard to get help. Basically after training you’re on your own and training itself is not great.
PNC Financial Services Group,Branch Manager,5,Lots of room for growth and development.  Company cares about employees career development. Can feel a bit micromanaged and retail staffing has become slim. 
PNC Financial Services Group,Customer Service and Support Senior,3,"The company is okay because I do have a lot of accommodations, but it’s very hard to advance your career. You get stuck in a position and that’s it. The job isn’t hard, but policies and the lack there of makes it hard. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Commercial Transaction Coordinator II,4,"(Working in VF Division of the bank, can't speak to how other divisions are)-Relaxed company culture (within reason, we are a bank after all and that demands  a certain level of professionalism and accountability)-Generous 401K plan and PTO, benefits are generous and competitive with industry.-Salary is fair for entry-level position (to my knowledge and based on my actual responsibilities). -Limited growth opportunities within my division - management is incredibly supportive of employees moving around and trying new roles, but these roles are all within the VF division (not the bank at large), so this can feel a bit limiting, especially if one is not interested in the VF market.-A  well-managed organization - you will not be reading headlines in the newspapers about egregious violations of consumer banking law. They play by the rules, they grow consistently and responsibly and job security is not somehing you worry about. "
PNC Financial Services Group,RRT,3,"Decent place to work management can be very helpful but some managers can be micromanaging but overall the benefits is nice, the pay is a bit low but the environment at the branch is ok."
PNC Financial Services Group,DEVELOPMENT ADVISOR,5,PNC is a leader in the financial sector and continues to redefine consumer and corporate banking. It was exciting to work for an organization that was always looking to become better and more responsive to the needs of its customers. Employees are great and benefits are competitive.
PNC Financial Services Group,Personal Banker,3,"PNC is a good company to work for with great benefits, smaller branches may have a harder time trying to hit company wide sales goals that are standardized regardless of traffic. Upper management is very helpful but turnover rate can be an issue along with sudden changes. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Testing Analyst,5,Its a great place to work overall no real complaints. The pay is decent for the work you and the work life balance is definitely reasonable. The only con I can think of is the recent layoffs that have affected a lot of people.
PNC Financial Services Group,Team Leader/Supervisor,3,The company can do a better job at paying their leaders. Raises are very small and few and far between. Always told it is not in the budget to offer a raise. No matter what your review is and how hard you work. 
PNC Financial Services Group,Bank Teller,4,"Will teach you important skills to have as well as maturity. You have to identify certain risks and threats that comes with the job. Remember that up to $250,000 is always insured so never ever try to stop a bank robbery, your life is more important. Even if you’re right, let the customer win, it’s not worth your time and patience. It will teach you to not let small things get to you. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Teller,4,Good consistency job. Can be fast paced at  tines and dead at others. Customer service is key to this role and there is a rating system that is random.
PNC Financial Services Group,Teller,3,My time at pnc was interesting and a great learning experience. I learned a lot and received great quality banking training. It was a good company with decent pay. 
PNC Financial Services Group,Underwriter,4,PNC is a good company to work for.  Benefits are outstanding but pay scale could be a bit better.  Managers truly care about their teams. Most managers are very knowledgeable and will assist whenever needed.
PNC Financial Services Group,Branch Operations Manager/ Acting Manager,4,"Productive, involved and engaged while focusing on activities necessary to manage sales, service and risk management. Leant a lot on banking processes, risk management, sales management. Management is approachable and transparent, supportive. Much engaged culture with events and community activities and branch engagement with clients. Hardest part of job is coaching different individuals to perform at highest level and managing performance and sales. Most enjoyable is connecting with colleagues and clients to support financial wellness and address pain points to resolve issues."
PNC Financial Services Group,Business Banking Customer Care Specialist,5,Seriously great company. They truly care about their employees. They encourage diversity and inclusion. They provide great benefits. I had to quit due to a personal situation and I honestly hate I had to do that. Trying to get back with the company as soon as possible. 
PNC Financial Services Group,Trust Officer,4,The Philadelphia market was the place to be in the trust department. Great managers and coworkers who really help develop the staff. They also know how to celebrate success. 
PNC Financial Services Group,Branch Banker,3,"Working in the right market can make all of the difference in reaching your sales and personal goals with the company. However if you are in a struggling market you will basically chase a dangling carrot. Lots of turn over, lots of gossip, and favoritism. People are stretched too thin and frowned upon if they don't want to constantly cover for understaffed branches. A very chaotic and stressful environment "
PNC Financial Services Group,Bank Teller,5,The most enjoyable part of the job is the staff as well as the clients. Every transaction is different. PNC Bank is a wonderful place to work. Management is always eager to jump in a help with a challenge or lend a helping hand. They have such a great team at the Elizabethtown KY branch. 
PNC Financial Services Group,AVP,2,"What is the best part of working at the company?Worst company I’ve ever worked for, very toxicWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The unprofessionalism and lack of strategic direction What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Male dominated, not inclusive and very discriminatory What is a typical day like for you at the company?Business development-client meetings or internal meetings"
PNC Financial Services Group,Customer Service Representative,2,"When I worked with PNC in the customer service department calls were horrible. You did not even have a 5 second break before the next call came and it was always a customer upset about overdrafts or wanted to argue about their balance. Metrics were hard to maintain. Maybe it has gotten better, but I do not recommend. "
PNC Financial Services Group,Manager,4,I had a good experience working at PNC. Sometimes stressful from amount of work but little overtime and very good benefits. PNC Firstside building is green and very pleasant physical environment.
PNC Financial Services Group,Executive Client Relations Specialist ,2,"Culture is very toxic & political, (at least in my department). No work life balance, unreasonable work loads (when in a salary position), and this results in working way more than 40 hours and no overtime pay . It's a very ""corporate"" position and its made very obvious that employees aren't valued and you're just another number."
PNC Financial Services Group,Teller,2,No opportunity for advancement at PNC. Especially if you begin working retail. Unrealistic goals for bankers and management is not supportive. You will a teller forever if you stay with this company. Pay is not terrible but not worth the job. Not this location. 
PNC Financial Services Group,New Hire Coach,1,Focus has shifted from the employee and development to bottom line and metrics. Advancement is difficult and understanding is minimal.                                               
PNC Financial Services Group,Branch Service Representative,4,"Decent pay. Went from part-time teller to BSSR in less than a year. When I had to leave for medical reasons, my manager was overly supportive and even assisted me herself with all my fmla paperwork"
PNC Financial Services Group,Teller,5,great place to work. people are nice and helpful.  working with the public is a great experience.  It ables you to work on your communication skills.  i would recommend
Qualcomm,Staff Design Engineer,4,"Not much stress, pretty chill and fun workplace. Mostly an execution team, so would be busy when execution happens and apart from it there are downtimes as well."
Qualcomm,Senior Engineer,3,"very bad management, not easy to deal with, it is not a place where they let you grow your career, If it is your only option then join. pay is on average"
Qualcomm,Principal Engineer,4,"Many competent people who are good to work with.  Most hires come with a lot of prior experience which is great for coming up with the best ideas about how to do something.  You can ask anyone for help - some are too busy to help much but most will offer ideas or share knowledge.  After getting to know people a bit, most people are very welcoming and collaborative.  Working on advanced technology nodes and products affords opportunities to solve new challenges.  Not sure what things are like now but 2018-2020 there were many very good on-site in-person courses in Python and Machine Learning."
Qualcomm,Camera System Engineer,3,"The people here seemed laid back, especially old people. I think most of the semiconductor company don't have as fast pace as other big tech company. "
Qualcomm,Engineer,3,A very conservative company that claims to uphold their valuable 'company culture' when there isn't one at all -- or at least not one to be proud of. Constant lay offs. Rester and vesters. Not the best but not the worst place.
Qualcomm,Senior Program Manager,2,Qualcomm hires a lot of temps so they can overwork people and make them easily disposable. Seems to not be the worst place if you are actually a real hire for the company. Highly depends on your department though. 
Qualcomm,Senior Staff Engineer,4,Best part was working with really wonderful smart dedicated people. Worst part was always wondering when next round of layoffs were coming and knowing job performance was not the deciding factor for keeping employment. Saw a lot of technical magic happen.
Qualcomm,Sr. Electrical Engineer,5,"Great co-workers, very supportive and conducive environment to learn, contribute and grow. Very supportive managers, VPs and scientists. Could use some more attention from the headquarters."
Qualcomm,Software Engineering Intern,5,Flexible workplace with significant talent and ability to grow. Good development opportunities and resources in addition to strong management with clear goals and expectations
Qualcomm,Senior IT Engineer,4,"The company is employee friendly and provides all the benefits one can expect. The work environment is really good. You have a good learning atmosphere and you are free to experiment, try new things and improve the solution you are developing"
Qualcomm,Computer Technician Assistant,5,Minimum do not let those who smise work do not let her wait
Qualcomm,Senior Accountant,5,Great company good culture compensation can be better. Leadership is not favorably looked on internally. Driven by investor sentiment rather than employee 
Qualcomm,Administrative Assistant,5,"The workplace has a fun and nurturing environment. Lots of company holiday celebrations, team building events, great workshops, completed projects celebrations, etc.. I enjoy coming to work and I intend to stay with the companylong-term."
Qualcomm,Senior Software Engineer,4,"People are supportive, work life balance is excellent but because of the company size you get a small piece of work and sometime you might not feel work challenging ,if you like challenging work. I would say work at Qualcomm is not well structured or organized because of which sometimes you will feel very relaxed and sometime bombarded with work. But may be because of this nature I found my work-life balance. So some may get irritated because of this. The thing I learned most is how to get visibility you will have to be vocal, share your  true thoughts & opinion without any fear that's the key to get attention- no one takes it to heart it would be for that moment. Hardest part of my job was to organize the working of cross-functional team, convey their is some organization needed in how we work. The enjoyable part was talking to my team as friends & family and definitely those 2-3 coffee breaks, Table Tennis every day during work to relax my mind."
Qualcomm,Technical Sales Manager,5,"Stimulating and rewarding environment.Colleagues not always up to par, especially in the Italian team, but the global approach of the compensation company.Good chance of learning and professional growth, even if it depends on the sector in which you are."
Qualcomm,Intern,5,"Worked here every summer in college. Was happy with my managers, compensation, the intern housing, and perks. Great summer arrangement for a student.  "
Qualcomm,Machine Learning Engineer,4,Great company to work for. Knowledgeable employees. Most managers are quite experienced and good at what they do with only a few difficult to deal with ones. Overall great company. Pay is just average.                 
Qualcomm,Buyer,4,"Raises and stock options have plummeted, promotions almost non existent. Keep cheap labor over quality labor.  All perks go to upper level employees. But once you are salaried you do get FTO. Lenient management, flexible schedule.  "
Qualcomm,Staff Engineer,3,"Qualcomm is a good place to learn and grow in terms of technical know-how. Nobody questions you when you dig-deep; it's appreciated (unlike some companies like Samsung, etc.)But this learning comes at a cost in terms of Work-Life-Balance. Compensation may be high if you join, but it will be normalized (in terms of lower increments) if you joined with high CTC."
Qualcomm,Senior modem engineer,4,Worked for about 6years and had pleasant experience but the pay is not that good and nor are the benefits. If you are in Sam Diego then this company is good. It’s also good for early career
Qualcomm,Electronic Repair Technician (temp),3,What is the best part of working at the company?I cannot identify any time or place as the best part of working there.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The most stressful times started upon arrival and continued until the end of the shift.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work culture and environment felt strained and forced.What is a typical day like for you at the company?It starts calmly and proceeds downhill. All the engineers appeared to dislike a technician who was hired to perform an engineer's responsibility.
Qualcomm,Staff Design Engineer,4,"Not much stress, pretty chill and fun workplace. Mostly an execution team, so would be busy when execution happens and apart from it there are downtimes as well."
Qualcomm,Quality Engineer,4,Very laid back but also hands on. Flexible with time and location accommodations within reason. Wonderful team and friendly environment. Amazing food court as well.
Qualcomm,Validation Engineer,5,great company with lots of benefits and learning opportunities. pay is fair compared to marketNo consFasten paced environmentyearly bonus based on the performance
Qualcomm,Business Analyst,3,I found the work life balance does not exist.   I worked 24/7 and no compensation for the extra hours as an exempt employee.  The company has great benefits but I wish they would improve work/life balance
Qualcomm,Staff Engineer,2,What is the best part of working at the company?Good Renumeration and sometimes good workWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lot of work stress and unreasonable pressureWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work environment is not that greatWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Work on the assigned tasks whole day
Qualcomm,Integration Engineer,2,"Like many other Fortune 500 companies in the tech space, your experience is heavily dependent on your manager. And unfortunately, those who are promoted to leadership positions aren't the best leaders. Often times they are the ones who work the most.Promotions are dependent on your manager. Once you get to a certain level, it feels like the work load grows exponentially, classic problem of your manager seeing you do a good job, so you get more work. And that work never stops growing. And forget about setting a good work/life balance. You shouldnt have to justify why you DONT want to work a weekend, especially when the task at hand isn't crucial. "
Qualcomm,Senior Engineer,4,Work pressure gets high sometimes but overall nice experience. HR is slow. Time is flexible. Understaffed so need to manage a lot more work sometimes. Hiring is less. 
Qualcomm,Staff Engineer,5,"great work culture good environment, lotof fun team building, work life balance s goodOverall happy with day to day work, Learning wise good and good for career growth."
Qualcomm,Multimedia Developer,4,"Although there is a lot of negativity on the web regarding Qualcomm Hyderabad. I am telling you, it is a very good place. The pay is very high. People are very cooperative and Food is also good. 30 paid holidays in an year."
Qualcomm,Senior Software Engineer,4,"I did remote work . There was no restrictions of start and end time while working for development. Projects are easy going , giving enough time to deliver a quality work . "
Qualcomm,HR,3,"I really enjoyed my tenure at the company, but over the years the company felt like it cared less and less  about its employees, and cared more about its shareholders/board members. There was a notable company culture shift in the past few years. The money paid well and I learned a lot in my various roles, but like any large corporation, there was a lot of bureaucracy and miscommunication. "
Qualcomm,Operations Manager,3,"The place is full of senior management that isn't willing to take risks because they are too concerned about the impact on their own careers if they don't pan out. This is completely contrary to the messaging the company puts out to its employees. You are told to #whywait in regards to leaping to the next big thing, but when you actually attempt to do so, management shoots you down. The amount of systems and data managed in Excel is an excellent example. The place is ultimately a joke."
Qualcomm,RF HARDWARE ENGINEER,5,Best place to work. You will Getting a chance to work on all latest cutting edge technology on cellular and connectivity technologies. Best pay company.
Qualcomm,Staff Software Engineer,4,"There are a ton of opportunities to learn on the job from very smart people. Depending on the group, it could be very fast paced.  Good pay,  bonus and benefits."
Qualcomm,Engineer,2,Great company to work for good pay but this year not so much. fast-paced environment. Expect burnout and lots of work to be dumped on you. Management expect everything done yesterday     
Qualcomm,Engineer,3,Workload is big.  benefits are good. Work life balance  does not exist. Work start at 10am and you are expected to be in meeting with other overseas teams till 10pm. 
Qualcomm,Artificial Intelligence Research Assistant,3,"Most Directors and Management within the company were a pleasure to work with. Some budgets did not set them up with the necessary Team/Hiring Compensation to have a form of quality, but Directors and Managers still managed to persevere. "
Qualcomm,Maintenance Technician,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Working around a lot of good people for years. Qualcomm provides great benefits..What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working up and down on eight foot ladders most days.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?We have a great manager, he keeps us pointed in the right direction and supports our working efforts.What is a typical day like for you at the company?For me working in maintenance, typically we have a building where we are working above the ceiling servicing HVAC units with new filters and belts. It involves carrying your ladder down the corridor unit to unit."
Qualcomm,Principal,4,Smart people and good culture. Compensation needs to improve to attract more talent to get the work done.Good benefits including 401k match and medical/dental insurance
Qualcomm,Embedded Engineer,1,Only the food is good And it can be bit hyped viewed from outsideMy role was a bit repetitive and no growth also backstabbing and less work life balance 
Qualcomm,Sr. Business Analyst,3,"Working at Qualcomm was great. The culture is very collaborative and you will meet a lot of smart people. Everybody has Masters, PHDs, MBAs, etc. Things move very quickly and you have to be prepared to work with a lot of teams around the world, which means sometimes working 12 hours days or more.There is a saying in Qualcomm that the company is the 800 lb gorilla and it is true. For every little problem, Qualcomm will throw a lot of resources and crush it. This can backfire as it can be harder to make decisions when 15~20 people who are not familiar with a problem try to solve it all at once.The pay is extremely subpar compared to other companies. The CEO thinks that people should just be thankful to work with ""great"" technology, but the reality is that they are underpaying their employees. Meanwhile, the corporate jets and the CEO's son are well taken care of.I recommend working here if you want to learn about semiconductors, work with great people, and don't mind getting underpaid in the most expensive city in the US. "
Qualcomm,Staff Design Engineer,4,"Not much stress, pretty chill and fun workplace. Mostly an execution team, so would be busy when execution happens and apart from it there are downtimes as well."
Qualcomm,Hardware Design Intern,4,"My team at Qcomm was friendly, flexible, and low stress from what I could tell as an intern. Pay was also insane, they spoil their interns. That said, this early in my career I’m interested in a slightly more engaging job, and I got the sense that this specific team might become boring after a while, which isn’t always a bad thing.All that said, though, I’ve heard dramatically different accounts from other teams. Big companies like this can be variable."
Qualcomm,Engineering,1,QCOM Chennai is just a sweat shop where employees are treated like cattle; absolutely no vision or work life balance. Horrible place to work. The only reason people stay here is because people want to be in Chennai.
Qualcomm,Engineer,3,Tech stack is restricted to mostly C. And very C++.Work wise tech stack is limited.Good for Electronics background.CS people might not enjoy work.Not much development project mostly support roles .
Qualcomm,Project Manager,4,"Qualcomm Having Smart offices,Great teams to work,Everyday Engineering Learning opportunities with successful completion of goals. Technology Leaders of VLSI industry are Engineering Team's Business leaders."
Qualcomm,Engineering Operations Analyst,3,"The pay and benefits are great. However, management really depends on the team you're on. My management is not the best fit for me, and they micromanage every aspect of my day and they have been disrespectful and unproductive with their criticism. Their critique has not been constructive to my growth and often seems personal, rather than directed towards helping my professional growth. "
Qualcomm,Software Engineer Intern,3,"Work is good depending on team, knowledgeable colleagues and very helpful. Learning is pluswork life balance is lowlong hoursvision is not very clear "
Qualcomm,Material Handler,2,Worked as a temp from main building and moved to manufacturing building. Manufacturing building in shipping department. Supervisor doesn't care about your effort and will take things at face value.
Qualcomm,Systems Test Engineer,4,Good company for beginners and entry-level candidates. You will learn a lot.  Good health insurance coverage and other benefits. Great support in immigration matters.
Qualcomm,Engineering Technician,2,"If you're not related to or best friends with your manager, good luck. You will be pigeon holed and ground into dust. Firm is bloated is useless middle-management. It's crazy how many people must lose their jobs so the same terrible management can stay in place. They've had lay-offs every year for 10 years, do the math."
Qualcomm,Interim Engineering Intern,5,"Embedded hardware and software projects. Great team of experienced professionals, great benefits. Had a great summer filled with several intern friendly activities."
Qualcomm,Senior Engineer,5,Definitely one of the biggest challenges is to work on various different projects that help build up your skillset. It definitely helps with your technical skills
Qualcomm,Yard worker,1,Hard few weeks. Though it's saving money to you and your family and friends in there that says a lot. Hard job description and the Hours are tough enough 
Qualcomm,Systems analyst,1,Politics and hierarchy are the words that describe this place. Management is terrible. They don’t like growth . Pay is bad and toxic work culture. Wouldn’t recommend
Qualcomm,RF Engineer,4,"There is connections , and who knows who and who hangs with who after work, once a great company ,now not as good as before , a lot of nepotism and selecting favorites "

Qualcomm,Hardware Engineer,5,"good,Excellent team support and work with leading technologyGood pay and interesting workt. Qualcomm is a well-known technology company that designs and sells wireless telecommunications products and services. Chennai is a city in India known for its vibrant culture and economic activities.If there have been significant developments or events related to ""Chennai Qualcomm"" after my last update, I wouldn't have information on them. For the most accurate and recent information, I recommend checking the latest news sources or Qualcomm's official website. If you have any other questions or if there's a specific topic you'd like to know more about, feel free to ask!ConsWork life balance is team dependent"
Qualcomm,Software Test Engineer,4,"During my time here, I worked with people who were scared of lay offs in my team and other teams. This shows that the busniess is not very stable. The workers here are respectful and nice though."
Qualcomm,PCB Designer,5,"Enjoyed my time working at Qualcomm.  Would still be there, but was laid-off.The culture is great and was treated well.  Pay raise every year and RSU's also."
Qualcomm,Senior Maintenance Technician ,3,"Been working here total of 6years. What gets me by is my colleagues, received lots of support from each other. On my 5th year, I had made a mistake in the production line. After that day, FREQUENT  investigations by superiors to the point that I was depressed and lost morale. In this 5years, low increment, high OT, frequent forced AL due to plant shutdown. "
Qualcomm,Project Manager,4,"Great place to work, they offer remote opportunities which allowed me to gain experience in high tech industry. Like any tech company there is rapid change to keep up with. "

Qualcomm,IT Engineer,5,"Hi, I have been working for last 10+ years and had great opportunity to learn new technology. Employee benefits are one of the top in the industry. I love working here. "
Qualcomm,Materials Product Manager (9,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Flexibility and opportunity for growth.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?None that I can think of .  People work closely and there is a team work effort between employees.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?There are different backgrounds and cultures in Qualcomm and every one respects and works as a team. Openness and honesty feedback from coworkers and management. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Very busy and most of my day is spent in meetings and the rest of the day trying to get work done on time.
Qualcomm,Staff Engineer,1,"The company is in a death spiral, and keeps laying off people. The management is running out of ideas and just uses bad ideas. The CEO is promising so much in the earning but never delivered."
Qualcomm,Test Engineer,4,It's not like the place it used to be where you felt very proud to work here. Many colleagues left for better pay and opportunities. Insurance is great and open door policy allows it to be collaborative. 
Qualcomm,Senior Engineer,4,Very fast paced goad oriented work culture. you get to work with state of the art communication technologies. with pace comes stress and lack of balance. 
Qualcomm,Test Technician,5,"Best company to work for I worked fir a third party manpower, but wish o was their permanent employee . Some times it could be hectic but your hard work is always appreciated "
Qualcomm,SENIOR STAFF PHYSICAL DESIGN,1,"What is the best part of working at the company?A big company that operates with a very old mindset--managers get large bonuses and promotions while those under them get no recognition (verbally or financially).   Recommendation: get in at the highest level you can possibly argue for because you will remain stagnant there for a very, very, very long time...What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Managers lacking integrity to the point where they claim full credit for work in which they had absolutey no involvement.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?More time, money and effort spent on the current woke social culture than on employee or product development.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Set goals for myself to complete the tasks to which I've been assigned and/or committed myself to despite getting no credit or recognition for major innovations that have drastically improved efficiency, error reduction and throughput for multiple teams."
Qualcomm,Patent Counsel,2,"Fairly dysfunctional leader, ship based on hiring people that are not better than you to ensure that you don’t look bad. Technology is really fun though."
Qualcomm,Engineer,3,"Company outlook isn’t looking too bright. WLB is decent, has a lot of politics. Good place to learn. Surrounded by smart people. Pay is around average "
Qualcomm,sr staff engineer,5,excellent place to work.  life balance is adequate .  Great career growth potential .  I would recommend Qualcomm to anyone.  Not so easy to move from dept to dept though
Qualcomm,"Test Technician, Senior ",4,"Slow growth even when you go above and beyond. Very flexible schedule, so good work/life balance. Higher ups don’t like communicating with each other, so you get told different information for projects. But other than that, it’s chill. "
Qualcomm,Staff Software Engineer,3,"I had administrative manager, program manager,  mentor and none were available as a supportive resource. The job was completely remote and was difficult to integrate into the culture."
Qualcomm,"Telecomm Engineer, SR",5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Good, good people. We always had the latest and greatest of technology.The professionalism The opportunitiesWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Being on call. With all the new technology, it was difficult to troubleshoot things if you weren't able to stay on top of all systemsWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great. Alot of pride within the employees.What is a typical day like for you at the company?No day was the same. One day your configuring a new office in another country, the next testing equipment for executive events."
Qualcomm,Staff Engineer.,3,"Stay away from hyderabad qualcomm branch, if you want to grow or learn. Only positive thing is salary and job security.Bad work culture, scrap work will be assigned if you are from non-IIT ( irrespective of your skills).Most of the groups filled with cheap politics and lacks professionalism.One has to be street smart if he wants to grow ( technical skills not much required )"
Qualcomm,Senior Engineer,4,"* Good place to start your career in, with lots of learning opportunity across multiple domains in tech* Mostly decent WLB, may not be great in some modem teams, especially in launch time windows* Management needs better vision and communication to earn trust of employees"

Qualcomm,Software Engineer,3,Some team are good. you can learn more. but eventually politics take over. its big public company with lots pros and cons. Its a top heavy management. most of work is carried by low level engineers. worklife balance worst.
Qualcomm,Staff engineer,3,There are a lot of politics and competitions among different groups. Many mangers don't do anything but just politics. They promote people who don't work too much but only because they're their close buddies. 
Qualcomm,Admin,4,"Good place to learn. Can learn and see a lors of things.  Benefits are good. Medical, leaves and others.. a lot of extra off days given. Can claim for time off if working OT"
Qualcomm,Finance Manager,5,finance department is fast paced. prepare to work at an intense pace and long hours. promotion is mostly fair - but also depends on how late you are able to stay. promotion is more difficult for women with kids who have more restrictive schedules in the evening. 
Qualcomm,Staff Design Engineer,4,"Not much stress, pretty chill and fun workplace. Mostly an execution team, so would be busy when execution happens and apart from it there are downtimes as well."
Qualcomm,Hardware Engineer,3,"The pay is great, but you'll end up working long hours mon-fri and sometimes on the weekends. Work here as your first job to gain the experience in a fast paced company. "
Qualcomm,"Senior Manager, Operations",5,"Best place to work, great people, great opportunities and very competitive compensation. The company is in the cutting edge of technology and has great future on the changing tech environment."
Qualcomm,Engineering Technician,2,"Heavy politics involved in regards to reviews, even if you did a good job it all goes down to which shift got the most high scoring reviews and then everyone else gets the bad reviews"
Qualcomm,"Support Engineer, Staff",3,"28 years with the company and for the most part the people and the work culture, at least in my case, has been great.  Be aware the company seem to cut jobs domestically for jobs oversees about every 4-5 years.  They are doing that now.  They always cut quality people and those that make it through the layoffs deal with how it kills the moral and productivity."
Qualcomm,Intern,5,"Was a very easy internship, with good pay. Seemed like most people didn't do much work and most people worked remotely. Management seemed disconnected from other people but the culture was good."
Qualcomm,Software Engineer,3,"I've been working at Qualcomm for a couple of years now. The benefits are great and while the pay is slightly below what you'd see at comparable tech jobs, it's still pretty good. Looking for something more engaging."
Qualcomm,"Talent Acquisition Specialist, Senior",5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Intelligent and accomplished co-workers.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Difficult to fill positions. Having to figure out complicated and detailed processes on your own.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Transparent, empowering, taking ownership and responsibility is a must.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Research and execute. Interview candidates, formulate, justify and make offers. Update hiring managers."
Qualcomm,Engineer,1,"All sorts of rumors were flying around, some of which turned out to be true and others false. This is a sign of mistrust between management and employees."
Qualcomm,Hardware Engineer,5,"Good company with lot to learn. As a fresher it is good to start with service based companies where you get to work laterally in all domains. In MNC, as the team gets divided, you have to work vertically on one domain.                                                                                                                 "
Qualcomm,Financial Analyst,3,"Company policies are good. Company will do good in next couple of years.India Finance FP&A head is not a good leader. He lacks empathy. Employees are made to work on areas which are not of their interest. A good amount of work that Finance team supporting San Diego does is not Finance. It is pricing upload in tools, reconciliation, data download etc. Team is asked to work extra hours and over weekends to meet superficial deadlines. Everything is a priority here. Good folks are resigning.Qualcomm is a great company for engineers but finance folks should avoid. RSUs is a trap for finance folks as they might or might not get it every year.Good part of the job:Qualcomm as an organisation has employee friendly policies be it be food, travel, training, insurance. Everything is on an upper end."
Qualcomm,Research Analyst,5,"Excellent Morale. Great incentives, Moderate career advancement, good support for professional development activities, support for tuition, and such...."
Qualcomm,Programmer Analyst,5,Either you grow or grow at QC.  Got to work on industry-transforming projects.  Surrounded by some of the smartest and nicest people I've ever met.  You may sleep at the office from time to time as close deadlines are part of the culture.
Qualcomm,Software Engineer,4,"The work itself is challenging and lots of opportunities to learn different things if you are in good technical teams. A lot of  people, once they reach Senior Staff Engineer/manager level, just stop being productive. Keep pushing work to juniors while they coast along as they can get away with just being in meetings and doing sparse work. Too many people around for too long, which breeds complacency at mid-management level."
Qualcomm,Sr. Talent Acquisition Specialist,3,Organizational hierarchy is like a game of Guess Who. Training is non-existent so unless you’re a super seasoned rockstar IT/Tech recruiting guru with 15 years of technology industry knowledge (you basically have to have a technical engineering expertise to keep up with the Hiring Managers because they love to talk in circles and in their code/tech language just to sound relevant when a question you ask them has zero to do with the job description - asking a basic scheduling question sends them into a long dissertation about the project they are spearheading and how they need talent ASAP but pick apart every qualified candidate to shreds you send them). They hired over 500 temps in September and we were cut right before the Christmas holiday. Isn’t that nice? Multi-billion dollar company that cuts a huge part of their talent right before a holiday shows that they have absolutely no regard for people - just profits. Steer clear and work at another semiconductor company. This one is a mess and all of the TA managers are on power trips and they treat contract talent like garbage. 
Qualcomm,IT Support Engineer,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Good company, Good people at QualcommWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?My commute,  It was 40 miles each way.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very good environment, even the COVID 2 years I worked there."
Qualcomm,Business Process Analyst,3,Challenges abound as with most manufacturing environments. Management is under-skilled and support is never where it needs to be. The company had been having trouble in recent years due to bloat. Unfortunately combating this had reduced the useful tools that were widely available for everyone. It's a real shame. Technology companies will not make it. The people who built these companies are not on par with the people who built great companies of the past and is very reflective of the general downfall of humanity as a whole.
Qualcomm,Bluetooth Application Developer,5,"Good work-life balance, Great perks and solid support from management. Managers are open to discussion and help you guide through the early stages in your career."
Qualcomm,Staff Engineer,4,"This is a great company to work for in San Diego. But with a lot of tech companies moving down from Silicon Valley, it’s only a matter of time before their pay becomes less competitive. Work life balance in my department was good. Work from home wasn’t really available until Covid hit. But now that seems to be going away again. Great company to learn grow your career. "
Qualcomm,Great company and engineering,5,"Great company, with a an opportunity to contribute to leading edge technology.   Very engineer friendly, with a fast pace, process about right and very knowledgeable colleagues."
Qualcomm,Staff Engineer,5,Very engineering oriented environment with lot of knowledge people around who are friendly to work with.Projects are managed well Compensation is good Benefits are good
Applied Materials,Manufacturing Technician,5,"I started over a year ago. You will learn as much as you want to learn. I’ve enjoyed every minute of my career here, and I can see myself still being here 20 years from now. AMAT is truly inclusive and their workforce is diverse. The benefits are great, and they seem to keep adding to the list. They encourage professional growth, but they also encourage physical and mental well-being. I love it here."
Applied Materials,Process Engineer,3,"been working here for 4 years, most of the colleagues I met are helpful and friendly. Most process engineers are very hard-working and knows what they are doing. On the contrary many managers and directors don't know what they are doing. a lot of ineffective meetings taking too much time for working levels to be productive.  "
Applied Materials,Welder/Fabricator,4,Management seems to always want to make changes and rules that hinder your ability to do your job. Pay is on the lower side for what is asked from you. 
Applied Materials,Quality Lead Technician,5,What is the best part of working at the company?The opportunity to grow in the company and the culture.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Making deadlines if there’s any stress at all. It’s not a stressful environment.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?As good as it gets. Great! A very easy going work environment. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Get to work. Get settled in. Create a daily goals report. Then get started on it.
Applied Materials,Website Design and Mobility Architect,1,"The manager of my department was self-centered and insecure. My postion was remote, so a typical day was trying to get my manager to return my phone calls."
Applied Materials,HR,1,Productive and fun work. I’m so happy to work there. I learn a lot if things and could improve myself every day. The management good and helps to the workers. i like my gob
Applied Materials,Security Officer,5,What can I say it's a good job to have perfect for someone who wants a job that you can do with minimal experience or education definitely a perfect entry position into security work
Applied Materials,Material Handler,5,I been working at applied materials for 3 and half years. My colleagues are great never felt like dragging my feet to work . The facilities especially the food sold at the cafeteria is affordable. 
Applied Materials,Engineer,2,"Team members are fantastic to work with, and honestly help make working here bearable. There is a lot to learn here and many great resources. But new managers do not know how to shield their employees from unnecessary tasks and often don’t know how to manage their own work so they just hand it off to their already overworked employees. If you’re someone who wants to grow and go above and beyond, expect to be overworked and burnt out as you will be constantly be given job outside of your job role and grade as a “learning opportunity”, only to be given a good ranking with a mediocre compensation for it. The problem right now is the company is not doing anything to retain their current talent, so it’s a matter of time until all the people keeping the ship afloat decide to jump ship. "
Applied Materials,Sr. Quality Engineer,1,Your opinions don't matter unless you have been there > 25 years.  The management doesn't understand how mfg is done at good companies and is extremely reactive.  Make a big show in email and you might be heard after only 20 years there.  Work hard and do the details and you will be despised and forgotten.
Applied Materials,"Richardson, TX",1,Unorganized with no direction or expectation to move forward towards a goal. This company is not for everyone. Good luck if you get hired. Keep your head down and do as your told. 
Applied Materials,Customer Service Engineer II,3,"15 of 16 cses cut. Shift changes with no warning, rotating management, benefits were not all that great. Hope you like to cross train as they will buy smaller companies, fire the experienced engineers and then make you do there job as well"
Applied Materials,Manufacturing Assembler,5,"Work is great. Straight forward, management available, teamwork is prevalent, recognition abundant. My favorite employment since the military and wish I could get communication with former staff as I know they would welcome my return. "
Applied Materials,"Manufacturing Technician, 1 Year 4 Month, Applied Materials",5,What is the best part of working at the company?That company is the best company I ever worked. They take care of the employees and the quality of the work.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Nothing in there is stressful What is the work environment and culture like at the company?They have a great environment and culture What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work and get 30 minutes break and 1 hour lunch
Applied Materials,Customer Engineer II,2,"Management changed three times in the two years I worked here. I had a sense of purpose but there was no reward for working here, even when you are the go to troubleshooter.A senior manager said I could count on him whenever I needed anything then ignored me when my father died and I needed to switch to days for personal reasons. I ended up quitting this bloated corporation. The only thing that matters is showing up and filling out a work order. You don't even need to be talented or knowledgable to work here. As long as management can fudge the numbers, that's all that matters. The truth doesn't matter, the numbers do. A lawnmower mechanic would show these engineers up. I know I did. Also, only the sneakiest or quietest of people succeed in this up and down industry, unless you are management's friend/lapdog. "
Applied Materials,Manufacturing Technician,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Very stable company. Overtime hours is a huge plus. Very professional overallWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working six days a week does catch up to you at some point. Mandatory overtime does add a bit of stress to the equation but not having any overtime at all would be a lot more stressful.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The environment at Applied Materials is a great multicultural company and made me proud to work with all types of people from around the world.What is a typical day like for you at the company?A typical day at Applied Materials would be fast paced, fun and goal oriented."
Applied Materials,IT Project Manager,3,Not a place to work long term because they don't compensate employees that work there a long time unless they quit and come back.  Great health insurance benefits and 401 is OK.  Lots of great coworkers.
Applied Materials,Engineering Technician Gas Panels,5,"Structured work flow, always know what your to work on. Great staff- helpful, understanding, and willing to put employees first. Work schedule is employee friendly, coming in early and leaving before rush hour."
Applied Materials,Planner,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Task were challenging & my colleagues very helpful and informative.  Managing team easy to communicate with. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?None, I enjoyed the challenges of the workWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?They were embracing new hires with posite engagement What is a typical day like for you at the company?Laying out the schedule and interacting with other employees"
Applied Materials,Manufacturing Technician,2,"Avoid working here if you want to avoid management that is unfair and if want to avoid being in a revolving door. I was a contractor there for 3 years and never converted me. I had perfect attendance and did a good job. However, they will cherry pick who is converted. They even converted someone that I trained because management has favorites. Training is the worst, and many times new people are training new people. On a positive note, the pay was the best that I ever had but mainly because I came in with experience. They have mandatory over-time so will see larger pay checks typically. "
Applied Materials,Material Handler,1,Management is a joke. They string you along and nothing gets fixed. Don’t bother having an opinion or facts because they don’t care. Unless you snitch on every employee there your just a number. Basically have to be a brown nose to get anywhere and it’s not right. 
Applied Materials,Manufacturing Technician,5,"I started over a year ago. You will learn as much as you want to learn. I’ve enjoyed every minute of my career here, and I can see myself still being here 20 years from now. AMAT is truly inclusive and their workforce is diverse. The benefits are great, and they seem to keep adding to the list. They encourage professional growth, but they also encourage physical and mental well-being. I love it here."
Applied Materials,Manufacturing Technician- Assembler,1,"I love the job, fun to build the tools but what got me was the lack of job security, contractors and treated as disposable numbers.You don't get included in work outings/events. If the company was having a safety celebration only the full time people were allowed to go and the contractors got their hours cut and sent home for the day and would not be allowed to attend the celebrations. "
Applied Materials,Manufacturing Technician,2,"I worked at SMG and EPG as a contractor through Adeccoo For 3 years At Applied I have seen people making stuff up just to make you look bad in front of the managers so they can keep their response when the company gets slow. You will never be an RFT employee unless the managers like you and when you get an offer to be an you will get paid less money. For contractors if you wanna go to HR to complain about RFT employee, you will be the one to go home even though you’re the one complainingYou work very long hours and they expect you to work as hard as you can to finish the work but once you Make a mistake you go home..Worst place I ever seen"
Applied Materials,Materials Program Manager,5,Great place to work and good benefits.  Too many layers of management.  First line manager are often selected for the wrong reasons.  Lack awareness and empathy.
Applied Materials,Program Manager,2,Don't expect any raise until and unless you are good at bucketing. It is more of a family business then a company who looks into your performance to reward.
Applied Materials,Integration Technician/ Clean Room Technician,5,What is the best part of working at the company?Flexible with overtime.  They allow you to train in other departments. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Not knowing whether or not if they are going to hire you. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great people.

Applied Materials,Planner,5,"Learn something new everyday, endless opportunities & trainings. Management is fair. I really enjoy working here, great and generous benefits. If you are a hard worker you will go very far in this company."
Applied Materials,Data Analyst Intern,5,"Coworkers are nice and helpful ! I was working from home the whole time, so I did not get to have the whole working experience. Overall I liked working there"
Applied Materials,Program Manager,4,"stressful at times, generally supportive.  can be disorganized but trying to get things organized is my job.  big company so changes to move around if you want."
Applied Materials,Electrical Engineer,3,You would think a semiconductor company that does research is without politics but would be dead wrong. No one gets promoted here unless you are into politics and the manager has a reason to promote you -- they hire from outside in high positions -- the employees here get minimal raises and no promotions . People leave all the time and managers keep looking for more instead of figuring out why they left . 
Applied Materials,Engineering Technician,3,Tools disappear every day. Half my day was me looking for tools I needed to do the work. The other half was re-work. People smoked weed in the parking lot during breaks then went back to work. Pay was good. Work anywhere between 30 and 90 hours depending on seasonal needs. I hear each department is different.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?Just doing your job and finding time to talk with friends/coworkers.
Applied Materials,Engineering Technician,4,"Management is by far the worst part of the job. Everyone thinks they are your boss, directly. You receive little to no respect from anyone outside of your peers and the turn around of employees means the person you're working with on your team is likely to be green. With that being said, the company has great benefits like student debt forgiveness, 401k match, stock options, and a lifestyle fund of $500 per employee. "
Applied Materials,Engineer Technician Final Test,5,"What is the best part of working at the company?Employees are respected. Every employee own its position.

Applied Materials,Metrology Technician,1,"This job has been so dreadful to work for. The work itself is such an empty void, because you’re constantly working and working and it never ends. Management is in such a poor state that when I was hired on they weren’t sure what schedule I was given and they were the ones in the meetings hiring me to begin with. To this day, they keep giving us new tools, new procedures and more things to do and I haven’t gotten a single raise since I’ve been hired. Even then, this multi-billion dollar company barely dishes out raises. My entire crew, excluding me, barely got 3% which equates to about a dollar. This whole year they raved about how well we did as a group, just to give us a dollar raise. On top of that, management always seems lost, unsure, and outright disrespectful to whatever or whoever they work with. Overall, just a soul crushing work environment with lackluster pay and benefits."
Applied Materials,Final Test Technician,4,Fast paced grind type of job. Work hard to play hard. You take this job understanding that there is a lot of work to get done. Can’t think about the end just have to keep your head down and work.

Applied Materials,Customer Technician,3,"The work is great and they can pay you well, the issue is the management. Moving up in the company and getting raises is based on your relationship with the manager. They don’t know the tool/job at all so if your not good at talking with people, maybe it’s the job for you."
Applied Materials,Warehouse Associate,4,It's not a difficult job; lots of routine work.  They pay better than comparable employers.  Just a stepping stone till you upgrade credentials/education and move on.

Applied Materials,Employee Relations Investigator,4,"What is the best part of working at the company?Their values focused  on  the ethical business practices and supported their employees and customers fostering a open, trusting transparent environment to bring up issues and their ideas to resolve them. People who I engage with as a HR contractor were genuinely nice people and supportive. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Multiple caseload and their IT had different protocols for contractors vs employees. Our interface was restricted so video conferencing, sharing a views were limited. I didn't know this or my colleaguesat the time so my startup experience working remotely was impacted. I was fortunate enough my home office was close to the campus and I was able to resolve some of my issues and receive authorized privileges to access data and applications that I needed to do my daily tasks  I have to say it was awful experience at first. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?People, management and employees were good at making me feel welcome. They were friendly and approachable."
Applied Materials,Director,1,"Applied Materials looks great on paper but in reality it's THE WORST culture I have ever experienced.

Generally a very good emphasis on work-life balance."
Applied Materials,Manufacture Technician,3,"Applied Materials is a company that offers a great working environment but heavily depends on the management team. While some managers maintain professional relationships with their employees, there are instances where unprofessional behavior exists. Surprisingly, these unprofessional managers sometimes end up promoting their favored employees, which can be frustrating for those who value fairness and meritocracy. Additionally, the effectiveness of the Human Resources department seems to be a mixed bag. The level of care and attention given to employee concerns varies from one situation to another. On the positive side, Applied Materials is an excellent place for engineers to thrive and grow. The company provides ample opportunities for professional development and offers a supportive ecosystem for technical professionals. However, it is important to note that as technicians, the treatment received can vary depending on personal relationships and favoritism within the organization."

Applied Materials,Technician,4,Worse place to work at management has there favorites and will choose them over anybody that is willing to work hard. And don't follow there own safety policies only when it's convenient for them.
Applied Materials,Picker/Packer,1,"I worked here for my 18 month contract, was told if I put my head down and work I could become an employee instead of a contractor.  Busted my back 12 hours a day, feet killing me every day. Worked overtime, ran multiple machines at once, contract ended and was basically told to blank at the end of it. Went through 3 warehouse managers while I was there.  Not a great place to work."

Applied Materials,Engineering Technician,1,no one here honestly cares about anything you do until their superior comments on you and suddenly you start to see ur manager everyday? the managers dont know anything that's happening and dont even care. i was employed thru as a temp and honestly learned nothing after being there for 3 months. i literally walked in and did nothing for the whole time until i just couldnt do it anymore. i drove over an hour one way to get there and it was just a waste of time. theres no overtime unless youve been there for over 20 years. goodluck trying to be anything more than a number that this place…. 
Applied Materials,Manufacturing Technician,1,"lots of time in the cleanroom. youll find that your fingernails will go soft and constantly split. as for work, people show up late everyday and never get into trouble. incoming people will get paid more, but exisiting workers will have to fight for the same money. managers only push buttons. i had to search my mangager out several times after unanswered emails. the do have cafeterias. be careful, sometimes they dont feel like cooking things all the way."
Applied Materials,Engineer,1,"Health care benefits and annual base salary much lower than peers in semiconductor industry .  Yearly increases are almost what inflation rate is . Worst is management  -- mainly old people  who have been with the company 15+ years and steeped in politics with old boy mentality  . For new employee or fresh graduates, to get promoted into management is unheard of .  Job based training is bad and no one bother to help peers out .  Other  companies may be smaller but way easier to go up the corporate ladder than here . "

Applied Materials,Mechanical Assembly Technician,4,"If you are able to commit your entire life to this company then you will be moved up quickly. If you’re not able to commit every minute of your life to this company, they have no issue dropping you and replacing you. They only care about product being moved out. I enjoyed learning everything I learned and I enjoyed most of the people I worked with. However this company wants sheep and I stood out too much. They pretend like they care but if something happens to you, they are quick to call you a liability and move past you. This company is huge and every man for themself. They don’t raise pay much but you work 50-70 hours a week. You have to work holidays and a lot of times they don’t know if they are gonna or not until a couple days before."
Applied Materials,Machinist/Production Mananger,1,"California company, California Values!If your into learning about transgenders, pride month and drag queen bingo, masks, forced vaccinations, Applied Kalispell is for you!

Applied Materials,Assembly Technician,2,"I got hired as a contractor and worked for about 8 months before they offered me a permanent position. When you become permanent they give you over 100 sick time hours. What they don’t tell you is that if you use them they will fire you. I am a single mother and when I needed to take care of things for my son I used my sick time or PTO. Most of the time I was employed here I worked 60hour weeks. This company will over work you, and management does not care about your life away from work. You will never be properly trained to do every aspect of your job, this is why the turn over rate at this place is so high. Work for Samsung "

Kraft Heinz,Operator,2,"If someone calls in from the upcoming shift you have to stay up to 12 hours no matter what. Even if you are scheduled 8 hours you have to wait for your relief. Constantly having lines down because a lot of the equipment is old. Get moved around everywhere. So many lazy people and people that take long breaks with management never helping out or not caring. Lots of Saturdays to work so expect maybe only 1 day off. If you are in maintenance, expect to work your life away. Training there was nonexistent. Had to almost learn on your own. So many unsafe practices. "

Kraft Heinz,Category Advisor,5,"KHC really cares about their employees. And when personal things happen, my peers have stepped up in ways I have never experienced.

Kraft Heinz,Machine Operator,2,"This isn't just any company to work for you will sign your entire social and family and personal life away if you work here full-time. The hiring process is quite pleasant and the hiring staff are kind. The staff on the safety team talk about how certain things will get you fired ""even if its a one time incident"". However when precenting any ""near misses with improperly trained operators they will claim well...that isn't possible even though they weren't there."" The place has already had one fatality no need for another. There is a way to operate the machines around hard stop button. The staff there can be of all walks of life but that may include other employees who want to bring the lovely STL violent culture to work by such as making a threat in a room full of other employees to shoot someone else for a small comment about said person being late and nobody saying anything because they are scared of this mental individual. Such individual can get special treatment like hiding from duties and and you getting stuck doing their job too. This place will also have you be trained by folks who are all trained differently so you may end up doing a good job or you may end up doing a poor job due to what you were taught. Lots of people whom could care less and not take any kind of ownership and pride in their work but the few who do are amazing people to work beside with. Amazing opportunity to make plenty of money and get out of debt and build savings if you are willing to compromise alot of your personal time and manage your money right. Good insurance. Good benfits. "
Kraft Heinz,Recycle Operator,2,August 4 of this year would’ve made two years. However I decided to leave because promotion was based on favoritism and who you knew in upper management. I watched them hire multiple candidates who hadn’t been hired for even a year over me.
